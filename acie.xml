         <title>Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Electrolyte with High Transference Number and Fast Conduction of Li Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li&#8208;ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three&#8208;component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li&#8208;HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. Their LiFePO4/Li batteries exhibit high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Idealizing Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Film Competitive by Surface Lattice Etching&#8208;Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells are desirable for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing application in the future, yet the presence of moisture and oxygen goes against perovskite crystallization and deteriorates phase stabilization, leading to the formation of substantial defective nano&#8208;impurities, especially on the vulnerable surface. Here, we propose a strategy to simultaneously remove superficial defect layer and solidify the surface by soaking air&#8208;fabricated perovskite film into low&#8208;polar organic esters at elevated temperature to trigger an in&#8208;situ dynamic surface lattice disassemble and reconstruction process. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results indicate that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is first dissolved and then the Br&#8208;rich phase is recrystallized at solid&#8208;liquid interface owing to the balance between weak solubility and high&#8208;temperature induced annealing process, thus hardening the soft surface and releasing the lattice tensile stress, which benefits the minimization of interfacial recombination and improvement of the structural stability. As a result, we prepare a carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br device in complete air without precise control on humidity, achieving a champion efficiency of 15.37% with excellent resistance to harsh attackers. This method offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limit of processing conditions on advancing perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte incorporating 1,3&#8208;propanesultone additive has been developed to form a highly ion&#8208;conductive and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This innovation significantly enhances the performance and stability of lithium metal batteries in wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000&#8197;h at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000&#8197;cycles, retention: 67&#8201;%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.







Abstract
Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li+. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in the ester&#8208;based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO4 batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.

Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby weakening the interaction between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester-based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structures of a DNA Polymerase Caught while Incorporating Responsive Dual&#8208;Functional Nucleotide Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environment&#8208;sensitive C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified nucleotide probes serve as excellent substrates for Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq). The probes provided unprecedent insight into the chemical&#8208;space tolerance and incorporation mechanism of the enzyme in real&#8208;time by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy, and at the atomic level by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Functionalizing nucleic acids using DNA polymerases is essential in biophysical and biotechnology applications. This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, the responsiveness of FBFdUTP enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the plasticity of the enzyme. Key insight is provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyl sulfoxonium ylides are presented as a new type of monoaryl axially chiral framework. To access this intriguing scaffold, a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective iodoaminocyclization reaction of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides was developed. The optically enriched atropoisomers can be transformed into diverse chiral structures.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in the catalytic generation of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. Herein, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;encapsulated enzymes are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, ultrasensitive activity analysis of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). We demonstrate that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated, which exhibits high accuracy for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.







Abstract
Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we demonstrate a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n=63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92&#8201;%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrones are used as masked precursors that can be photoisomerized to oxaziridine bioconjugation reagents in situ or separately. This approach provides access to previously unexplored N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines, which modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan and in a proteomic context tyrosine residues, thus expanding the chemical toolset for protein conjugation and proteomic profiling.







Abstract
Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV/Vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage.

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the surface energy state of the SnO2 buried interface was modulated by proton precompensation treatment, which can inhibit the proton transfer behavior guided by proton affinity and enhance the stability of perovskite crystal, achieving efficient perovskite solar cells with significantly improved photothermal stability.







Abstract
The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90&#8201;% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000&#8197;h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the surface energy state of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; buried interface was modulated by proton precompensation treatment, which can inhibit the proton transfer behavior guided by proton affinity and enhance the stability of perovskite crystal, achieving efficient perovskite solar cells with significantly improved photothermal stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface prepared from SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain-limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) under coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90&#8201;% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000&#8197;h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non-radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55&#8201;% than the control devices (23.03&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of intermolecular polarity in metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction is highlighted in this study. By rationally modulating the core&#8216;s polarity of pyridine&#8208;containing imine&#8208;like COFs, we achieved 93.1&#8201;% selectivity and 90.5&#8201;% faradic efficiency for H2O2 production. This study paved the way for designing efficient and selective electrochemical H2O2 production catalysts.







Abstract
Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 at 0.4&#8197;V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5&#8201;%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H2O2 generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.

         <title>Multifunctional, Fluorene&#8208;Based Modulator of Cholinergic and GABAergic Neurotransmission as a Novel Drug Candidate for Palliative Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patients with Alzheimer's disease need immediate help. In this work, we present a new approach to treating cognitive deficits alongside the psychological symptoms of dementia. Through a combination of biological screening, crystallography, and computational methods, we have developed an innovative drug candidate &#8211; a dual modulator of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Comprehensive in vivo evaluation demonstrates its strong potential for a breakthrough.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in other neurotransmitters, such as &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to AD symptomatology. In the presented research, using a combination of crystallography and computational methods we developed compound 6 as a dual modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50=0.21&#8197;&#956;M) and GABA transporter 1 (IC50=10.96&#8197;&#956;M) and 3 (IC50=7.76&#8197;&#956;M), along with a favorable drug&#8208;likeness profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed the effectiveness of 6 in enhancing memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The innovative multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions Via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for modulating mechanophore reactivity is introduced by employing a cyclic pulling geometry to precisely tailor force transmission. This approach enables the construction of polymer materials with hierarchical mechanochemical responsiveness, advancing the field of polymer mechanochemistry.







Abstract
In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160&#8197;min&#8722;1 to 0.00133&#8197;min&#8722;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis indicates that the split force transmission along ring chains contributes to the significant difference in mechanochemical reactivity. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.

         <dc:description>
Described is a selective &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines. A chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was also developed to promote an enantioselective version of this reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98&#8201;% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared a regulated ZIF membrane with reduced defect density owing to the confined growth of crystals between the top layer and substrate. Such a membrane provides a superior H2/N2 separation selectivity.







Abstract
The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99&#8201;% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353&#8201;% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.

         <title>Crafting Molecular Tools for 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule modulators are essential for probing protein function, but their development is often limited by complex synthesis. We introduce a simple, one&#8208;step method to create multifunctional modulators. We developed a library for human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1, including probes, sensors, photocrosslinkers, and inhibitors. Our technology shows promise for complex biological applications, demonstrated by successful protein inhibition and labeling in vitro, in cellulo, and in vivo.







Abstract
Small molecule modulators are powerful tools for selectively probing and manipulating proteins in native biological systems. However, the development of versatile modulators that exhibit desired properties is hindered by the lack of a rapid and robust synthetic strategy. Here, we develop a facile and reliable one&#8208;step methodology for the generation of multifunctional toolboxes encompassing a wide variety of chemical modulators with different desired features. These modulators bind irreversibly to the protein target via a selective warhead. Key elements are introduced onto the warhead in a single step using multi&#8208;component reactions. To illustrate the power of this new technology, we synthesized a library of diverse modulators designed to explore a highly challenging and poorly understood protein, human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1. Modulators made include; activity&#8208;based/photoaffinity probes, chemosensors, photocrosslinkers, as well as light&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;affinity inhibitors. The efficacy of our compounds was successfully established through the provision of on demand inhibition and labeling of our target protein in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo; thus, proving that this technology has promising potential for applications in many complex biological systems.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Hybridized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, C60&#8208;Y, featuring a high dielectric constant and isotropic molecular packing, has been synthesized. The fullerene hybrid enhances exciton dissociation, reduces energy losses, and improves charge mobility. When incorporated into a ternary blend system, it achieved an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;%, outperforming other reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component.







Abstract
A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8722;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02&#8201;%, surpassing the 13.31&#8201;% achieved with Me&#8722;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.

         <title>Strong Replaces Weak: Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Anchored Electrolyte Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane to reconstruct hydrogen&#8208;bond network, solvation structure and contribute to excellent temperature adaptability. The hydrogen bond network in free water is significantly weakened, while that between sulfolane and water is highly strengthened. The zinc&#8208;ion capacitor shows remarkable cycling stability over 55000 cycles and excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4&#8197;V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8&#8201;% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7&#8201;% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Cucurbalsaminones B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biosynthesis of cucurbalsaminones, we accomplished the first synthesis of cucurbalsaminones B and C in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to adjust the oxidation state of the sterically hindered C11 position.







Abstract
Cucurbalsaminones B (1) and C (2) are two abeo&#8208;cucurbitane triterpenoids with a unique 5/6/3/6/5&#8208;fused ring system and exhibit potent multidrug resistance (MDR)&#8208;reversing activity. Herein, we report the first synthesis of these two natural products, both of them were accomplished in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to realize the challenging oxidation state adjustment of the sterically hindered C11 position.

Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane-to-cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa-di-&#960;-methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton-McCombie deoxygenation to adjust the oxidation state of the sterically hindered C11 position.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cucurbalsaminones B (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and C (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) are two &lt;i&gt;abeo&lt;/i&gt;-cucurbitane triterpenoids with a unique 5/6/3/6/5-fused ring system and exhibit potent multidrug resistance (MDR)-reversing activity. Herein, we report the first synthesis of these two natural products, both of them were accomplished in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane-to-cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa-di-&#960;-methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton-McCombie deoxygenation to realize the challenging oxidation state adjustment of the sterically hindered C11 position.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) can achieve dynamic structural changes from closed to open under the stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibits adaptive adsorption for C3H6 and C3H8, and exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent gate opening phenomenon, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.







Abstract
The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra (4&#8208;cyanophenyl) tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N

&#8943;

 ${\cdots }$



H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.

         <title>Paired Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a groundbreaking electrochemical ring&#8208;opening protocol for the direct synthesis of remote amino alcohols via copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential paired electrolysis under mild, biocompatible conditions. This method enables rapid access to a wide variety of remote amino alcohols with diverse functional groups, utilizing an electro&#8208;redox ring&#8208;opening approach for efficient peptide alcohol modification and assembly. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm that water serves as both the solvent and hydrogen source, generating CuH to reduce aldehydes to alcohols.







Abstract
Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are three ring fusion patterns from one chemical reaction. Carbocyclic heptannulation provides access to brightly fluorescent, chiral perylene diimides, which can be converted into highly electrophilic tropylium cations and functionalized by direct aromatic substitution reactions.







Abstract
The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity increase mechanism in rechargeable magnesium batteries featuring Cu metal is investigated through multiscale joint operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray characterizations. These analyses unveil that the capacity enhancement stems from the progressive electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu. This corrosion initiates irreversible depletion of both the Cu current collector and magnesium metal, ultimately resulting in cell failure.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature. Here, enantiomeric nanotadpole aggregates from helical poly(phenylacetylene)s formed 1D chains with favored head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and homochiral connections, stemmed from size difference in heads and tails and chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase, respectively, which deepens the understanding of hierarchical homochirality.







Abstract
Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.

Here, enantiomeric nanotadpole aggregates from helical poly(phenylacetylene)s formed 1D chains with favored head-to-tail and homochiral connections, stemmed from size difference in heads and tails and chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase, respectively, which deepens the understanding of hierarchical homochirality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well-explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality-amplified co-assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw-sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head-to-tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion, featuring symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo sites for strong coupling and activation of nitrogen (N2), and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure that dynamically adapts to rapidly changing intermediates, lowering formation energy barriers. Together, these features enable exceptional N2 fixation activity. This bioinspired approach paves the way for designing efficient catalysts for complex multistep reactions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d&#8208;electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71&#177;1.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38&#177;1.03&#8201;%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. In their Research Article (e202412591), Chao Gu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d transition metal&#8211;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H &#945;&#8208;Acetylation: Generation of Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new C(sp3)&#8722;H acetylation methodology for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones that enables the construction of quaternary C centers via copper catalysis. A t&#8208;butoxy radical derived from tBuOOtBu engages in H&#8208;atom abstraction of an C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in substrates R&#8722;H to generate radicals R&#8226; captured by copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ph) formed through acid&#8208;base exchange between [CuII]&#8722;OtBu intermediates and ketones CH3C(O)Ar to give &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;substituted ketones are important chemical targets as synthetic intermediates as well as functionalities in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report the &#945;&#8208;acetylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates R&#8722;H with arylmethyl ketones ArC(O)Me to provide &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones ArC(O)CH2R at RT with tBuOOtBu as oxidant via copper(I)

&#8208;diketiminato catalysts. Proceeding via alkyl radicals R&#8226;, this method enables &#945;&#8208;substitution with bulky substituents without competing elimination that occurs in more traditional alkylation reactions between enolates and alkyl electrophiles. DFT studies suggest the intermediacy of copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ar) that capture alkyl radicals R&#8226; to give R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar outcompeting dimerization of the copper(II) enolate to give the 1,4&#8208;diketone ArC(O)CH2CH2C(O)Ar.

         <title>Polysilaketals: High&#8208;Performance Polyether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Tunable Disubstituted Silane Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating silyl groups into the backbone of polyethylene oxide (PEO), the leading polymer electrolyte, via the novel anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals yielded a series of polysilaketals [P(OSiR&#8217;,R&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;2EO)] with varying steric bulk. They display competitive electrochemical properties, including the first example of a solid polymer electrolyte with higher conductivity than PEO. Moreover, unlike PEO, the amorphous nature of these polymers facilitates low temperature applications.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes exhibit higher energy density and improved safety in lithium&#8208;ion batteries relative to traditionally used liquid electrolytes but are currently limited by their lower electrochemical performance. Aiming to access polymer electrolytes with competitive electrochemical properties, we developed the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals to synthesize amorphous silicon&#8208;containing polyether&#8208;based electrolytes with varying substituent bulk of the general formula [OSi(R)2(CH2CH2O)2]n (R=alkyl, phenyl). As opposed to previously reported uncontrolled polycondensation routes toward low molecular weight polysilaketals, AROP allows access to targeted molecular weights above the entanglement threshold of the polymers. The polysilaketal with the lowest steric bulk (P(OSiMe,Me&#8208;2EO)) exceeds the conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a leading polymer electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solid polymer electrolyte to achieve this benchmark. Steric bulk in polysilaketals was found to impart stability and two bulkier polysilaketals, P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) and P(OSiMe,Ph&#8208;2EO), exhibited higher current fractions than PEO over a wide range of salt loadings. Moreover, the efficacy of P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) was competitive with that of PEO. Taken together, the tunable and competitive electrochemical properties of polysilaketals validate the systematic incorporation of silyl groups as a strategy to access high performance polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene was selectively converted into a valuable gasoline component, achieving yields of up to 73.3&#8201;% with a 90.1&#8201;% proportion of branched alkanes over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The synergistic coupling between sulfate groups and Lewis acid sites (Zr sites) enhances polyethylene activation, while weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites regulate the reaction pathway to favor branched alkane production.heterogeneous catalysisbranched alkanesplastic upcyclingpolyethyleneacid sites







Abstract
Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8211;C13) with yield of 73.3&#8201;% over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1&#8201;% within the C4&#8211;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two substrates, tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine, are used in parallel by Cinchona to generate the naturally occurring mixtures of methoxy and non&#8208;methoxy Cinchona alkaloids. Discovery of the genes responsible for methoxylation allows reconstitution of biosynthetic intermediates in tobacco.







Abstract
Quinine is a historically important natural product containing a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.

         <title>Twisted&#8208;Planar Molecular Engineering with Sonication&#8208;Induced J&#8208;Aggregation To Design Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregates for Enhanced Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted&#8208;planar molecular design together with a sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation strategy has been used to develop MTSIC J&#8208;aggregates, with the absorption red&#8208;shifting from 620&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. MTSIC undergoes kinetic assembly from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and eventually to stable J&#8208;aggregates. MTSIC J&#8208;dots showed enhanced fluorescence as well as photodynamic and photothermal effects for cancer phototherapy.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, redshifting the absorption from 624&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8211;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.

         <title>Iodine Boosted Fluoro&#8208;Organic Borate Electrolytes Enabling Fluent Ion&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative electrolyte formulation for rechargeable magnesium batteries, addressing the challenges of complex synthesis and magnesium anode passivation seen in traditional boron&#8208;based salts. By combining tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), the system evolves into Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 upon contact with the Mg anode. This results in a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enhancing Mg plating and stripping efficiency. Our proposed synthetic reaction and in situ formation of SEI later also has universality for other B(OR)3, where R represents different F substitution. This formulation exhibits superior electrochemical performance, low overpotential, and long cycling life, outperforming previous boron&#8208;based electrolytes.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based organic magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF=fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability and oxidative stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg metal anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent, which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80&#8197;mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500&#8197;h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Chevrel&#8208;phase Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes, with the overarching goal of establishing favorable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases that are pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.

         <title>An Interstitial Boron Inserted Metastable Hexagonal Rh Nanocrystal for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing metastable phase structure plays an important role in changing the physicochemical properties and improving the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the synthesis of metastable phase metallic nanocrystals is highly challenging, mainly due to the thermodynamically unstable ground&#8208;state. Here, we report a synthesis of unconventional metastable hexagonal rhodium nanocrystal (Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C) via interstitial boron insertion. The insertion of boron atoms into the interstitial sites of cubic Rh lattice not only induces the atomic arrangements from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), but also stabilizes the metastable hexagonal Rh structure. Benefiting from the phase transition and interstitial boron doping, the Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.413 mA &#956;gPGM&#8208;1. Experimental measurements including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strengthened adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface of Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C is responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and increased water proportions in the gap region in the electric double layers. As a result, the increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network facilitate high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen transfer across the interface, thereby boost the alkaline HOR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dihydroazete Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fischer carbenes have recently found great utility in the construction of degradable metathesis materials, but investigations have been limited to oxygen&#8208;containing enol ether monomers. Here, the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes is reported. The polymerization proceeds regioselectivity, and the resulting molecular weights are targetable by adjusting the Grubbs initiator loading. Under acidic conditions, the resulting polymers degrade into 3&#8208;aminopropanal derivatives through hydrolysis of the recurring enamide motifs in the polymer backbone. Additionally, the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics of the polymerization were studied through DFT calculations to elucidate the origins of metathesis regioselectivity. This work further expands the suite of monomers available to generate degradable metathesis materials and provides a flexible platform for target applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Cordycicadin D and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;Cordycicadins A and B: Entry to the 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;Fused Cordycicadin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:

Lost in post&#8208;translation. Cordycicadins A&#8211;D are four C20&#160;polyketides, all containing a&#160;g&#8208;lactone&#160;fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unknown. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B. The targets were convergently assembled, in a biomimetic fashion,&#160;via&#160;an efficient ketene trapping&#8208;intramolecular Michael addition sequence that delivered the requisite 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;fused framework with high diastereoselectivity, enabled by the synthesis of complex dioxenones that serve as&#160;in situ&#160;ketene precursors. Recognition of the embedded polyketide symmetry enabled the use of a divergent&#8208;convergent synthetic&#160;strategy, based on the use of two products from an early&#8208;stage enzymatic resolution. The synthetic routes afforded (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D in 14 steps and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B in 13 steps (longest linear sequence). This work confirms the structure of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the observed instability of the anticipated natural product 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadin B during purification may explain why it is yet to be isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Rotaxane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers as Relays in Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by&#160;the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Pioneering  Built&#8208;in Interfacial Electric Field for Enhanced Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we develop a nano&#8208;heterostructure composed of ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells over Ni3N nanoparticles (Ni3N@W5N4) as efficient catalysts, in which built&#8208;in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is created owing to the distinct lattice arrangements and work functions of biphasic metal nitrides. The BIEF facilitates the electron localization around the interface and enables high valence W and more exposed binding sites in the surface W5N4 shell for accelerating the water dissociation step, ultimately leading to a remarkable reduction in the energy barriers of RDS from 1.40 eV to 0.26 eV. Theoretical calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis results demonstrated that surface W5N4 serves as the active species for HER. Moreover, the ultra&#8208;thin shell characteristics enable the optimized W5N4 with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity to be fully exposed as active sites. Consequently, the Ni3N@W5N4 exhibits exceptional performance in alkaline HER (60 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2) and remarkable long&#8208;term stability (500 mA cm&#8208;2 for 100 hours). When employed as the cathode in the AEMWE device, the synthesized Ni3N@W5N4 demonstrates stable performance for over 80 hours at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Applications of an Amide Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linchpin reagents are building blocks that can be chemoselectively functionalized to afford products with a common, useful functional group. In this work, we describe the development and validation of the first amide linchpin reagent and demonstrate its use as a doubly electrophilic building block for the synthesis of a variety of amides, including challenging classes. The linchpin reagent was first functionalized via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination. Selected masked C&#8208;isocyanate products were then further derivatized with Grignard reagents to produce secondary amides, or tertiary amides if an alkylating agent was added subsequently. The success of this sequence relies on fully controlled reactivity at each electrophilic site, first exploiting the weak N&#8208;O bond and then, the ability to form the free isocyanate intermediate in situ. The overall transformation proceeds with high chemoselectivity, demonstrating the ability of this new linchpin reagent to form amides through atypical bond construction. Finally, the potential of this reagent as a more broadly applicable NCO linchpin is demonstrated by the formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling shows unequivocally the distribution of active species in fresh and hydrothermally aged Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites during NH3&#8208;assisted selective catalytic reduction of NOx. Four principal species co&#8208;exist: (i) CuI cations coordinated to NH3, (ii) CuI cations coordinated to the zeolite framework, (iii) solvated CuII cations, and (iv) framework&#8208;coordinated CuII species (CuIIst) formed upon hydrothermal ageing of the zeolite sample. The CuIIst species were only observed in the hydrothermally aged zeolite samples and are formed upon the interaction of hydrated CuII cations with extra&#8208;framework Al generated during the hydrothermal treatment. These sites are inactive for NOx reduction, leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the hydrothermally aged zeolites. CuIIst formation was higher in Cu&#8208;CHA (~46%) than in Cu&#8208;AEI (~28%). The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI framework is attributed to the tortuous channel structure of AEI that hinders the migration of hydrated CuII cations during hydrothermal ageing.</dc:description>

         <title>Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is a key method used to prepare optically pure compounds in 100% theoretical yield starting from racemic substrates by combining the interconversion of substrate enantiomers with an enantioselective transformation. Various chemoenzymatic DKR approaches have been developed to deracemize secondary alcohols, typically requiring an organic solvent to facilitate enantioselective acylation, primarily catalyzed by lipases, alongside racemization mediated by an achiral, non&#8208;enzymatic catalyst. Achieving both steps in an aqueous solution remained elusive. Here, we report a DKR of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous solution requiring only two biocatalysts. The first key to success was to achieve fast racemization in a buffer employing a non&#8208;stereoselective variant of alcohol dehydrogenase (Lk&#8208;ADH&#8208;Prince) via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence. Engineered variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) enabled enantioselective acyl transfer in water. Besides the appropriate choice of the enzymes, identifying a suitable acyl donor was a second key to the success. The DKR was successfully demonstrated using (R)&#8208;selective MsAcT variants for a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols using 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acetate as the acyl donor, yielding (R)&#8208;acetates with up to &gt;99% conv. and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (83&#8211;99.9% ee). The (S)&#8208;acetates were accessible using a stereocomplementary (S)&#8208;selective MsAcT variant.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly presents a remarkable approach for creating intricate structures by positioning nanomaterials in precise locations, with control over molecular interactions. For example, material arrays with interplanar distances similar to the wavelength of light can generate structural color through complex interactions like scattering, diffraction, and interference. Moreover, enzymes, plasmonic nanoparticles, and luminescent materials organized in periodic lattices are envisioned to create functional materials with various applications. Focusing on structural DNA nanotechnology, here, we summarized the recent developments of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional lattices made purely from DNA nanostructures. We review DNA&#8208;based monomer design for different lattices, guest molecule assembly, and inorganic material coating techniques and discuss their functional properties and potential applications in photonic crystals, nanoelectronics, and bioengineering as well as future challenges and perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Chiral Separation Based on Alkali&#8208;proof Protein Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral separation plays a pivotal role in both practical applications and industrial productions. However, traditional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) exhibit inherent instability in alkaline environments, presenting a significant challenge despite their importance. Herein, basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based CSPs that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. An in&#8208;depth theoretical simulation is conducted to unveil the unique three&#8208;dimensional conformation of alcalase, showing selective affinity towards various enantiomers of chiral amino acids and drugs, especially acidic substrates. Subsequently, an in situ assembly strategy is used to immobilize alcalase within a hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platform. The generated protein&#8208;based CSPs enable successful baseline separation (resolution &#8805; 1.50) for various value&#8208;added compounds (e.g., non&#8208;steroidal drug, RS&#8208;flurbiprofen; nucleotide analog, RS&#8208;tenofovir) via high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, surpassing the commercial chiral column. Furthermore, a systematic study reveals that increasing hydrophilicity and pore sizes of COFs can enhance the separation performance. Remarkably, the obtained CSPs demonstrated exceptional durability, maintaining performance for &gt;2,400 runs. This study provides a new membrane to the protein library for CSPs, and represents an innovative and effective platform for CSPs with immense potential for the enantioseparation of acidic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atomic Cu&#8211;C3 Sites Catalyzed Interfacial Chemistry in Bi@C for Ultra&#8211;Stable and Ultrafast Sodium&#8211;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C3 site (Bi@SA Cu&#8211;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8211;C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8211;F and C&#8211;O bonds in NaPF6&#8211;ether&#8211;based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8211;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8211;C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in&#8211;plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu&#8211;C achieves a state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long&#8211;term cycling durability. The as&#8211;constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351 mAh g&#8722;1 corresponding to an energy density of 265 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new strategy to realize high&#8211;efficient sodium ion storage for alloy&#8211;based anode through constructing single&#8211;atom modulator integrated catalysis and promotion effect into one entity.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation towards the formation of synthetic coacervate droplets represents a rapidly advancing frontier in the fields of synthetic biology, material science, and biomedicine. These artificial constructures mimic the biophysical principles and dynamic features of natural biomolecular condensates that are pivotal for cellular regulation and organization. Via adapting biological concepts, synthetic condensates with dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provide crucial insights into the fundamental cell processes and regulation of complex biological pathways. They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life&#8208;like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.</dc:description>

They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell-like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life-like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shielding Fluoride Ion Basicity through Diurea Coordination for Nonaqueous Fluoride Shuttle Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental nucleophilic attack on organic components in the electrolytes, such as &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination reactions with organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into corrosive and unstable bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. These reactions significantly constrain the choice of suitable solvents and salts to develop electro(chemical) stable fluoride ion electrolytes. In this work, we replaced the triple water ligands typically present in industrial&#160;organic fluoride salts with dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) coordination via hydrogen bonding interaction. This modification successfully suppressed the Lewis basicity of fluoride ions, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability (over 1000 hours) across&#160;a wide range of aprotic solvents, a broadened electrochemical stability window (&#8208;2.5 ~ 0.9 V vs. Ag+/Ag) and high ionic conductivity (1.7 mS cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. Additionally, the weaker hydrogen bonding in F&#8722;&#8208;DPU coordination, compared to the conventional boron&#8208;based anion acceptor (AA) strategy that relies on intensive Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitates faster (de)fluorination kinetics&#160;at the electrode. The proposed room temperature fluoride ion batteries sustain improved electrochemical performance by pairing with the Pb&#8208;PbF2 anode and BiF3 or Ag cathode.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enable the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Stereotactic Anchoring and Spatial Separation of Porphyrins for Amplified Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is pivotal in specifically inducing pyroptosis of tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of pyroptosis is generally hindered by the constraints of ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) was rationally designed via an innovative dual&#8208;solvent strategy to amplify ROS generation for ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis. The crystal structure of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF was elucidated by continuous rotation electron diffraction technique, revealing its regular and rigid conformation. The porphyrin molecules were precisely oriented and firmly confined within the scaffold, effectively restricting intramolecular motion. The ample distance of 6.8 &#197; between two porphyrin molecules confirmed the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in the Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF framework, thereby avoiding the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Furthermore, the permanent porosity and expansive surface area of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF enhanced its interaction with oxygen. These ingenious structural features endowed Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with a unique ability to generate a large amount of singlet oxygen under ultrasound activation. Meanwhile, the impetus of ultrasound also accelerated the rate of the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions, significantly boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the dual amplification of ROS, Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF could efficiently induce tumor cells pyroptosis under ultrasound stimulation, thereby intensifying the potency of cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) delivers small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to enhance radiotherapy. CMOL@siRNAs not only increases energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation, but also effectively delivers an siRNA cocktail to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. CMOL@siRNAs plus X&#8208;ray irradiation shows remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models.







Abstract
Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9&#8201;% and 91.4&#8201;% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TOC illustrates an approach to hydrogen release using low&#8208;load Pt on ALD&#8208;TiO2&#8208;modified &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 pellets for the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), such as methylcyclohexane and hydrogenated biphenyl/diphenylmethane mixture. The cost&#8208;efficient catalytic reactor is crucial for LOHC import scenarios, enabling effective hydrogen storage, release and transport within existing infrastructure.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a perovskite quantum dot (QD)&#8208;dye system for efficient energy transfer (ET) from QDs to dyes occurring via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type interaction, at minimal donor&#8208;acceptor spectral overlap. Dyes containing a dimethyl iminium binding group as part of their conjugated system are chosen for high binding affinity to QD surface, crucial for donor&#8208;acceptor spatial wavefunction overlap for efficient ET.







Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes to CsPbBr3 surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications, such as lighting.

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>

         <dc:description>
Connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene, through an acetylene bridge has been shown to increase the cumulene character in one&#8208;dimensional acetylene&#8208;based conjugates. Spectroscopic analysis and calculations indicate significant &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization during the low temperature&#8208;promoted planarization of the conjugates, which in turn enhances the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge.







Abstract
Acetylene/polyynes &#8722;(C&#8801;C&#8722;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.

         <title>Hydrogenating Polyethylene Terephthalate into Degradable Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and degradability in mildly acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil.







Abstract
The recycling and upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester plastic globally, has attracted growing attention concerning its disposal as non&#8208;degradable waste in the natural environment. Transforming end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET into (bio)degradable polyester offers a novel approach to managing its waste. In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. Pronounced depolymerization would occur with deeper hydrogenation, which generates a blend of PET&#8208;PECHD and polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) with lower Mw, and finally a single&#8208;type polymer PECHD. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and (bio)degradability in acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil. This research highlights the potential for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production of degradable polyester from real&#8208;life plastic waste.

         <title>Co&#8208;Feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;Supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst effectively facilitates co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran aromatization reactions, preferring the dehydro&#8208;aromatization pathways based on cyclopentenones and alkenes over those based on benzofurans. Additionally, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 enhance the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke.







Abstract
Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97&#8201;%, generating &gt;85&#8201;% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05&#8201;%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3&#8201;% to 8.6&#8201;%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic molecular baskets are biocompatible cavitands capable of including toxic methotrexate (MTX) in their aromatic cavity. The binding is chemoselective with the complex forming in competitive cell media. With the unique mode of recognition and modular structure, dendritic baskets are leading candidates for developing effective antidotes against MTX poisoning.

We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8722;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8722; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8722;) in water (Kd=9.2&#8197;&#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8722; folds inside 612&#8722; (&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8722; selectively binds MTX2&#8722; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50&gt;150&#8197;&#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8722; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8722; as dihydrofolate reductase's affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8722;. Nonetheless, considering the basket's biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.

&lt;p&gt;Dendritic molecular baskets are biocompatible cavitands capable of including toxic methotrexate (MTX) in their aromatic cavity. The binding is chemoselective with the complex forming in competitive cell media. With the unique mode of recognition and modular structure, dendritic baskets are leading candidates for developing effective antidotes against MTX poisoning.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18 eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Scenario for a Carbon&#8208;Neutral Ammonia&#8208;Fueled Engine Mediated by Catalytic NH3&#160;Cracking and CO2&#160;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing near zero&#8208;carbon NH3 as fuel in engines is promising for carbon&#8208;neutrality. However, the application of NH3 into the engine suffers from the intrinsic poor combustion characteristics of NH3 and the emission of harmful NOx exhausts. Herein, we proposed and successfully confirmed a novel scenario for converting a conventional "CH4&#8208;fueled"&#160;engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 was used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust. Afterwards, we put forward two routes to convert the exhaust and NH3 into N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle. The first "spatially decoupled"&#160;route splits the exhaust treatment into NH3 cracking over Ru clusters on the calcined Mg&#8208;Al hydrotalcite (Ru/MAO) and CO2 methanation over a commercial Ni/Al2O3. Both NH3 and CO2 were almost completely converted into the target products under their respective optimal conditions. The second &#8220;spatially coupled&#8221; route refers to an one&#8208;pot reaction of NH3 and CO2 into N2, CH4, and H2O. Due to the mismatch of reaction conditions and the competitive adsorption of reactants, the conversions of NH3 and CO2 were lowered to 80.1% and 49.3%, respectively, over Ru/MAO under 1 bar (CO2:NH3 = 3:8) at 550 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Peptide&#8208;derived Proteolysis&#8208;targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Nanoparticles for Tumor&#8208;targeted and Durable PD&#8208;L1 Degradation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8 nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8208;L1 to form PD&#8208;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8208;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8208;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC NPs to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen radical enabling industrial&#8208;level oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and water, powered by renewable electricity, provides a highly attractive alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive autoxidation process presently used in industry, but much remains unknown about this two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR), especially the local proton effect. Here, we have investigated the function of hydrogen&#8208;associated intermediates in the 2e&#8208;ORR using a rationally designed cooperative electrode material with cobalt (II) clusters embedded onto the oxidized carbon nanotube composites (Co&#8208;OCNT). We found that the local proton availability can determine both the reaction kinetics and selectivity. A 2e&#8208;ORR process involving hydrogen radical transfer is confirmed. Specifically, the carbon sites from the OCNTs promote proton production, and the cobalt sites from the Co cluster facilitate ORR intermediate formation. The high local proton availability and the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites both contribute to the superior reaction kinetics and selectivity of the Co&#8208;OCNT, reaching an H2O2 production rate of ~13.4 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 90% at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Further cascading the 2e&#8208;ORR with the electro&#8208;Fenton process shows a high selectivity of oxalic acid up to 97% for the valorization of ethylene glycol.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Formate Ester Transfer Hydrogenation Enables an Electrochemical/Thermal Organometallic Cascade for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy-dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low-temperature and -pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H-PNP)Ir(H)3 (H-PNP = HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of physical parameters correlated with the performance constitutes a fundamental step for the discovery of catalytic materials. Through a cooperative approach between rigorous experiments and AI, we identify a descriptor for the activity of perovskites in CO oxidation that depends on a parameter reflecting crystallographic distortions as well as on the elemental properties of A and B.







Abstract
The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217;=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) perovskites.

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinel oxide, Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen is developed by high&#8208;throughput methods. The lattice oxygen activation is facilitated by Cr oxidation (Cr3+&#8594;Cr6+), accompanied by cation migration from octahedral to tetrahedral sites. This geometric conversion generates oxygen non&#8208;bonding states essential for lattice oxygen oxidation. Oxidized oxygen species are stabilized through dimerization with CrO4 tetrahedra (d0 Cr6+). The oxide demonstrates high activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with outstanding stability for over 170&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8722;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in&#8208;plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C with shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds also favors the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~720&#8197;h of continuous cycling.

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II) Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework confined mono bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species is highly efficient for selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis. This heterogeneous and recyclable single&#8208;site nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane to afford methylboronic acid pinacol ester (CH3Bpin) in 98&#8201;% selectivity with a turnover number up to 1388.







Abstract
We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8722;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment with NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61&#8201;% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8722;Ni catalyst, its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.

The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bpin in 61&#8201;% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape-selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8722;Ni catalyst, its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl-nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover-limiting &#963;-bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF-based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanoprobes with Tunable Exchange Coupling for High Resolution and Sensitive Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers with the exchange coupling facilitate high resolution and sensitive magnetic particle imaging. At equivalent mass concentrations, bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers show a 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieves a resolution of 1&#8197;mm compared to conventional tracers like VivoTrax. The excellent MPI performance contributes to the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice.







Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has demonstrated versatile applications in biomedicine, including tumor imaging, cell tracking, and image&#8208;guided hyperthermia. Despite these advancements, the prevalent use of clinically approved tracers has posed limitations on MPI&#8242;s resolution and sensitivity. In this study, we engineered a bimagnetic core/shell nanocrystals (BMCS) tailored for MPI by optimizing the heterostructure and modulating the exchange coupling effect between the two magnetic components. The resulting BMCS exhibited remarkably heightened susceptibility and magnetization while maintaining low coercivity, thereby substantially improved both MPI resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional tracers such as VivoTrax. At an equivalent mass concentration, BMCS demonstrated a notable 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieved an unprecedentedly high resolution down to 1&#8197;mm. The excellent MPI performance contributes to high resolution MPI and the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. The design strategy employed in BMCS, centered on the exchange coupling effect, introduces an efficacious approach for the development of high performance MPI tracers.

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier Lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tunable intraband defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir in WO3&#8211;x/In2S3 S&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions, effectively prolonging charge carrier lifetime through rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons. Furthermore, it unlocks the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, facilitating H2O photooxidation and thereby boosting CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Alternating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroarene for Efficient Photothermal Conversion via Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, is designed and synthesized for efficient photothermal conversion. With features including mixed D&#8208;A interactions, local aromaticity, self&#8208;absorption, and narrow bandgap, it optimizes non&#8208;radiative decay, achieving high photothermal efficiency and therapeutic capabilities against tumors. Unlike traditional twisted structures, this ladder&#8208;type fused heteroarene design offers a promising molecular engineering approach for advancing organic phototheranostic agents.







Abstract
The development of novel ladder&#8208;type conjugated molecules is crucial for advancing supramolecular chemistry and material science. In this study, we report a straightforward synthesis of new alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, and demonstrate its application as photothermal agent for imaging and cancer therapy. FCDTDPP is constructed by vinylene bridge between cyclopentadithiophene (D) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (A) through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts type reaction. FCDTDPP exhibits unique combination of good molecular planarity, efficient intra&#8208;/intermolecular mixed D&#8208;A interactions, and local aromaticity. These features collectively contribute to its broad and intense absorptions with narrow band gap in red band of the spectra, coupled with multiple vibrational absorption feature, thereby enhancing non&#8208;radiative decay process and resulting in efficient photothermal conversion property. FCDTDPP and its nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior photothermal conversion performance and stability under 660&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that FCDTDPP NPs possess excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and robust photothermal therapeutic efficacy, a finding further corroborated by preliminary in vivo experiments in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work charts a novel course for the molecular engineering of organic photothermal conversion systems, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes to yield E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes was catalyzed by a Pd6L4 octahedral cage, with the solvent judiciously modulating the reaction, thereby unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity of the product. The dispersed metal&#8208;organic cage and the solid&#8208;state cage halted the reaction at its intermediate stage, while the aggregated supramolecular cage expedited the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization process within the confined hydrophobic nanospace.







Abstract
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking the off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8211;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.

         <title>Generation of Bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron Enolates from Alkynes and Their Catalyst&#8208;Free Alkyne Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct comprising tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] and 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide reacts with alkynes to generate bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates. The strong Lewis acidity of these boron enolates facilitates the coupling reaction with various unactivated alkynes, resulting in the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one pot.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are powerful synthetic tools for constructing organic molecular frameworks. In this study, strongly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates were generated from alkynes through oxygen transfer from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide using tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. Boron enolates were highly reactive owing to the strong Lewis acidity of the boron centers, and thus immediately coupled with alkynes. N&#8208;Ethynylphthalimide reacted as an alkyne with 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide and B(C6F5)3 to form a semi&#8208;stable bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolate through the coordination of the carbonyl group to the boron center. This enolate underwent coupling with another alkyne.

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional kirigami mechanics of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) in the solid state are demonstrated through mechanical and molecular stimuli. By controlling these external stimuli, the molecular framework of the ZIF undergoes significant changes, with up to a 37&#8201;% alteration in unit&#8208;cell parameters. This unique folding behavior also leads to programmable pore structures in this channel&#8208;type ZIF, functioning similarly to check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifolds to regulate fluid flow.







Abstract
Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.

         <title>Upcycling Iron Oxide Scale Slag into a High&#8208;Performance, Sustainable Ozone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Iron oxide scale slag by creating a compact junction between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases, their synergistic effect could be harnessed by inhibiting passivation of the Fe2O3 surface and enhancing the catalytic conversion of the adsorbed O3 on the Fe3O4 surface, thus reducing catalyst deactivation and improving the treatment ability of practical antibiotic wastewater (after 2&#8197;h treatment, COD removal rate 81.7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70&#8201;% Fe2O3 and 40.30&#8201;% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70&#8201;% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.

Utilizing a synergistic &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral&#8208;locking strategy, we constructed a high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;based pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF emitter via a lithium&#8208;free synthetic approach. The associated device achieved narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74), a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15&#8197;nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer&#8208;free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% at maximum and 31.8&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxometalate constrained strategy was proposed to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanoclusters by premixing [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The obtained BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can effectively drive the co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 in the presence of O2/Ar/N2 to achieve a record urea yield in the mixed atmosphere.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8722; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33&#8201;% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8722; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2.

     alt="Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polyoxometalate constrained strategy was proposed to prepare ultrafine BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters by premixing [V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101-Al (MIL) framework. The obtained BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@MIL-n can effectively drive the co-reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to achieve a record urea yield in the mixed atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy-intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster by pre-incorporating [V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101-Al (MIL) framework. The resulting &lt;b&gt;BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@MIL-n&lt;/b&gt; can efficiently drive co-reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixed gases (33&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group can enrich CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster can reduce both NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster within a NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction was reported for the first time, which achieves the superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. The abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and the significantly improved the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability induced by the enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields should be the crucial factors.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.28&#8197;times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24&#8197;times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;Chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective photooxidation of commodity and postconsumer polyolefins to produce materials with in&#8208;chain ketones without using catalysts or expensive oxidants. Under mild conditions, yields reached up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones, improving adhesion compared to unfunctionalized plastics. These ketones enable reaction with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks, upcycling mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non&#8208;model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.







Abstract
Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Tailored EDL Induced Triple&#8208;Layer SEI on High&#8208;Capacity Anodes Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Durable Sodium&#8208;Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A dense thin triple&#8208;layer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (inner: Se, mediate: inorganic, outer: organic) is formed on Se&#8208;FeS2 anode via Sex2&#8722; anion&#8208;tailored electric double layer in NaCF3SO3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures lower ion transport barrier and greatly suppresses the electrolyte substantial consumption. The Se&#8208;FeS2 enables high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life at fast&#8208;charging mode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se&#8208;solubility induced Sex2&#8722; as self&#8208;adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple&#8208;layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high&#8208;capacity FeS2 anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Sex2&#8722; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se0 as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2&#8722; causes anion&#8208;enhanced Na+ solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple&#8208;layer SEI with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long&#8208;lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se&#8208;induced triple&#8208;layer SEI could be also be formed on high&#8208;capacity SnS2 anode. This work provides a novel SEI model by anion&#8208;tailored EDL towards stable sodium&#8208;storage of high&#8208;capacity anode for fast&#8208;charging.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se-solubility induced Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as self-adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple-layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high-capacity FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; causes anion-enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple-layer SEI with layer-by-layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long-lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se-induced triple-layer SEI could be also be formed on high-capacity SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode. This work provides a novel SEI model by anion-tailored EDL towards stable sodium-storage of high-capacity anode for fast-charging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;throughput screening, natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) was identified as a novel STING antagonist. A concise and scalable total synthesis was accomplished in 6&#8197;steps based on an efficient acid&#8208;promoted tandem deprotection/cyclization reaction to build the pentacyclic structure. Enabled by total synthesis, the therapeutic potential of ATS was elucidated, which lays the foundation for developing an STING antagonist as an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases.







Abstract
Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6&#8197;steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS's mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients. ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Chiral 2&#8208;Azetines and Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Allenes Via Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective syntheses of fascinating stable chiral 2&#8208;azetines and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes were achieved through phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines.







Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98&#8201;% yields and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water at rt for 2&#8197;minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90&#8201;% yields and up to 91&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically chiral dimeric molecules can achieve high chirality transfer efficiency when co&#8208;assembled with monomeric counterparts or inorganic nanomaterials, regardless of their packing structures. This process enables the fabrication of chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties, which are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8208;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a mechanocatalytic route for upcycling polyethylene (PE) into high&#8208;purity hydrogen gas (H2, 99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) and metal carbides using ball milling at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Manganese (Mn) catalysts enable a remarkable H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;%. The resulting carbides, which do not promote hydrocarbons formation, further enhance H2 recovery ratio. This method provides an efficient pathway for converting PE to high&#8208;purity H2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75&#8197;vol&#8201;% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;% (versus 15.7&#8201;% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains non&#8208;blinking until it binds to HaloTag, thereby initiating its spontaneous blinking activity and facilitating its use in live cell SMLM imaging without wash&#8208;out steps. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo is successfully employed in imaging various intracellular structures at the nanoscale, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter &#8220;RDC&#8221; to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol Based on a Molecule/Nanocarbon Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable, homogeneous active sites offered by CoPc molecule own suitable binding strength to the reactant and key intermediates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway. A hybrid photothermal catalyst, which features carbon nanotube anchored CoPc molecules, realizes a near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity due to the synergistic interaction between intrinsically&#8208;efficient CoPc active sites and CNT photothermal supports for affording an optimal reaction temperature.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of ~99&#8201;% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8208;790 nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450 nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8208;30.7%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Neuromorphic Nanofluidic Sense Digitalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic memristors have recently been reshaped into artificial synapses capable of mimicking many fundamental neurosynaptic patterns, while sense digitalization has been increasingly explored to link the neuromorphic devices with external equipment. By inspiration of dopaminergic nerve, here a nanofluidic nerve with sense digitalization is devised by engineering a dopamine (DA)&#8208;specific nanofluidic synapse as mediated by PC&#8208;12 cells to manage the robotic arm. Different from previous neuromorphic perception of DA via redox reaction, the aptamer&#8208;based perception here is based on biological DA recognition by its receptor as indicated by the ionic signals. Various neurosynaptic patterns are emulated with DA&#8208;dependent plasticity, based on which the digital representation of DA perception is used to control the robotic arm.</dc:description>

         <title>A C156 Molecular Nanocarbon: Planar/Rippled Nanosheets Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel hybrid nanocarbon consisting of one rippled and two planar nanosheets has been synthesized and characterized. Two meso pairs of [5]helicenes are formed along the long molecular axis of the hybrid to connect rippled and planar subunits, leading to a stable conformation. It is shown that the hybrid possesses the individual electronic properties of the rippled and planar subunits. Compared to the rippled subunit, such hybrid has a better geometric match to C60 and complexes with C60 in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with the association constant on the order of 105 M&#8208;1. The hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission. The transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the singlet fission (SF) from higher level singlet excited states (Sn) is operative in the film of the hybrid.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Properties of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide Supramolecular Copolymers through Engineered Coupled Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P Metathesis &#8208; A Direct Route to Structurally Constrained, Cationic PIII Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound [LP][SbCl4] with an OCO pincer&#8208;type ligand (L) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction between PCl3 and LSb&#8208;Cl. [LP][SbCl4] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH2) was studied, showing that [SbCl4]&#8211; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [SbCl4]&#8211; was replaced with the [CB11H12]&#8211; ([Cb]&#8211;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [LP]+ cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E = O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P&#8208;center and products of the P&#8208;center/ligand&#8208;assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [LP]+ activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Meta&#8208;Dimethylation of Arenes via Catellani Reaction from Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts that allows selective functionalization of the meta position of arenes. The combination of a site&#8208;selective thianthrenation with a Catellani reaction provides access to 3,5&#8208;dimethylated arenes. The developed reaction is complementary to the previously discovered reductive ipso&#8208;alkylation of aryl thianthrenium salts and extends the possibilities for late&#8208;stage methylation of arenes with a single aryl thianthrenium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Methionine Incorporation into Cyclophilin A by Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis for 19F NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;19 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. Of particular interest is the exploitation of trifluoromethyl (tfm) groups, given their high sensitivity and superior transverse relaxation properties, compared to single fluorine atoms. However, biosynthetic incorporation of tfm&#8208;bearing amino acids remains challenging due to cytotoxicity and incompatibility with natural tRNA synthetases. Here, we report on overcoming this challenge using cell&#8208;free synthesis, incorporating trifluoromethyl&#8208;methionine (tfmM) into the protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) with remarkably high efficiency, impossible via biosynthetic means. Importantly, we demonstrate that tfmM CypA binds a native substrate, the N&#8208;terminal domain of HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (HIV&#8208;1 CA&#8208;NTD), and retains peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. It also binds the peptide inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) with the same affinity as non&#8208;labeled, wild&#8208;type CypA. Furthermore, we show that 19F isotope shifts and 19F solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) provide valuable structural information on surface exposure. Taken together, our study illustrates that tfmM can readily be incorporated into proteins at very high levels by cell&#8208;free synthesis without disturbing protein structure and function, significantly expanding the scope of 19F NMR spectroscopy for studying protein structure and dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Emulsions for Smart Structures with Multiple Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D printing, and more recently 4D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology for fabricating structures with complex geometries and responsive properties. However, employing functional colloidal solutions as inks for printing remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel and versatile 4D printing approach for fabricating functional and complex&#8208;shaped objects using polymerizable liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets. Leveraging a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique, we achieve rapid production of intricate 3D geometries with high resolution. The printed structures retain the LC ordering from the precursor droplets, imparting the final objects with shape memory properties, including shape fixation and recovery upon heating or light exposure. Light&#8208;responsive behavior is introduced post&#8208;printing by embedding an azo dye into the 3D structures. Additionally, we explore the potential to create intrinsically porous 3D structures by selectively removing non&#8208;reactive components from the printed geometries, adding an extra level of functionality to the printed objects. Furthermore, we incorporate chiral nematic LCs into the emulsion droplets, producing 3D objects with tunable reflective properties. To our knowledge, this is the first example of DLP 3D printing with emulsions, offering an effective and versatile pathway for developing 4D&#8208;printed materials with potential applications in optics, robotics, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G &gt; 0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1 eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, Tloss (the peak of loss modulus (E&#8221;)) and Tg (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long&#8208;lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53 MPa, tensile strain of 497%, Young&#8217;s modulus of 782 MPa, toughness of 111.2 MJ/m3, and lifetime of 113.05 ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257 K or 347 K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Low&#8208;Concentration Electroreduction of NO to NH3 via Potential&#8208;Controlled Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as effective active sites for enhancing the low&#8208;concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes&#160;potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over VO&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x&#160;to enhance NORR performance. Combining constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results demonstrate that applying&#160;external potentials&#160;promote&#160;the formation of Ti3+ active sites and alter&#160;its spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with Faradaic efficiency of 76.4% and&#160;NH3 yield rate of 632.9 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 under 1.0 vol% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with&#160; reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10 vol%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record&#8208;breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as effective active sites for enhancing the low-concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes&#160;potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over VO-TiO2-x&#160;to enhance NORR performance. Combining constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results demonstrate that applying&#160;external potentials&#160;promote&#160;the formation of Ti3+ active sites and alter&#160;its spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO-to-NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO-TiO2-x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with Faradaic efficiency of 76.4% and&#160;NH3 yield rate of 632.9 &#956;g h-1 mgcat.-1 under 1.0 vol% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with&#160; reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10 vol%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record-breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7 &#956;g h-1 mgcat.-1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymeric Iodine Transport Layer Enabled High Areal Capacity Dual Plating Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine cathode in aqueous battery has drawn great attention due to its high energy density and high safety. However, iodine has extremely low conductivity of 1&#215;10&#8208;7 S cm&#8208;1, which usually results in low specific capacity. In this work, a PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer was designed to enhance the areal capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine cell. The areal capacity of PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer modified CNT cathode showed twice as higher capacity than that of pure CNT film in a dual&#8208;plating cell, The significant enhancement of the capacity was attributed to the fast iodine transport in the PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer. Besides, the strong interaction between PVA chain and polyiodide anions prevented the shuttle effect. The PVA modified CNT cathode could stably operate for over 3000 hours with remarkably higher capacity and cycle life. We analyzed the uniquely fast transport behavior of polyiodides in PVA hydrogel by in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ optical micrography, as well as DFT calculations. It was found that the strong binding force together with lower dissociation energy of iodine on PVA chain is the dominate reason for reduced shuttle effect and fast polyiodide transport. As a result, the assembled PVA&#8208;I2 pouch cells showed excellent performance in both dual&#8208;plating cells and conventional&#8208;type cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Screened d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Turing Structure of Confined Nickel for Sulfion Oxidation Accelerated Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy&#8208;efficient and tech&#8208;economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM&#8208;S2&#8208; d&#8208;p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d&#8208;p orbit hybridization between TM and S2&#8208; by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p&#8208;p orbit coupling between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8208; enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8208;2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67 V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p&#8208;band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two&#8208;electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1 Acm&#8208;2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91 V while maintaining stability for over 300 hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32 kgh&#8208;1m&#8208;2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Hubbard Gap Closure&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Redox Li&#8208;Storage Mechanism as the Origin of Anomalously High Capacity and Fast Ion Diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;Like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POMs) electrodes&#160;have already emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the origins of the underlying redox mechanism in such materials remain a matter of uncertainty. Of critical challenges are the anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values and the fast ion diffusivity that cannot be satisfactorily comprehended in the theory of crystal lattice. Herein, for the first time we decode t2g electron occupation&#8208;regulated dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism as the true origin of extra capacity in POMs electrodes. &#160;Enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation by Li coordination significantly triggers the Hubbard gap closure and reversible Li deposition/dissolution at surface region. Conjugated V&#8208;O&#8208;Li configuration at interlayers endow Li+ ion pathways along pore walls as the dominant contribution to the low migration barrier and fast diffusivity. As a result, remarkable cycle stability (~100 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1), extremely high specific capacity (1200 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (404 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 A g&#8722;1) were achieved, providing new understandings on the underlying mechanism of POMs electrodes and pivotal guidance for dual&#8208;storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Buried Interface for Efficient SAM&#8208;based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) anchored on metal oxides (MO) have greatly boosted the performance of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by serving as hole&#8208;selective contacts due to their distinct advantages in transparency, hole&#8208;selectivity, passivation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and processing efficiency. While the intrinsic monolayer nature of SAMs provides unique advantages, it also makes them highly sensitive to external pressure, posing a significant challenge for long&#8208;term device stability. At present, the stability issue of SAM&#8208;based PVSCs is gradually attracting attention. In this review, we discuss the fundamental stability issues arising from the structural characteristics, operating mechanisms, and roles of SAMs, and highlight representative works on improving their stability. We identify the buried interface stability concerns in three key aspects: 1) SAM/MO interface, 2) SAM inner layer, and 3) SAM/perovskite interface, corresponding to the anchoring group, linker group, and terminal group in the SAMs, respectively. Finally, we have proposed potential strategies for achieving excellent stability in SAM&#8208;based buried interfaces, particularly for large&#8208;scale and flexible applications. We believe this review will deepen understanding of the relationship between SAM structure and their device performance, thereby facilitating the design of novel SAMs and advancing their eventual commercialization in high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted PVSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Functionalization of Arenes with Vinyl Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral tetrasubstituted alkenes are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related areas. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains elusive, due to the high steric repulsion and relatively low conformational stability. Herein, we disclose the straightforward construction of atropisomeric tetrasubstituted alkenes via an effective enantiocontrol of vinyl cations. This copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8211;H functionalization of sterically hindered (hetero)arenes with vinyl cations enables the efficient and atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted styrenes and pyrrolyl ethylenes with high atroposelectivities. Importantly, this reaction represents the first example for the assembly of axially chiral alkenes through vinyl cation approach. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the reaction mechanism, origin of regioselectivity, Z/E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by diverse product derivatizations, chiral organocatalyst synthesis, as well as further applications in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d&#8208;band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed, Regio&#8208;/Stereo&#8208; and Enantiospecific Anti&#8208;Carboxylation of Unactivated Internal Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes enabled via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol. The acetate ligand of the palladium catalyst controls the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in the desired transformation. The potential of this concept has been demonstrated by the development of the chiral version of this transformation by using axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer with good yields and enantioselectivities. Detailed investigations, including kinetic studies, order studies, and DFT studies, were performed to validate the ligand&#8208;assisted nucleopalladation process and the rationale behind the observed racemization of chiral allenes. The studies also indicated that the anti&#8208;carboxypalladation step was the rate&#8208;limiting as well as the stereo&#8208; and enantiodetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitrile Derived Lithium Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross&#8208;coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross&#8208;coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo&#8208;unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom&#8208;stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (N&#8208;stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp3)&#8208;CF2R bonds, previously challenging in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430 J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterizations of Dibenzo&#8208;Fused Perioctacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and unambiguously characterized by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR analysis indicated the closed&#8208;shell character of DBPO, yet an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal was observed at room temperature suggesting its potential open&#8208;shell diradicaloid nature. The bond lengths in the single&#8208;crystal structure of DBPO aligned more closely with those of open&#8208;shell teranthene than closed&#8208;shell bisanthene. Spin&#8208;unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using various methods supported that ground state of DBPO might be on the borderline between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;shell singlet states, with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), consistent with the VT&#8208;NMR and EPR results. UV&#8208;vis&#8208;near infrared (NIR) absorption spectrum showed the longest&#8208;wavelength peak at 905 nm, marking the NIR optical properties of DBPO. DBPO exhibited a tendency to react with atmospheric oxygen, which additionally hinted at its possible open&#8208;shell character. Furthermore, the oxidized species of non&#8208;fluorescent DBPO exhibited strong emission at 820 and 915 nm, which opens its potential for oxygen detection via a "turn&#8208;on" NIR fluorescence response.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a highly diastereoselective protocol for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds from densely substituted cyclopropanols. The methodology involves a palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening reaction followed by a &#8220;metal&#8208;walk&#8221; and oxidation of a remote hydroxyl group. The methodology represents a new application of cyclopropanols as initiation sites for chain walking remote functionalization. Importantly, this approach provides a straightforward access to highly valuable succinaldehyde derivatives bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters as single diastereomers.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Maleimide&#8208;Based Dual Functionalization of Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maleimide derivatives are privileged reagents for chemically modifying proteins through the Michael addition reaction with cysteine due to their selectivity, operational simplicity, and commercial availability. However, since accessible free cysteine is rarely found in natural proteins, it is highly desirable to find alternative targets to enable direct bioconjugation of proteins with maleimides. In this study, we have developed an operationally simple and straightforward method for the N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins without the need for mutagenesis via a copper(II)&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides and 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PCA) derivatives under non&#8208;denaturing conditions at pH 6 and 37 &#176;C in aqueous media. Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross&#8208;linked at the N&#8208;termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well&#8208;defined structures in a wide range of research fields.</dc:description>

Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N-terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross-linked at the N-termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2-positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8211;Cy5&#8211;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2-positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well-defined structures in a wide range of research fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hexafluorophosphate&#8208;Triggered Hydrogen Isotope Exchange (HIE) in Fluorinated Environments: A Platform for the Deuteration of Aromatic Compounds via Strong Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a perpetual need for efficient and mild methods to integrate deuterium atoms into carbon frameworks through late&#8208;stage modifications. We have developed a simple and highly effective synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in aromatic compounds under ambient conditions. This method utilizes catalytic amounts of hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8722;) in deuterated 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1) and D2O. Phenols, anilines, anisoles, and heterocyclic compounds were converted with high yields and excellent deuterium incorporations, which allows for the synthesis of a wide range of deuterated aromatic compounds. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that an interactive H&#8208;bonding network triggered by HFIP&#8208;d1 activates the typically inert P&#8208;F bond in PF6&#8208; for D2O addition. The thus in&#8208;situ formed DPO2F2 triggers then HIE, offering a new way to deuterated building blocks, drugs, and natural&#8208;product derivatives with high deuterium incorporation via the activation of strong bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Nonenzymatic Formation of Biologically Common RNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic formation of RNA building blocks is well&#8208;supported experimentally, yet the emergence of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;specific RNA oligomers is generally attributed to biological selection via Darwinian evolution rather than prebiotic chemical selectivity. In this study, we investigated the partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products via these two competing pathways using deep sequencing. Comprehensive sequence&#8208;reactivity profiles revealed that loop&#8208;closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (where N represents A, C, G, or U) under both loose and stringent competing conditions. In contrast, splinted ligation products favor CG&#8208;rich overhangs. Notably, the overhang sequences that preferentially partition to loop&#8208;closing ligation significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops, whereas the overhangs favoring splinted ligation exhibit an inverse correlation with biological tetraloops. These sequence rules enable the high&#8208;efficiency assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs free from template inhibition. Our findings suggest that the RNA tetraloop structures that are common in biology may have been predisposed and prevalent in the prebiotic pool of RNAs, prior to the advent of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that the one&#8208;step prebiotic chemical process of loop&#8208;closing ligation could have favored the emergence of the first RNA functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta&#8208;C&#8208;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8208;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation, meta&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;based directing group, in conjunction with aryl boronic acids, selectively promotes meta&#8208;arylation with complete mono&#8208;selectivity. Despite significant advancements in meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, etc., meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, 5&#8208;phenyl valeric acid, 6&#8208;phenylcaproic acid, 3&#8208;phenylpropanol, and 4&#8208;phenylbutanol underwent meta&#8208;arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows for the production of biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the meta&#8208;position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8208;450&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9% at 240&#176;C and 1000 mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#176;C and 4000 mL/g/h with more than 25% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500 hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296 K and 1 bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31 cm&#179;/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt; 99.5%) of 184 mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8211;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>How Carbene Ligands Transform AuAg Alloy Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have attracted increasing interest for their special structures and diverse applications. However, developing synthetic strategies and extending the database of NHC&#8208;protected nanoclusters are still challenging tasks. In this work, a novel and rapid synthetic method is developed to prepare AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene based on the reactivity of nanoclusters. The rod&#8208;like carbene&#8208;capped bimetal nanocluster, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6 (Au13Ag12:BMIm), was achieved and characterized by a series of techniques. The alloy nanocluster consists of two vertex&#8208;sharing icosahedrons and carbene ligands, phosphine ligands, and I atoms. Interestingly, the introduced carbene ligands show strong coordination capabilities with Au, enhancing the interaction between metal core and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, the carbene&#8208;capped Au13Ag12:BMIm nanocluster is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light compared with the homogeneously capped analogue nanocluster ([Au13Ag12(PPh3)10I8]SbF6). Density functional theory calculations attribute these properties to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. Finally, the Au13Ag12:BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, achieving a urea production rate of 29.5 mmol gcat&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 34% at &#8208;0.5 V (vs. RHE).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible zeolite membranes are promising for scalable and adaptable separation of critical gases such as helium; however, the synthesis of such membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of crack&#8208;free ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports using a seeded growth method. PTFE&#8208;supported membranes exhibit unprecedented helium permeance of over 6.7&#215;10&#8208;7 mol m&#8208;2 s&#8208;1 Pa&#8208;1 and high He/N2 and He/CH4 separation factors of 17 and 83 respectively, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. These flexible membranes maintain excellent separation performance even after bending and stretching. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale membranes demonstrate stable helium separation from multicomponent gas mixtures, showcasing their significant potential for practical helium extraction from natural gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinctive Photomechanical Shape Change of p&#8208;Phenylenediacrylic Acid Dimethyl Ester Single Crystals Induced By Spatially Heterogeneous Photoreaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p&#8208;PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p&#8208;PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction. These results prove that the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction dynamics have the ability to induce novel crystal shape changes beyond what would be expected based on the equilibrium reactant and product crystal shapes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally convenient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step hydrosilylation/hydroboration reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access racemic 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes. In addition, the corresponding asymmetric reaction is developed with a chiral copper catalyst to prepare 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high enantioselectivity by a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure. Mechanistic studies reveal that this difunctionalization process begins with metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of arylidenecyclopropanes to generate homoallylsilane intermediates, followed by regio&#8208; or enantioselective metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of homoallylsilanes to produce skipped borylsilylalkanes. Selective transformations of C&#8211;B and Si&#8211;H bonds in skipped borylsilylalkane products are also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Photochemical Post&#8208;Processing of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals carry a great potential as new soft smart materials, with a plethora of recent examples overcoming the major obstacle of mechanical flexibility, and this research direction holds enormous potential to revolutionize optics, electronics, medicine, and space exploration. However, shaping organic crystals into desired shapes and sizes remains a major practical challenge due to the lack of control over the crystallization process, and the difficulties in mechanical post&#8208;processing without introduction of defects that are usually imparted by their soft nature. Here we present an innovative approach that employs photochemical processing for precise and nondestructive cutting of a molecular crystal. Our proposed method uses light to post&#8208;process crystals of the desired size and shape, similar to using light to cut other materials. This reaction induces strain, ensuring sharp cleavage without the need for melting or other processes. We further demonstrate the potential of this approach by producing crystals of arbitrary size, which can be used as controllable optical waveguides. Among other potential applications, this method can be used to prepare dynamic crystals, particularly those with aspect ratios crucial for mechanical deformation, such as flexible electronics, soft robotics, and sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Transfer Mediator Modulates Type II Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Photosensitizers for Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive and effective local treatment, heavily depends on photosensitizer (PS) performance and oxygen availability. Despite the use of PS&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to address the solubility and aggregation issues of PSs, the inherent hypoxic intolerance of mainstream Type II PDT remains challenging. Herein, we report an electron transfer strategy for the fabrication of hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I MOFs by encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) into existing Type II MOFs. With TQ serving as an effective electron transfer mediator, it facilitates the electron transfer process from the MOF ligand PS to oxygen, establishing the Type I pathway and attenuating the original Type II pathway. Four representative porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are synthesized to demonstrate the proposed strategy. Our findings reveal that TQ@MOF&#8208;1 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit enhanced anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions and superior in vivo antitumor efficacy compared to parent MOF&#8208;1 NPs. This work offers an effective and universal strategy to modulate ROS generation in PS&#8208;based MOFs, endowing hypoxic tolerance with improved PDT performance against solid tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni(II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand&#8217;s electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Aziridines: Enhancing Polysulfides for Superior Mechanical Strength and Adhesive Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel approach to inverse vulcanization by utilizing a commercially available triaziridine crosslinker as an alternative to conventional olefin&#8208;based crosslinkers. The model reactions reveal a self&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of "unactivated" aziridine with elemental sulfur, forming oligosulfide&#8208;functionalized diamines. The triaziridine&#8208;derived polysulfides exhibit impressive mechanical properties, achieving a maximum stress of ~8.3 MPa and an elongation at break of ~107%. The incorporation of silicon dioxide (20 wt%) enhances the composite&#8217;s rigidity, yielding a Young's modulus of ~0.94 GPa. Furthermore, these polysulfides display excellent adhesion strength on various substrates, such as aluminum (~7.0 MPa), walnut (~9.6 MPa), and steel (~11.0 MPa), with substantial retention of adhesion strength (~3.3 MPa on steel) at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The straightforward synthetic process, combined with the accessibility of the triaziridine crosslinker, emphasizes the potential for further innovations in sulfur polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin&#8208;derived guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds into methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols through oxidative ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation reactions catalyzed by novel fungal polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is presented. The formation of o&#8208;diphenols rather than reactive quinones can be steered by the addition of a reductant. These PPOs offer new methods to reduce the heterogeneity of G and S lignin&#8208;derived product mixtures.







Abstract
The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Oxidative (ortho&#8722;) demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs by a distinct reaction mechanism as compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a novel photocatalytic system for the synthesis of glycine directly from methanol and nitrate. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles show a high glycine photosynthesis rate under mild conditions. The success of this work provides a sustainable pathway for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste.







Abstract
Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we develop an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8722;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8722;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8208;Urey experiments.

Exchanging a sulfur atom against a methine group in a series of azaacene based diradicals furnishes non&#8208;Kekul&#233;, meta&#8208;quinodimethane based diradicals with singlet ground states and small singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Zwitterionic contributions are ruled out experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically, and the diradicals display huge two&#8208;photon cross sections in the infrared spectral region.







Abstract
Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; quinoidal azaacences m&#8208;A (1&#8201;a,b) were synthesized and compared to their para&#8208; and ortho&#8208;quinodimethane analogues. m&#8208;A display high diradical characters (1&#8201;b: y0 = 0.88) due to their meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) topology. Electron paramagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and supraquantum interference device measurements in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed singlet ground states for m&#8208;A with singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST (0.13&#8211;0.25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and thermally populated triplet states. These non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structures are over all void of zwitterionic character and possess record high two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small heterostructures (AuNCs@OFTF) with amphiphilicity were developed. They can be rapidly internalized in cyanobacteria and provide a programmable electronic interface, where the strong energetic coupling accelerates electron transfer in living cyanobacteria. Exogenous photogenerated electrons from AuNCs@OFTF enable a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent and enhance biomass production of cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNCs@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNCs@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNCs@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNCs@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNCs@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloadditions of Bicyclobutanes with Imines: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc Lewis acid catalyzes asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines to afford aza&#8208;BCHs bearing &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers in high yields and er values. Expeirmental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds&#8212;Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles via hydroborative cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds is reported. Structurally diverse products, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more were readily obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed an interesting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon, including &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles was studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.

         <title>Peptide Degrader&#8208;Based Targeting of METTL3/14 Improves Immunotherapy Response in Cutaneous Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study unveils METTL3&#8217;s oncogenic role in melanoma. RM3, a designed peptide inhibitor disrupting METTL3/14 complex, induces proteasomal degradation via STUB1. RM3 reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, RM3 elicits significantly enhanced tumor response in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.







Abstract
METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.

Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase &lt;b&gt;RM3&lt;/b&gt;, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (s=&gt;100 in &gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.







Abstract
The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)&#8208;, C(4)&#8208; and C(5)&#8208;, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (s) typically &gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The application of this KR method to tertiary alcohols derived directly from a natural product (geraniol), alongside pharmaceutically relevant drug compounds (indomethacin, gemfibrozil and probenecid), with high efficiency (s &gt;100) is also described. The KR process is readily amenable to scale up using bench grade solvents and reagents, with effective resolution on a 50&#8197;g (0.22&#8197;mol) scale demonstrated. The key structural motif leading to excellent selectivity in this KR process has been probed through computation, with an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction from substrate to acylated catalyst observed within the favoured transition state. Similarly, the effect of C(5)&#8208;aryl substitution that leads to reduced experimental selectivity is probed, with a competitive &#960;&#8211;isothiouronium interaction identified as leading to reduced selectivity.

         <title>Simultaneously Strengthening and Toughening All&#8208;Natural Structural Materials via 3D Nanofiber Network Interfacial Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial interlocking structure is designed by introducing protonated chitosan (CS) at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose (BC). This interfacial structure provides enough physical contact sites for hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The obtained structural material shows better environmental friendliness and mechanical and thermal properties than engineering plastics.







Abstract
Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding combining excellent mechanical and thermal properties, especially the balance of strength and toughness. Here, we report a 3D nanofiber network interfacial design strategy to strengthen and toughen all&#8208;natural structural materials simultaneously. The introduced protonated chitosan at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose forms the interfacial interlocking structure of nanonetworks, achieving a robust physical connection and providing enough physical contact sites for chemical crosslinking. The obtained sustainable structural material successfully integrates excellent mechanical and thermal properties on the nanoscale of cellulose nanofibers, such as light weight, high strength, and superior thermal expansion coefficient. The relationship between structural design and comprehensive mechanical property improvement is analyzed in detail, providing a universal perspective to design sustainable high&#8208;performance structural materials from nanoscale building blocks.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids, characterized by non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchors, are developed and used as hole&#8208;extraction layers in organic solar cells. Such simple and tailorable backbones offer a novel platform to study structural effect on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on ITO, which leads to an impressive performance of 19.66&#8201;% owing to optimized interfacial contact and active layer morphology.







Abstract
Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

A putative &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the functional characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel photoactive azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) shows an excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than its corresponding imine&#8208;linked 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), although only one atom is different in the two 2D COFs (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;). COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits much narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity, which is benefited from its azo linkages.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8722;N=N&#8722; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>

A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability with a superior energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 even under the harsh cycling conditions.







Abstract
Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability (2700&#8197;cycles) with exceptional anti&#8208;pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO4 cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200&#8197;cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01&#8201;% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive&#8208;capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on facile pathway for scalable production of durable thin Li metal anode toward reliable practicability.

         <title>Multifunctional Modification of the Buried Interface in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all&#8208;perovskite tandems.







Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates is presented. By connecting the aromatic systems of the macrocycles via 5&#8208;membered rings under standard Scholl conditions, the formation of highly soluble and stable &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins is achieved. The described planarization led to significant alterations regarding the photophysical and optoelectronic characteristics of the molecules.







Abstract
A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.

         <title>S&#8722;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

RuSx/NbS2 heterostructure was synthesized by the introducing of amorphous RuSx onto crystalline NbS2 surface. It shows a Pt&#8208;like HER activity with a low overpotential as 38&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is mainly benefit from hydrogen spillover caused by reversing charge transfer that induced by S&#8722;S bonds at RuSx/NbS2 heterointerface.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.







Abstract
Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmon&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmon hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9&#8201;%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>

A commercially available ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) was used to deposit palladium, demonstrating excellent performance in photocatalysis and thermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reactions under various pre&#8208;treatment conditions.







Abstract
Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250&#8201;&#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar): 7.46&#8197;molmethanol&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &gt;99&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.

         <title>The Fate of the Formic Acid Proton on the Anatase TiO2(101) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High vacuum FTIR experiments at temperatures as low as 13&#8197;K, together with divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that a short and strong hydrogen bond is formed during the adsorption of HCOOH on the anatase (101) TiO2 surface. Such unusual H&#8208;bond has previously escaped direct spectral detection because of a huge red shift of its vibrational frequency.







Abstract
As a prototype adsorption reaction of gas Br&#248;nsted acid on oxides, we study the adsorption of formic acid on anatase. We perform infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed HCOOH and HCOOD on TiO2 nanopowders, from 13&#8197;K up to room temperature in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum chamber. We assign the IR signals via computed spectra from nuclear quantum dynamics simulations using our divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics method. The acid proton forms an extraordinarily short and strong hydrogen bond with the surface oxygen. The strength of this hydrogen bond, that compares to H bonds in ice at high pressures, is at the root of a substantial redshift with respect to the typical free OH stretching frequency, which eludes its straightforward detection.

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydronium cation (H3O+) was found to be critical to regulating the observed behaviors of IrO2 during acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The H3O+ cation induced an internal electric field at the interface, enabling selective bond&#8208;tuning to the reaction intermediates. As a result, 0.5&#8197;monolayer of *OH species was stabilized under OER operational condition, and the overall conversion was revealed to be hindered by *OH&#8594;*O.







Abstract
The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O&#8594;*OOH to *OH&#8594;*O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site-selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergistic tuning of lattice magnetic fields and interfacial structure stability, this work provides a green, efficient, and universal strategy of Si gradient doping to overcome the kinetic hysteresis problems that have long&#8208;term hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.







Abstract
Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8722;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8722;xSi0.01O2, 0.6&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of UDP&#8208;Glycosyltransferases for Synthesizing Triterpenoid Glycosides with a Linear Trisaccharide as Aided by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferase UGT91H enzymes for the regioselective 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids to generate triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide are described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to expand the substrate scope of UGT91H enzymes, and an RTAS loop was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H enzymes.







Abstract
Triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The glycosylation of triterpenoids catalyzed by UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is a crucial method for producing valuable derivatives with enhanced functions. However, only a few UDP&#8208;glucosyltransferases have been reported to synthesize the rare triterpenoids with linear&#8208;chain trisaccharide at C3&#8722;OH. This study revealed that the UGT91H subfamily primarily contributed to the 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids with high regioselectivity, then the substrate scope was further expanded by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). With ancestral enzyme UGT91H_A1 as a model, the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function relationship was explored. A RTAS loop (R212/T213/A214/S215) was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H_A1. Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low&#8208;cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self&#8208;sufficient UDP&#8208;rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny&#8208;based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases.

UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low-cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self-sufficient UDP-rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny-based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP-glycosyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component vinylene&#8208;linked D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with reinforced intramolecular charge separation driving force was designed and prepared, achieving highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation efficiency and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The Cu&#8208;CTUs active sites can effectively adsorb and activate CO2 to further enhance photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Intramolecular charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1) by integrating benzyl cyanides linker with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) moieties, featuring with strong intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites. The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation is achieved. Consequently, UJN&#8208;1 exhibits an excellent CO formation rate of 114.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h without any co&#8208;catalysts or sacrificial reagents under visible light, outperforming those analogous MCOFs with imine&#8208;linked (UJN&#8208;2, 28.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and vinylene&#8208;linked COF without Cu&#8208;CTU active sites (UJN&#8208;3, 50.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), emphasizing the role of charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry in designing novel COFs&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>High Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protonation&#8208;modification strategy has been employed to modify imine&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs), significantly improving the electron delocalization capabilities of the imine bonds and constructing advanced memory devices. The obtained novel COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT@PTSA thin film&#8208;based rewritable memristors exhibit high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105) and unprecedented endurance (more than 1300 number of cycles).







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300&#8197;cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.

         <title>A Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Enhancing Interfacial Stability and Solution Phase Discharge in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on LiTFSI, acetamide and boric acid, improving the oxidation voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V, and enhancing the solution phase discharge mechanism by forming Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds with Li+ and O2&#8722;. The introduction of boric acid also promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, which induces Li+ uniform deposition. The Li&#8722;O2 battery with this DEE delivers ultrahigh discharge capacity, improved cycling performance and intrinsic safety.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs) have gained widespread recognition for their exceptional energy densities. However, a major challenge faced by LOBs is the lack of appropriate electrolytes that can effectively balance reactant transport, interfacial compatibility, and non&#8208;volatility. To address this issue, a novel supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) has been developed, based on synergistic interaction between Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds through a combination of lithium salt (LiTFSI), acetamide (Ace) and boric acid (BA). The incorporation of BA serves as an interface modification additive, acting as both Li&#8208;bonds acceptor and H&#8208;bonds donor/acceptor, thereby enhancing the redox stability of the electrolyte, facilitating a solution phase discharge process and improving compatibility with the Li anode. Our proposed DEE demonstrates a high oxidation voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 15225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance of 196&#8197;cycles in LOBs. Additionally, the intrinsic non&#8208;flammability and successful operation of a Li&#8722;O2 pouch cell indicate promising practical applications of this electrolyte. This research broadens the design possibilities for LOBs electrolytes and provides theoretical insights for future studies.

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces new insights into the heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth dynamics that directly influence the performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). It reveals that high&#8208;performance electrodes for LMAs, characterized by a high active lithium adsorption capacity and fast surface diffusion kinetics, can be defined as &#8242;supersaturated electrodes.







Abstract
The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.

The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to construct nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with accurately tailored biphasic interfaces. Using Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures as a model catalyst for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, this work establishes a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of the catalyst.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8211;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5&#8208;minute temporal resolution by using regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.







Abstract
The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure was constructed. The heterostructure provides dual&#8208;sites for carbon dioxide reduction and nitrate reduction reactions, and thus facilitate efficient C&#8722;N coupling toward urea formation. The obtained Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers greatly enhanced urea yield rate and Faradaic efficiency compared with individual Ag and CuNi(OH)2.







Abstract
The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C&#8722;N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1&#8201;%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual&#8208;site catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, considering their role on the interface.

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

We have developed a &#8220;Suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL) approach that serves as a general and economical delivery method to address fundamental biological questions. We applied SBL to investigate the cellular behavior of synthetic Ubiquitin related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1) under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.

We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

         <title>Unlocking the Anion Effect on Steerable Production of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of THF/NaCl aq, which is attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. The anion promotes electron transfer through proximity effects and also induces a decrease in the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension, thereby increasing the HMF yield.







Abstract
Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3 (74.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;AlCl3 (60.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al2(SO4)3 (35.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al(NO3)3 (14.9&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodiophobic graphite can be converted to sodiophilic graphite intercalation compounds through solvated&#8208;sodium&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation mechanisms, thus facilitating dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal plating/stripping with enhanced Coulombic efficiencies. This finding propels the achievement of cost&#8208;effective and high capacity anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries with energy densities of above 250&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6&#8197;V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18&#8197;V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7&#8201;% over 550&#8197;cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C (10&#8197;min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotics against Drug&#8208;Resistant Pathogens Discovered via Host&#8208;Dependent Heterologous Expression of a Cloned Biosynthetic Gene Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambocidins are calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a unique peptide core that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Heterologous expression of their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in multiple hosts resulted in production of new metabolites. However, only one heterologous host was capable of supporting production of the ambocidins. The ambocidins bind lipid II at a site distinct from the target of vancomycin.







Abstract
Historically, small molecules biosynthesised by bacteria have been an excellent source for antibacterial drugs. Today, however, the rediscovery of known compounds is a significant hurdle to developing new antimicrobials. Here we use a genome mining and synthetic biology approach to discover the ambocidins: calcium&#8208;dependent lipodepsipeptides that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. By cloning a silent biosynthetic gene cluster (the amb cluster) from Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 2387 and integrating this into the chromosome of Streptomyces avermitilis we induce expression of ambocidin A and B: two new N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine&#8208;containing cyclic lipodepsipeptides active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using a panel of Streptomyces host strains, we show that the choice of heterologous host is critical for producing the biologically active compounds, and that inappropriate host choice leads to aberrant production inactive derivatives. We show that N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine is the product of a heme&#8208;dependent oxygenase and that it enhances biological activity. Ambocidin A inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to Lipid II at a different site than vancomycin. Furthermore, unlike daptomycin, ambocidin A retains potent antimicrobial activity in the presence of lung surfactant, giving it the potential to treat bacterial pneumonia. Our work expands the family of calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a new member exhibiting a distinct mechanism of action.

After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO4&#8722; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V. Notably, after 5000&#8197;cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, DHTAT retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically L/D&#8208;glutamate&#8208;derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H&#8208;aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.







Abstract
A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report establishes the redox activity of biOx (bi&#8208;oxazoline), biIm (bi&#8208;imidazoline), and pyIm (pyridine&#8208;imidazoline) ligands in stabilizing nickel radical complexes. Direct comparison of the redox potentials of bidentate N&#8208;ligands provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.







Abstract
Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular Homo&#8208;couplings, but especially Cross&#8208;couplings are challenging! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo&#8208; and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.







Abstract
We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.

         <title>Molecular Design of Hole Transport Materials to Immobilize Ion Motion for Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA&#8208;SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent T80 lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.







Abstract
Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (T95=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene with organic azides yields stable CAAC&#8208;iminoborane adducts. Experimental and computational data confirm the involvement of a relatively long&#8208;lived terminal borylene&#8208;dinitrogen adduct (i.e. diazoborane), [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)] as a key intermediate in the reaction.







Abstract
While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.

         <title>Ferroptosis Inducing Co(III) Polypyridine Sulfasalazine Complex for Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting ferroptosis provides a novel avenue to overcome the limitations of apoptotic anticancer treatments. The Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex described here acts as a potent ferroptosis inducer for anticancer therapy. This complex selectively accumulates in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species, initiating lipid peroxidation, depleting glutathione, inhibiting glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4, and ultimately driving ferroptosis.







Abstract
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of cancerous tumors in the last decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. To overcome the shortcomings of currently applied chemotherapeutic treatments, much research efforts have been devoted towards the development of ferroptosis inducing anticancer agents. Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death that is associated with high potential inside the clinics. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of a Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex as a ferroptosis inducer is reported. Upon entering the cancerous cells, the metal complex primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, triggering the production of hydroxy radicals and lipid peroxides, ultimately causing cell death by ferroptosis. The compound demonstrated to eradicate various monolayer cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroids. To the best of our knowledge this study reports on the first example of a Co(III) complex that is capable of inducing ferroptosis.

An earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst enabled efficient electrochemical recycling of post&#8208;consumer polystyrene with molecular hydrogen as the sole by&#8208;product, highlighting its potential for a circular carbon economy with a scalable green hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants POS or NEG were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.







Abstract
Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen.

     alt="Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants &lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;NEG&lt;/b&gt; were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co-workers introduced visible light sensitization of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with horizontal ionic transport channels (H&#8208;MXene) to withstand extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions, significantly outperforms that with vertical ionic transport channels (V&#8208;MXene) in ion selectivity and permeability, achieving a current density over three orders of magnitude higher without significant polarization, an osmotic power density of 9.47&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.

This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well&#8208;designed donor&#8208;acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox&#8208;active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi&#8208;electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;] trithiophene (BTT) as p&#8208;type and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) as n&#8208;type material (BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 275&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte) and outstanding rate capability (79&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte). In addition, the potential of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF electrode for prototype batteries has been demonstrated by full cells of dual&#8208;ion (FDIBs), which attain comparable electrochemical performances to the half cells. Moreover, mechanism studies combining ex situ characterization and theoratical calculations reveal the efficient dual&#8208;ion storage process and facile charge transfer of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF. This work not only expands the diversity of redox&#8208;active COFs but also provide concept of structure design for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity organic electrodes.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [18F][Gd(FL1)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative in vivo mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel&#8208;based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [18F][Gd(FL1)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI).

Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling. It is designed to facilitate the one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons to chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.







Abstract
Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>

Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>

Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

The Janus bifunctionality of Pd nanoparticles or atoms encapsulated in a Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework is reported by Magnus Rueping, Pedro Casta&#241;o et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409490). As illustrated in the cover picture, on one side the catalyst is active and selective in photo&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;couplings, and on the other side selective and stable in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol.

         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular living polymers with strongly coupled, delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge&#8208;transfer excitations (CTE) were developed by Jianlei Han, Shigenori Fujikawa, and Nobuo Kimizuka in their Research Article (e202410431). Suitably designed, chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) show spontaneous transformation from kinetically formed nanoparticles into thermodynamically stable, luminescent helical and tubular nanostructures with enhanced chiroptical properties, fluorescence quantum yields, and living polymerization characteristics.

A novel hybrid PET/MRI probe integrating stable gadolinium chelate with radioactive fluorine&#8208;18 was designed for precision imaging of perfusion and excretion dynamics. In their Research Article (e202409520), Andr&#233; F. Martins, Miloslav Polasek et&#8197;al. demonstrate how merging quantitative PET signal with MRI contrast within a single molecule improves diagnostic capabilities. Employing sophisticated image analysis, this innovative probe can reveal hidden health issues, such as early stages of kidney dysfunction.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409526), the presence of hydronium cation (H3O+) introduces an internal electric field at the interface. It allows selective bond&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediates and formation of partial surface hydroxylation under the operational conditions, which actively catalyzed the OER.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis: &#916;&#916;G&#8800; versus Enantiomeric Excess</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the difference between enantiomeric excess (ee) and relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;) as modeling targets in asymmetric catalysis. Through data analysis and application of modern machine learning methods, we unveil the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our results offer critical insights into which target more accurately predicts enantioselectivity, providing a guide for future research in machine learning for catalysis.







Abstract
With the rise of machine learning (ML), the modeling of chemical systems has reached a new era and has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and predict chemical reactions. Here, we probe the historic dependence on utilizing enantiomeric excess (ee) as a target variable and discuss the benefits of using relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;), grounded firmly in transition&#8208;state theory, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists. This perspective is intended to discuss best practices that enhance modeling efforts especially for chemists with an experimental background in asymmetric catalysis that wish to explore modelling of their data. We outline the enhanced modeling performance using &#916;&#916;G&#8800;, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non&#8208;linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types. We evaluated the datasets using fingerprint&#8208;, descriptor&#8208;, and graph neural network&#8208;based models. Our results highlight the distinction in performance among varying model complexities with respect to the target representation, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists.

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography.

     alt="Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon-based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano-sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD-based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high-quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomole Scale Screening of Fluorescent RNA&#8208;Methyltransferase Probes Enables the Discovery of METTL1 Inhibitors</title>

A nanomole&#8208;scale modular synthesis approach enables the rapid development of fluorescent RNA MTase probes, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screenings for drug development. This innovative approach enables advancements in RNA MTase medicinal chemistry highlighted by the discovery of METTL1 inhibitors.







Abstract
RNA methylation is a metabolic process validated for its association with various diseases, and thus, RNA methyltransferases (MTases) have become increasingly important in drug discovery. Yet, most frequently utilized RNA MTase assays are limited in their throughput and hamper this rapidly evolving field of medicinal chemistry. In this study, we describe a modular nanomole scale building block system that allowed the identification of tailored fluorescent MTase probes to unlock a broad selection of MTase drug targets for fluorescence&#8208;based binding assays. Probe candidates were initially prepared on a 4 nanomole scale and could be tested directly from crude reaction mixtures to allow rapid probe identification and optimization. Using an alkyne&#8208;azide click late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy and in silico protein databank mining, we established a selection of fluorescent probes suitable for relevant drug targets from the METTL and NSUN families, as well as bacterial and viral MTases. Using this concept, a high&#8208;throughput screening on the unexplored drug target METTL1 discovered three hit compounds with micromolar potency providing a (1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;based starting point for METTL1 drug discovery.

         <title>An Atomic&#8208;Scale Explanation for The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hads travels with the motion of a liquid metal surface, allowing it to reach dopant sites (In or Sn) where it reacts with CO2 to make formate with a low barrier (0.25&#8197;eV). Hads is not mobile on a solid surface, explaining why only liquid metals catalyse the reaction.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn have previously showcased &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid. Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2 does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26&#8197;eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47&#8197;eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2 reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a ternary cluster consisting of a polyoxometalate cluster sandwiched by two gold clusters protected by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes was synthesized through ligand exchange, whose atomically precise structures were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. These composite clusters demonstrate excellent catalytic capabilities for reducing H2O2 via the intercluster synergistic effects.







Abstract
Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster&#8212;a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteomics enabled the measurement of protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome, via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis to an ultra&#8208;high mass range Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based native proteomics agreed well with native mass photometry regarding the mass distribution of detected proteins.







Abstract
Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird's&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis through Microbial Ecosystem Engineering on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial ecosystem engineering enables efficient solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis over a biohybrid photocatalyst. The syntrophic coculture of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) with the electron transport specialist Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400) over carbon nitride produced a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst for the sunlight&#8208;driven methane synthesis from carbon dioxide.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in solar chemistry to drive sustainable chemical reactions.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.

         <title>Abiotic Foldamer Quaternary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hydrogen bond donors at precise locations at the periphery of a stable aromatic foldamer helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix tertiary fold led to its aggregation in chloroform to produce genuine discrete abiotic quaternary structures in which the tertiary folds are preserved. The quaternary structures were assigned to C3&#8208;symmetrical trimer corresponding to the initial design, and to an unexpected hydrated C2&#8208;symmetrical dimer.







Abstract
Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.

         <title>A DNA Polymerase Variant Senses the Epigenetic Marker 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Increased Misincorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase that distinguishes methylated from unmethylated DNA by increased misincorporation opposite 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) during DNA synthesis. By generating 5&#8197;mC&#8208;dependent mutation signatures in the PCR product, the enzyme is able to sense methylated sites and allows direct detection by reading elevated error rates at 5&#8197;mC positions after sequencing without prior conversion of the template DNA.







Abstract
Dysregulation of DNA methylation is associated with human disease, particularly cancer, and the assessment of aberrant methylation patterns holds great promise for clinical diagnostics. However, DNA polymerases do not effectively discriminate between processing 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) and unmethylated cytosine, resulting in the silencing of methylation information during amplification or sequencing. As a result, current detection methods require multi&#8208;step DNA conversion treatments or careful analysis of sequencing data to decipher individual 5&#8197;mC bases. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated 5&#8197;mC detection approach. Here, we describe the engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase variant derived from Thermus aquaticus with altered fidelity towards 5&#8197;mC. Using a screening&#8208;based evolutionary approach, we have identified a DNA polymerase that exhibits increased misincorporation towards 5&#8197;mC during DNA synthesis. This DNA polymerase generates mutation signatures at methylated CpG sites, allowing direct detection of 5&#8197;mC by reading an increased error rate after sequencing without prior treatment of the sample DNA.

         <title>Tricyanomethane or Dicyanoketenimine&#8212;Silylation makes the Difference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me3Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)3. Further silylation with [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3][B(C6F5)4] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe3)3]2+ stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)3]&#8722;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)3, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a pKa value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)3 is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo&#8208; and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me3Si]+ as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)3]&#8722; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)3, namely [Me3Si][C(CN)3], and in presence of two additional [Me3Si]+ cations even the dicationic species [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+ as stable [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)3, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)3]&#8722;, silylation of the [C(CN)3]&#8722; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long&#8208;sought dicyanoketenimine [Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

&lt;p&gt;The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Further silylation with [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo- and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, namely [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si][C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], and in presence of two additional [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations even the dicationic species [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as stable [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, silylation of the [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long-sought dicyanoketenimine [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Unusual (4+3) Annulation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Oxabicyclo[4.1.1]Octanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1.]octanes is demonstrated via the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinone methides with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The reaction proceeds with the simultaneous activation of p&#8208;QMs and BCBs by Lewis acid. Mechanistically, the reaction entails the activation of the ester enolate of BCB by the Lewis acid. This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.







Abstract
Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinonemethides (p&#8208;QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)3, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and p&#8208;QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6&#8208;addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to p&#8208;QMs followed by the C2&#8208;selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a non&#8208;local metasurface to achieve vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between surface lattice resonance and the C=O stretching modes of both ethyl acetate and p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). Within this VSC system, we observed a 2.7&#8208;fold increase in the solvolysis reaction of PNPA compared to the bare reaction. This finding highlights the robustness of metasurfaces in catalyzing chemical reactions via VSC.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.

         <title>Complex Dance of Molecules in the Sky: Choreography of Intermolecular Structure and Dynamics in the Cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O Hetero Ternary Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

&lt;p&gt;This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of C&#8208; and Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silacyclopentanes via Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with dihydrosilanes or primary silanes, which gives access to a variety of C&#8208;stereogenic and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in decent yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silacycles have exhibited significant potential for application in the fields of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Accordingly, the development of effective methods for synthesizing these compounds has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with hydrosilanes, that allows the rapid assembly of various enantioenriched carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions. Further stereospecific transformation of the Si&#8722;H bond on the chiral silicon center expands the diversity of these C&#8208; and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes.
