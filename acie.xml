         <title>An Expanded 2D Fused Aromatic Network with 90&#8208;Ring Hexagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic networks (2D FANs) have emerged as a highly versatile alternative to holey graphene. The synthesis of 2D FANs with increasingly larger lattice dimensions will enable new application perspectives. However, the synthesis of larger analogs is mostly limited by lack of appropriate monomers and methods.&#160;Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterisation and properties of an expanded 2D FAN&#160;with 90&#8208;ring hexagons,&#160;which exceed the largest 2D FAN lattices reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in the mechanistic study of newly developed piezocatalysis systems. The differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the tentative mechanisms of energy band theory and screening charge effect are elaborated. The current challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are provided.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis, a newly emerging catalysis technology that relies on the piezopotential and piezoelectric properties of the catalysts, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism of piezocatalysis is still under debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are highlighted. Hopefully, this Review can help readers gain a better understanding of piezocatalysis and enable its application in their own research.

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Silica/AAO Hybrid Membrane with Enhanced Permselectivity for Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Sensitive Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anode alumina oxide (MCS/AAO) hybrid membrane by interfacial super&#8208;assembly is reported. The MCS/AAO hybrid membrane with enhanced permselectivity exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and superior temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;sensitive salinity gradient energy conversion performance.







Abstract
Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation was obtained by interfacial super&#8208;assembly method. A maximum power density of 5.04&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicting Therapeutic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) is developed for real&#8208;time reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;activated cancer therapy by ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. The nanoplatform can self&#8208;monitor the activation of nanozymes during cancer therapy, which has potential to predict therapeutic effects in vivo and guide nanoenzymes in personalized cancer treatment.







Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application. However, there is a lack of facile approach for evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles, which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM), the catalytic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric signals of NIRF (FL695/FL825) and PA (PA680/PA780), which may provide new ideas for predicting anticancer efficacy of nanozymes in living system.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Templating Growth of Homeostatic GeP Nano&#8208;Bar Corals with Fast Electron&#8208;Ion Transportation Pathways for High Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ template method is proposed to directionally induce the construction of corals of GeP nanobars featuring high aspect ratio, plentiful exposed facets for rapid Li+ transport, and a self&#8208;healable homeostatic ability to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability.







Abstract
We propose an in situ template method to directionally induce the construction of germanium phosphide nanobar (GeP&#8208;nb) corals with an adjustable aspect ratio. The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron&#8208;ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics. The customized GeP&#8208;nb electrode delivers a self&#8208;healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing GeP crystalline structure through multi&#8208;phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles). As a result, the GeP&#8208;nb presents the highest Li+ diffusion coefficient (6.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) among all the Ge&#8208;based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anode.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Difunctionalization of Cyclohexenyl Triflates: Direct Access to Versatile Cyclohexenes via Cyclohexynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates, via strained cyclic alkyne intermediates generated in situ. The importance and utility of this method is exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.







Abstract
Difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkynes presents a powerful strategy to build richly functionalized cyclic alkenes in an expedient fashion. Herein we disclose an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates. We have demonstrated the novel use of zincate base/nucleophile system for effective formation of key cyclohexyne intermediates and selective addition of various carbon and nitrogen nucleophiles. Importantly, leveraging the resulting organozincates enables the incorporation of a broad range of electrophilic partners to deliver structurally diverse cyclohexene motifs. The importance and utility of this method is also exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Cu&#8208;Doped SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n Heterostructure That Shows Significant Raman Enhancement**

         <dc:description>
A sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF &gt;1010. SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was then developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs recorded in a barcode demonstrated practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.







Abstract
Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46&#215;1010. This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework is realized by hierarchical assembly in water. The coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligand to the zinc porphyrin subunits of a monolayer supramolecular network has been utilized to selectively produce ordered bilayer supramolecular architectures with controlled thickness.







Abstract
Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the cooperative coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smallest all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected silver superatom, Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ has an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure. It can adsorb CO2 in the air and exhibits high activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, with FE reaching 95&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. DFT calculations show that the under&#8208;coordinated Ag atom on Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one ligand releasing from the cluster surface is the active species.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that Ag15 possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that Ag15 can adsorb CO2 in the air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into CO with a faradaic efficiency of ca. 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V and a maximal turnover frequency of 6.37&#8197;s&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO formation.

         <title>Heavily Tungsten&#8208;Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
A strategy for modifying the structure of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm. At &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5&#8197;mS/cm. The 30&#8201;% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8211;12&#8201;% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo&#8208;cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na&#8208;ions. An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) using Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 as the primary SSE and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;Polymer Heterostructure with Ordered In&#8208;Plane Mesochannels for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure with ordered in&#8208;plane cylindrical mesochannels. The resultant 2D heterostructure shows top&#8208;level CDI performance in its application as electrode material for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
The application of traditional electrode materials for high&#8208;performance capacitive deionization (CDI) has been persistently limited by their low charge&#8208;storage capacities, excessive co&#8208;ion expulsion and slow salt removal rates. Here we report a bottom&#8208;up approach to the preparation of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure having ordered in&#8208;plane mesochannels (denoted as mPDA/MXene). Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) monolayers on MXene nanosheets leads to the mPDA/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits several unique features: (1)&#8197;MXene undergoes reversible ion intercalation/deintercalation and possesses high conductivity; (2)&#8197;mPDA layers establish redox capacitive characteristics and Na+ selectivity, and also help to prevent self&#8208;stacking and oxidation of MXene; (3)&#8197;in&#8208;plane mesochannels enable the smooth transport of ions at the internal spaces of this stacked 2D material. When applied as an electrode material for CDI, mPDA/MXene nanosheets exhibit top&#8208;level CDI performance and cycling stability compared to those of the so far reported 2D materials. Our study opens an avenue for the rational construction of MXene&#8208;organic hybrid heterostructures, and further motivates the development of high&#8208;performance CDI electrode materials.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Ammonia from Its Elements Down to Atmospheric Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis over Fe catalysts promoted by alkali metals, especially Rb or Cs, is possible under ball milling. The reaction proceeds at appreciable rates at room&#8208;temperature and down to atmospheric pressure in a continuously operating system under gas flow.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis via the high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure Haber&#8208;Bosch process is one of the most important chemical processes in the world. In spite of numerous attempts over the last 100&#8197;years, continuous Haber&#8208;Bosch type ammonia synthesis at room&#8208;temperature had not been possible, yet. We report the development of a mechanocatalytic system operating continuously at room&#8208;temperature and at pressures down to 1&#8197;bar. With optimized experimental conditions, a cesium&#8208;promoted iron catalyst was shown to produce ammonia at concentrations of more than 0.2&#8197;vol.&#8201;% for over 50&#8197;hours.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Poly&#8208;4&#8208;Acrylomorpholine: A Flexible and Reversibly Compressible Aligning Gel for Anisotropic NMR Analysis of Peptides and Small Molecules in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of the solution We synthesized a new anisotropic alignment media, p&#8208;4&#8208;AM, that is compatible with water and reusable. P&#8208;4&#8208;AM was characterized with strychnine hydrochloride as a model compound and used to determine the solution conformation of a cyclic peptide. This alignment media will increase the use of residual dipolar couplings (RDC) in structure&#8208;based drug design by enabling the identification of minor solution conformations in water.







Abstract
Determination of the solution conformation of both small organic molecules and peptides in water remains a substantial hurdle in using NMR solution conformations to guide drug design due to the lack of easy to use alignment media. Herein we report the design of a flexible compressible chemically cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine gel that can be used for the alignment of both small molecules and cyclic peptides in water. To test the new gel, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and J&#8208;coupling constants were used in the configurational analysis of strychnine hydrochloride, a molecule that has been studied extensively in organic solvents as well as a small cyclic peptide that is known to form an &#945;&#8208;helix in water. The conformational ensembles for each molecule with the best fit to the data are reported. Identification of minor conformers in water that cannot easily be determined by conventional NOE measurements will facilitate the use of RDC experiments in structure&#8208;based drug design.

         <title>Atomic Level Insights into Metal Halide Perovskite Materials by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy are powerful techniques to visualize the topographic and electronic structures of metal halide perovskites with atomic&#8208;level resolution. These techniques can also be used to reveal the dynamics of surface defects and charge carriers as well as on&#8208;surface reactions and optoelectronic properties at the surface and interfaces of perovskite materials.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite materials (MHPMs) have attracted significant attention because of their superior optoelectronic properties and versatile applications. The power conversion efficiency of MHPM solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed to 25.5&#8201;%. Although the performance of PSCs is already competitive, several important challenges still need to be solved to realize commercial applications. A thorough understanding of surface atomic structures and structure&#8211;property relationships is at the heart of these remaining issues. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) can be used to characterize the surface properties of MHPMs, which can offer crucial insights into MHPMs at the atomic scale. This Review summarizes recent progress in STM and STS studies on MHPMs, with a focus on the surface properties. We provide understanding from the comparative perspective of several different MHPMs. We also highlight a series of novel phenomena observed by STM and STS. Finally, we outline a few research topics of primary importance for future studies.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) were developed to elicit potent antitumor immunity by concurrently blocking innate immune checkpoint CD47 and adaptive immune checkpoint PD&#8208;L1. The Fus&#8208;CVs represent a simple, safe and robust alternative to fusion proteins for multi&#8208;targeting immune blockade checkpoint (ICB) therapy.







Abstract
Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) displaying high&#8208;affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD&#8208;1 can activate potent antitumor immunity through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Dual&#8208;blockade of CD47 and PD&#8208;L1 with Fus&#8208;CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus&#8208;CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus&#8208;CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus&#8208;CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus&#8208;CVs an attractive platform for multi&#8208;targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

         <title>Directed Regioselective Carbometallation of 1,2&#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation reaction of cyclopropenes is a well&#8208;established method for the synthesis of stereodefined cyclopropanes. All existing reports to date proceeded towards the formation of the electronically more stable organometallic intermediate. Herein we report a regioselective addition to 1,2&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropene possessing a tethered directing group to direct the organometallic species towards the formation of single regioisomer intermediate out of two electronically unbiased possibilities.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation of 1,2&#8208;dialkylated cyclopropenes is reported. The regioselectivity is controlled by a subtle tethered Lewis basic moiety. The chelating moieties allow the differentiation between two electronically tantamount organometallic intermediates. Further functionalization grants access to polysubstituted stereodefined cyclopropanes bearing up to five alkyl groups.

         <title>Multifunctional Deformable Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bendable single crystal of an organic semiconductor is reported that can be used as phototransistor, photoswitch and a waveguide. The material exists as two polymorphs with distinct elastic or plastic mechanical properties and can be switched by heating. The crystals are optically conductive in the near&#8208;infrared and can be used as optical waveguides in the telecommunications range.







Abstract
We report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties that can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. Mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phases being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages. The crystals transmit light in the telecommunications range with significantly low optical loss for an organic crystalline material.

         <title>Multivariate Synergistic Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Superproton Conductivity for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate flexible MOF facilitates efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding formation by synergistic self&#8208;adapting its flexible structure, maintains excellent proton conductivity. Based on compelling proton conductivity, a single&#8208;cell of MOF&#8208;based PEMs with long&#8208;term durability is assembled and exhibits excellent power density, promises doors hopefully for practical application of proton&#8208;conducting MOFs in DMFCs.







Abstract
Improving proton conductivity and fabricating viable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are central issues exploiting electrolyte MOFs. We aim to design multivariate flexibility synergistic strategy to achieve Flexible MOFs (FMOFs) with high conductivity at a wide range of humidity. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and temperature&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT&#8208;IR) prove the synergistic self&#8208;adaption between dynamic torsion of alkyl sulfonic acid and dynamic breathing of FMOF, forming a continuous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks to maintain high conductivity. Based on the convincing proton conductivity, we construct a series of long&#8208;term durable MOF&#8208;based PEMs that serve as a bridge between MOF and fuel cell. Consequently, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of the flexible PMNS1&#8208;40 exhibits a maximum single&#8208;cell power density of 34.76&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and hopefully opens doors to evaluate the practical application of proton&#8208;conducting MOFs in direct methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Divergent Aminocarbonylations of Alkynes Enabled by Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes with amines and 1 atm of CO is reported, offering a novel and complementary platform for accessing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. This synergistic protocol facilitates an unprecedented sequential hydroaminocarbonylation/radical alkylation process with tertiary and secondary alkyl boronate esters.







Abstract
A metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the selective and divergent aminocarbonylation of alkynes with amines and 1 atm of CO is reported. This synergistic protocol not only enables the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, but also facilitates a sequential four&#8208;component hydroaminocarbonylation/radical alkylation in the presence of tertiary and secondary alkyl boronate esters, which allows for straightforward conversion of alkynes into corresponding amides. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that a photoinduced oxidative insertion of aniline and CO into nickel followed by a migratory insertion of (carbamoyl)nickel species could be involved.

Carbene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphorus atoms to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates affords chiral phosphines with potential applications as ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is the first carbene&#8208;organocatalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphine nucleophiles to the in situ generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates. Our reaction enantioselectively constructs carbon&#8211;phosphine bonds and prepares chiral phosphines with high optical purities. The phosphine products are suitable for transforming to chiral ligands or catalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis. The diarylalkyl or trialkyl phosphine products from our catalytic reactions, air&#8208;sensitive and reactive in nature, can be trapped (and stored) in their sulfur&#8208;oxidized form for operational simplicities.

         <title>ROS/RNS and Base Dual Activatable Merocyanine&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Molecular Probe for in vivo Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we developed a ROS/RNS and base dual activatable NIR&#8208;II molecular probe PN910 based on modulating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of a merocyanine fluorophore named Chrodol&#8208;3. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PN910 is a reliable NIR&#8208;II sensor for the non&#8208;invasive specific monitoring of H2O2 and ONOO&#8722; in alkaline tissue.







Abstract
Inflammation usually results in high&#8208;level reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) not only in acidic tissue but also in alkaline tissue. However, noninvasively in vivo monitoring reactive species specifically within alkaline tissue remains a huge challenge. Here we introduce a dual activatable fluorescent probe PN910 located in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8211;1700&#8197;nm), which shows high selectivity toward H2O2 and OONO&#8722; at pH beyond 7.4. Then we verified that PN910 could be used for the real&#8208;time, specific and accurate monitoring of cystitis and colitis for living animals. This report presents a unique approach to the development of dual activatable probe for in vivo biosensing.

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of an Isolable Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pincer scaffold allows the isolation of a nickelacyclobutane and a detailed study of its reactivity. The cycle slowly undergoes an apparent beta&#8208;elimination reaction in non&#8208;polar solvents; exposure to additional ligands lead to selective ring cleavage along either the cyclopropanation or the olefin metathesis pathway. These results give insight into the divergent reactivity of metallacyclobutane intermediates.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are mostly invoked as reactive intermediates in the reaction of nickel carbenes and olefins to yield cyclopropanes. Nevertheless, early work suggested that other decomposition routes such as &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and even metathesis could be accessible. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of a stable pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane incorporated in a pincer complex. The coordination of different coligands to the nickelacyclobutane determines its selective decomposition along cyclopropanation, metathesis or apparent &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathways. DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism of these different pathways.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts show different temperature&#8208;dependent CO2RR performance due to their different adsorption behaviour of key reaction intermediates.







Abstract
Reaction temperature is an important parameter to tune the selectivity and activity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to different thermodynamics of CO2RR and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, temperature&#8208;dependent CO2RR over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are investigated from 303 to 343&#8197;K. Increasing the reaction temperature improves and decreases CO Faradaic efficiency over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts at high overpotentials, respectively. CO current density over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst increases with temperature, then gets into a plateau at 323&#8197;K, finally reaches the maximum value of 185.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 343&#8197;K. While CO current density over Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst achieves the maximum value of 252.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 323&#8197;K, and then drops significantly to 202.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 343&#8197;K. Temperature programmed desorption results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the difference of temperature&#8208;dependent variation on CO Faradaic efficiency and current density between Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts results from the varied adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates during CO2RR.

Sperm whale derived&#160;ambergris has historically been valued for its distinctive olfactory properties. Today, synthetic routes toward the contained (S)&#8208;y&#8208;dihydroionone and its optical antipode, emitting a floral orris&#8208;type odour, are of interest to the fragrance industry. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108037), Rebecca Buller et&#8197;al. employ engineered squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases for the monocyclization of geometric geranylacetone isomers into y&#8208;dihydroionone antipodes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over&#8208;oxidation in alkaline urea oxidation to dominate NO2&#8722; formation over N2 has been discovered by Xuejing Yang, Yefei Li, Ming Gong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107886). The identified nitrogen conversion network and reaction mechanism has important implications for sustainable chemistry and inspires new rationales for novel catalyst designs for the electrochemical urea oxidation into N2 products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid/liquid interface, studied by scanning tunnelling microscopy and simulated by GFN&#8208;FF calculations. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111869), Stefan Grimme, Stefan&#8208;S. Jester, Sigurd H&#246;ger, and co&#8208;workers show that the fullerene ester performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Crosslinked Polymer Networks for Highly E&#64256;ective Iodine Adsorption from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks designed for iodine capture is reported. These materials were prepared by Sonogashira coupling of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;alkynylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole with bishalide building blocks with different electronic properties and molecular sizes. Despite their low Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface areas, iodine vapor adsorption capacities of up to 3.38 g g&#8208;1 were seen, a finding ascribed to the presence of a large number of e&#64256;ective sorption sites including macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;rich cavities, aryl units, and alkyne groups within the material. One particular system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective at iodine capture from water (uptake capacity of 3.24 g g&#8208;1 from a concentrated aqueous KI/I2 solution at ambient temperature). Fast capture kinetics (kobs = 7.814 g g&#8208;1 min&#8208;1) were seen.. Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP is able to remove 93.2% of iodine from an aqueous source phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying the Conversion Mechanism to Broaden Cathode Options in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25114-25121, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in CuI cathodes were studied. This direct conversion mechanism can be generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality, which enriches the Zn2+ storage mechanism and broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn2+ storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn2+ intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn2+ intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Thick Wafer&#8208;Size NiO Films with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetic Behavior</title>

An atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy allows wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films to be grown with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. The sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior.







Abstract
Adding ferromagnetism into semiconductors attracts much attentions due to its potential usage of magnetic spins in novel devices, such as spin field&#8208;effect transistors. However, it remains challenging to stabilize their ferromagnetism above room temperature. Here we introduce an atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy to grow wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. Surface lattice defects break the magnetic symmetry of NiO and produce surface ferromagnetic behaviors. Our sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 157&#8197;emu/cc and coercivity of 418&#8197;Oe. Attributed to wafer size, the easily&#8208;transferred NiO thin film is further verified in a magnetoresistance device. Our work provides a sub&#8208;nanometric platform to produce wafer&#8208;size ferromagnetic NiO thin films as atomic layer magnetic units in future transparent magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surfaces by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25028-25033, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system, a bare gold surface which has chiral phases was shown to prefer the adsorption of D&#8208;type amino acid without relying on the organic selector layer on the surface.







Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.

In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D-enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D-amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Flexible high&#8208;voltage&#8208;tolerant COF SSE films with a holistically oriented channel structure, high ionic conductivity, and remarkable mechanical strength enabled the development of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811; see picture). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles as well as high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and mechanical foldability.







Abstract
By introducing lithiophilic groups and electrochemically stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkages, we prepared covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a large band gap with an ultralow HOMO value (&#8722;6.2&#8197;eV under vacuum) and oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (versus Li+/Li) as solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). The obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed a holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young's modulus of 10.5&#8197;GPa. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that lithium ions are transmitted in this COF SSE by directional hopping paths with fast drift velocity. The COF SSE film was used to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles, high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%), and could also withstand abuse tests, such as folding.

         <title>Dense Packing of Acetylene in a Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>

An ultra&#8208;microporous Al&#8208;MOF with suitable pore confinement enables the dense packing of C2H2 molecules for efficient C2H2/CO2 separation, exhibiting the benchmark balance between high separation performance, low cost, high stability, and large&#8208;scale synthesis for industrial applications.







Abstract
Porous materials for C2H2/CO2 separation mostly suffer from high regeneration energy, poor stability, or high cost that largely dampen their industrial implementation. A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost. We herein report a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H) for highly efficient C2H2/CO2 separation. The suitable pore confinement in CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H can not only provide multipoint binding interactions with C2H2 but also enable the dense packing of C2H2 inside the pores. This material exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage densities of 392&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 and highly selective adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 at ambient conditions, achieved by a low C2H2 adsorption enthalpy (27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, affording both large C2H2 uptake of 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high separation factor of 3.4. CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H achieves the benchmark balance between separation performance, stability, and cost for C2H2/CO2 separation.

         <title>A General Principle for DUV NLO Materials: &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Confinement Enlarges Band Gap**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25063-25067, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance DUV NLO materials whose band gaps are further enhanced. This principle is valid for all the DUV NLO materials known to date (the Chinese lunar year of the ox). Guided by this approach, the carbonophosphates are discovered for the first time as new DUV NLO candidates. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 exhibits the shortest SHG output laser among phosphates to date.







Abstract
Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7&#8197;eV wider than those of singular carbonates.

         <title>Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rational Design of a Multifunctional 3D Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Borax Layer</title>

A functional 3D cross&#8208;linked polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8208;borax layer possesses good electrolyte wettability, K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and structural stability, enabling a stable K plating and stripping process for more than 700&#8197;h of cycling without dendrite formation.







Abstract
K metal is the optimal anode for K&#8208;ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issues due to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium&#8208;metal batteries, a 3D polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8201;(PVA)&#8208;borax layer is designed, which enables a dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;plating/stripping process. The protective layer possesses good wettability, high K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;borax (PVA&#8208;borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25&#8201;% DOD and 50&#8201;% DOD, the PVA&#8208;borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180&#8197;h and 100&#8197;h, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;K metal is the optimal anode for K-ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issues due to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K-dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium-metal batteries, a 3D polyvinyl-alcohol&#8201;(PVA)-borax layer is designed, which enables a dendrite-free K-plating/stripping process. The protective layer possesses good wettability, high K-ion diffusivity, and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA-borax (PVA-borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25&#8201;% DOD and 50&#8201;% DOD, the PVA-borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180&#8197;h and 100&#8197;h, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Tri&#8208;Mode Emission for Single&#8208;Component White Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24984-24990, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of tri&#8208;mode afterglow is proposed to construct single&#8208;component white organic afterglow molecules by harvesting high&#8208;lying excitons on S1 and T1 for blue and low&#8208;lying excitons on T1* for yellow afterglow. After selectively modulating the intensity of yellow afterglow upon photoactivation, white organic afterglow with a lifetime up to 0.61&#8197;s and a quantum efficiency over 14&#8201;% was achieved.







Abstract
Achieving single&#8208;component white organic afterglow remains a great challenge owing to the difficulties in simultaneously supporting long&#8208;lived emissions from varied excited states of a molecule for complementary afterglow. Here, an extraordinary tri&#8208;mode emission from the radiative decays of singlet (S1), triplet (T1), and stabilized triplet (T1*) excited states was proposed to afford white afterglow through modulating the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) and exciton trapping depth (ETD). Low&#8208;lying T1* for yellow afterglow was constructed by H&#8208;aggregation engineering with large ETD and trace isomer doping, while high&#8208;lying T1 and S1 for blue afterglow with thermally activated emission feature were realized by reducing &#916;EST through donor&#8211;acceptor molecular design. Therefore, the single&#8208;component white afterglow with high efficiency of 14.1&#8201;% and a lifetime of 0.61&#8197;s was achieved by rationally regulating the afterglow intensity ratios of complementary emissions from S1, T1, and&#8197;T1*.

         <title>Impact of the Difluoromethylene Group in the Organocatalyzed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorohydrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24924-24929, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new interaction was discovered between C(sp3)F2 and an acylated chiral isothiourea, allowing an enantioselective recognition. This interaction was explored theoretically and experimentally in the kinetic resolution of racemic difluorohydrins, affording optically active organofluorines with a high level of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Due to the omnipresence of chiral organofluorine compounds in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material chemistry, the development of enantioselective methods for their preparation is highly desirable. In the present study, the enantioselective organocatalyzed acylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorohydrins using a commercially available chiral isothiourea is reported through a kinetic resolution (KR) process. It reveals that the difluoromethylene moiety (C(sp3)F2) can serve as a directing group through electrostatic fluorine&#8211;cation interactions, greatly improving the enantioselectivity of the KR. In this context, a broad range of fluorinated alcohols such as valuable 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols could be synthesized with exquisite enantiocontrol (typically &gt;99:1 er). Turning to 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, we also demonstrated that aromatic and fluorinated groups were mutually compatible to provide the expected enantioenriched adducts with &gt;99:1 er.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25128-25134, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. KYp self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation and leakage on the cell membrane. The peptide drugs internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide nanoparticle.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]2 (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), KYp can be dephosphorylated and self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation on cell membrane. Consequently, KYp internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide, and IC50 value of KYp is approximately 5 times lower than that of free peptide. Therefore, the in vivo self&#8208;assembly induced phase separation on cell membrane promises a new strategy to improve the drug delivery efficacy in cancer therapy.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow Metal Sulfides via Reverse Cation Exchange Reactions for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

A Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted route inspired by the hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle was employed for successfully synthesizing a family of hollow metal sulfide (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS, CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1) via cation exchange reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a general Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted and reverse cation exchange&#8208;mediated growth strategy for fabricating hollow multinary metal sulfide. Unlike the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to give a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructures has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as&#8208;synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS), and quaternary compound (single&#8208;atom platinum anchored ZnxCd1&#8722;xS; ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductors obtained could significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Owing to the efficient charge transfer, the ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1 exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO, with the highest CO generation rate of 75.31&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced, Self&#8208;Traced Nanomotors on the Surface of Silicon</title>

Gold&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;based motors moving on the silicon surface are demonstrated. Their movement leaves a trace engraved on the silicon surface, representing an exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. Their velocity can be greatly enhanced by the plasmon resonance. Moreover, the traces generated by the movement of gold nanosphere dimers and trimers also provide a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale silicon patterns.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon&#8208;enhanced Au nanocrystal&#8208;based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;vinyloxiranes with the challenging nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters) was achieved. It was successfully applied to the stereodivergent synthesis of structurally rigid spirocyclic framework. A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner.







Abstract
The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.

         <title>Triggered Reversible Disassembly of an Engineered Protein Nanocage**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel protein nanocage has been developed capable of on&#8208;demand reversible disassembly via simple buffer exchanges under mild conditions. Data presented herein also show the nanocage is capable of in vivo and in vitro cargo loading, suggesting a broad range of possible applications in biocatalysis, bionanotechnology, and biomedicine. Additional findings include structure determination and protein design verification via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy.







Abstract
Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.

         <title>Cathodic Electrodeposition of MOF Films Using Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24950-24957, November 15, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films were made by cathodic electrodeposition using hydrogen peroxide as a pro&#8208;base whose single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials thus preventing the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extending the range of possible metal nodes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be made by cathodic electrodeposition, where a Br&#248;nsted base is formed electrochemically which deprotonates the MOF linkers that are present in solution as undissociated/partially dissociated weak acids. However, the co&#8208;deposition of metal and the narrow range of possible metal nodes limit the scope of this method. In this work, we propose the use of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide assisted cathodic deposition or HPACD), to overcome these limitations. Electrochemical measurements indicate that in DMF, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to superoxide anions that deprotonate the carboxylic ligands. This single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials than all previous reported methods. This prevents the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extends the range of possible metal nodes. Various pure MOF films (HKUST&#8208;1, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) and MOF&#8208;5) were prepared via this approach. HPACD was also used for the preparation of patterned MOF films and of flexible Cu&#8208;BTC coated paper membranes which reject 99.1&#8201;% of Rose Bengal from water with a permeance of 8.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1.

         <title>Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N&#8208;Methylmaleimide**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24991-24996, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cycloaddition of tropolone with maleimide in the presence of weak base involves an ambimodal transition state that leads directly to both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N&#8208;methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N&#8208;methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo&#8208;adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo&#8208;adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo&#8208;product, which is thermodynamically more stable.

     alt="Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N-Methylmaleimide**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycloaddition of tropolone with maleimide in the presence of weak base involves an ambimodal transition state that leads directly to both &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-adducts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N-methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo- and exo-products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (&#969;B97X-D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N-methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo- and exo-products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo-adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo-adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo-product, which is thermodynamically more stable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Droplet Dynamics through a Buffer Strategy with a Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Sensitive Fluorogenic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25104-25113, November 15, 2021. </description>

We report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by using structure illumination microscopy. LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG with fresh probe molecules from outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized.







Abstract
Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better&#8208;performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG by intact probe molecules outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Using this probe, two LD coalescence modes were discovered. The dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation, i.e., a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of LD&#8208;FG makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium Ions Enables Collective Total Syntheses of Indole Alkaloids</title>

Catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions was developed for the versatile synthesis of enantiomerically enriched C1&#8208;alkynyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines, the utility of which was demonstrated by concise collective total syntheses of the seven indole alkaloids harmicine, geissoschizol, geissoschizine, akuammicine, desethyleburnamonine, eburnamonine, and larutensine within 10 steps (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.

         <title>A Phase Inversion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Fabrication of Helical Microfibers towards Versatile Artificial Abdominal Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25089-25096, November 15, 2021. </description>

A novel phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) technology is developed to continuously produce stretchable high&#8208;strength polycaprolactone (PCL) helical microfibers with controllable structures. The helical microfibers are weaved into strong, bi&#8208;oriented stretchable, flexible and biocompatible artificial skins meshes, which can be used to prevent abdominal incisional hernia formation and promote wound healing.







Abstract
Microfluidic spinning technology (MST), incorporating microfluidics with chemical reactions, has gained considerable interest for constructing anisotropic advanced microfibers, especially helical microfibers. However, these efforts suffer from the limited material choices, restricting their applications. Here, a new phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) method is proposed for producing helical microfibers. This method undergoes a physicochemical phase inversion process, which is capable of efficiently manufacturing strong (tensile stress of more than 25&#8197;MPa), stretchable, flexible and biocompatible helical microfibers. The helical microfibers can be used to fabricate bi&#8208;oriented stretchable artificial abdominal skin, preventing incisional hernia formation and promoting the wound healing without conglutination. This research not only offers a universal approach to design helical microfibers but also provides a new insight into artificial skin.

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>

[Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; formed in a reaction of (Sn2Sb2)2&#8722; with [AuMePPh3] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free&#8208;standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.







Abstract
The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#8901;py (1; crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side&#8208;products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.

Three synthetic routes to the completely unsubstituted corrole are described. This allows for full characterization of five metal complexes chelated by this corrole, which were used to uncover unique beneficial features that are relevant to clean energy catalysis and many other purposes.







Abstract
Corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly cross new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We have obtained the substituent&#8208;free corrole by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.

         <title>Tailored Chiral Copper Selenide Nanochannels for Ultrasensitive Enantioselective Recognition and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24997-25004, November 15, 2021. </description>

A chiral penicillamine&#8208;modified Cu2&#8722;xSe/AAO heterostructure membrane nanochannel was fabricated for the enantioselective detection of naproxen based on an electrochemical system.







Abstract
We constructed a tailorable membrane channel system consisting of penicillamine molecules intercalated in copper selenide nanoparticles (Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs), which exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the near infrared region (CD, 800&#8211;1600&#8197;nm) with a maximum intensity of 164.5&#8197;mdeg at 1440&#8197;nm. The chiral ligand hybridized to the surface of achiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs by breaking the intrinsic symmetry of Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs and further large&#8208;scale assembly induced strong optical activity. The fabricated multilayer chiral membrane achieved an increased rectification ratio (RR) up to 114. The integration of penicillamine allowed for high enantioselective recognition against naproxen,which displayed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.027&#8197;nM.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25075-25081, November 15, 2021. </description>

A stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of custom&#8208;built A, B, and C building blocks gives ABC baskets. Such enantioselective and modular construction allows choosing depth and shape of the cavitand's nonpolar pocket while also selecting desired functional groups at the rim. Building more effective mimics of biological receptors and catalysts is within reach.







Abstract
The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprised of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched A (borochloronorbornene), B (iodobromonorbornene), and C (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive A&#8208;to&#8208;B and then AB&#8208;to&#8208;C Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched ABC cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a)&#8197;an enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either tBu, Et, or Me esters, (b)&#8197;both enantiomers of a so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space, and (c)&#8197;a photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.

         <title>Luminescent Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks for Multicolor Particle Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24968-24975, November 15, 2021. </description>

A supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is established using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and dye molecules. Tunable and customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) is achieved on inorganic, organic, and biological particles, with potential applications in the physical and life sciences.







Abstract
The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dyes. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5&#8197;min) produces ultrathin coatings (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH values from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences.

         <title>Effect of Surfactants on the Molecular Structure of the Buried Oil/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25143-25150, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increased ordering of oil molecules' aliphatic chains and the enhanced alignment of water molecules at the oil/water interface was revealed upon increasing adsorption of anionic surfactant using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. The surfactant coverage inducing the highest&#8208;ordered oil molecule configuration at the interface matches a significant reduction of interfacial tension and high emulsion stability.







Abstract
The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration owing to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bridged Methylnaphthyl Palladium Dimers as Versatile Catalyst Precursors in Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25151-25160, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide&#8208;bridged 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl palladium dimers are presented as convenient, yet highly efficient palladium sources for cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The bench&#8208;stable complexes smoothly react with various ligands yielding monoligated palladium precatalysts. These display record&#8208;setting activity in various catalytic reactions, clearly beyond that achievable by ligand screening alone.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium dimers are presented as multipurpose Pd&#8208;precursors, ideally suited for catalytic method development and preparative organic synthesis. By simply mixing with phosphine or carbene ligands, they are in situ converted into well&#8208;defined monoligated complexes. Their catalytic performance was benchmarked against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems in challenging Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, Heck, Suzuki and Negishi couplings, and ketone arylations. Their use enabled record&#8208;setting activities, beyond those achievable by optimization of the ligand alone. The MeNAP catalysts permit syntheses of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted arenes and bulky anilines in near&#8208;quantitative yields at room temperature, allow mono&#8208;arylations of small ketones, and enable so far elusive cross&#8208;couplings of secondary alkyl boronic acids with aryl chlorides.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones Bearing Two Vicinal Stereocenters Enabled by Synergistic Copper and Iridium Catalysis</title>

An unprecedented asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization between racemic aldimine esters and racemic vinylethylene carbonate catalyzed by synergistic Cu/Ir catalysis is presented. The metalated azomethine ylide acts as a two&#8208;atom unit and opens up access to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereogenic centers in a stereodivergent manner.







Abstract
By virtue of a fundamentally new reaction model of azomethine ylide serving as a two&#8208;atom synthon, we present the first example of stereodivergent preparation of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via synergistic Cu/Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization, and all four stereoisomers of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereocenters are accessible with excellent diastereoselective and enantioselective control. The chiral IrIII&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate was separated and characterized to understand the origin of the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the initial C&#8722;C bond formation process. Control experiments shed some light on the catalyst/substrate and catalyst/catalyst interactions in this dual catalytic system to rationalize the related kinetic/dynamic kinetic resolution process with different catalyst combinations. The enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products were converted into an array of structurally complex chiral molecules and organocatalysts that were otherwise inaccessible.

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle Refinement</title>

Refinement of FeP nanoparticles can result in a gradual increase in the graphitization degree and interface magnetization. Furthermore, it provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity during cycling.







Abstract
We present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D carbon framework (FeP@NC). Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, a sodium&#8208;ion battery with the FeP@NC composite exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 82.0&#8201;% in 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. Also, particle refinement leads to a capacity increase during cycling. The FeP nanoparticles go through a refining&#8211;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling. The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Encapsulation of Naphthalene Diimide (NDI) Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers: A Tool for Understanding Photoluminescence</title>

This article demonstrates a novel synthetic strategy that can be used to tune the interstrand distance between conjugated polymers with unprecedented precision. This control provides an ideal platform for fundamental insight into the solid&#8208;state optical properties of NDI polymers.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are an important class of chromophores for optoelectronic devices. Understanding and controlling their excited state properties, in particular, radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes are among the greatest challenges that must be overcome. We report the synthesis and characterization of a molecularly encapsulated naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer, one of the most successfully used motifs, and explore its structural and optical properties. The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect of interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non&#8208;encapsulated analogue P(NDI&#8208;2OD&#8208;T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing &#960;&#8208;interchain stacking distance. This suggests that decreasing &#960;&#8208;stacking distances may be an attractive method to enhance the radiative properties of conjugated polymers in contrast to the current paradigm where it is viewed as a source of optical quenching.

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25048-25054, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable energy transfer with designable direction, from second linkers to pristine MOFs or from pristine MOFs to second linkers, was achieved in the whole visible spectrum via installing color&#8208;full emissive second linkers into the full&#8208;color emissive pristine MOFs.







Abstract
While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr6 cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for linker installation. Six full&#8208;color emissive 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L, in which the ET can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via ET in LMOFs.

Herein, five Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cluster-based LMOFs, HIAM-400X (X=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and its derivative-based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM-400X as a pristine scaffold for linker installation. Six full-color emissive 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and its derivative-based dicarboxylic acids (L) were successfully installed into HIAM-400X matrix to form HIAM-400X-L, in which the ET can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two-dimensional space in tuning the emission via ET in LMOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Systematic Study of the Effects of Complex Structure on Aryl Iodide Oxidative Addition at Bipyridyl&#8208;Ligated Gold(I) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24976-24983, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assessment of the effects of complex structure on the oxidative addition mechanism of aryl iodides at bipyridyl&#8208;ligated AuI&#8208;centers is described. It is shown that the hemilability of the bipy ligand and the electropositivity of the Au&#8208;center are important factors, leading to facile oxidative addition with electron&#8208;poor ligands and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides. These unusual observations contrast established Pd&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to study the unusual mechanism of oxidative addition of aryl iodides to [bipyAu(C2H4)]+ complexes. The modular nature of this system allowed a systematic assessment of the effects of complex structure. Computational comparisons between cationic gold and the isolobal (neutral) Pd0 and Pt0 complexes revealed similar mechanistic features, but with oxidative addition being significantly favored for the group&#8197;10 metals. Further differences between Au and Pd were seen in experimental studies: studying reaction rates as a function of electronic and steric properties showed that ligands bearing more electron&#8208;poor functionality increase the rate of oxidative addition; in a complementary way, electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides give faster rates. This divergence in mechanism compared to Pd suggests that Ar&#8722;X oxidative addition with Au can underpin a broad range of new or complementary transformations.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Aromaticity Relief as an Approach to Stabilize Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25082-25088, November 15, 2021. </description>

Radicals substituted with anti&#8208;aromatic rings have greater stability than radicals with aromatic substituents as a result of a new stereoelectronic stabilization approach driven by anti&#8208;aromaticity relief.







Abstract
A new strategy to stabilize free radicals electronically is described by conjugating formally antiaromatic substituents to the free radical. With an antiaromatic substituent, the radical acts as an electron sink to allow configuration mixing of a low&#8208;energy zwitterionic state that provides antiaromaticity relief to the substituent. A combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, VT&#8208;EPR and VT&#8208;UV/Vis spectroscopy, as well as computational analysis, was used to investigate this phenomenon. We find that this strategy of antiaromaticity relief is successful at stabilizing radicals, but only if the antiaromatic substituent is constrained to be planar by synthetically imposed conformational restraints that enable state mixing. This work leads to the counterintuitive finding that increasing the antiaromaticity of the radical substituent leads to greater radical stability, providing proof of concept for a new stereoelectronic approach for stabilizing free radicals.

Topochemical reactions are lattice&#8208;controlled reactions that occur in crystals or other confined media. However, only a handful of topochemical reactions are known so far. In their Communication on page&#8197;24875, Ravichandran Khazeber and Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan report a new topochemical reaction: a topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction, in which a proximally placed azide and an alkene undergo a cycloaddition reaction to form triazoline in a regiospecific, stereospecific, and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion.

Massarinolin A and the purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes containing a complex tetracyclic skeleton. In their Communication on page&#8197;24828, Mingji Dai and co&#8208;workers report a divergent and enantioselective approach to complete the first total syntheses of five tetracyclic bergamotane sesquiterpenes, which also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. Their approach features a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the challenging bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane core and a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone moiety.

Secondary alcohols , which follow either an E1 or an E2 elimination pathway, were investigated by Eszter Bar&#225;th, Johannes&#8197;A. Lercher, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;24806. It is known that water forms clusters within the zeolite channels; however, its effect on the intrinsic mechanism of the dehydration needs to be fundamentally understood. It was found that the volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint. The individual TOFs depend on the substrate&#8208;related mechanism.

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>

This Minireview summarises the known chemistry for the preparation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives reported up to mid&#8208;2021. Bridge substitution on BCP derivatives often provides patent&#8208;free, novel vectors for substituent disposition in drug discovery and materials science; this capacity may prove to be transformational in the coming years.







Abstract
&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion&#8208;Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>

The membrane in redox flow batteries (RFBs) plays a critical role in their practical application. Promising RFB membranes require the deliberate design of their materials chemistry and microstructure. This Review highlights the design rationales of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level with in&#8208;depth discussion of the structure&#8211;property relationships, and subsequently discusses future prospect in the field.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are among the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability, and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion&#8208;conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly. Specific systems must meet additional requirements, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this Review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on new chemistry, novel microstructures, and innovative fabrication strategies. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.

Specific systems must meet additional requirements, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this Review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on new chemistry, novel microstructures, and innovative fabrication strategies. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first total syntheses of complex bergamotane sesquiterpenes massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C were achieved with key steps involving an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement, a furan oxidative cyclization, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation and sigmatropic elimination. Our synthesis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A.







Abstract
Massarinolin&#8197;A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxaspiro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the exo methylene group of massarinolin&#8197;A.

         <title>Cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide as a Building Block for P,C,N Conjugated Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24817-24822, November 15, 2021. </description>

Na[PCO] reacts with Ph3ECl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) and Na[N(SiMe3)2] to form the series of anions [Ph3E&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722;. The silylated anion forms PCN heteroallenes in reactions with tetrel chlorides and binds via nitrogen to triphenylborane. P&#8208;nucleophilicity and lability of the silyl substituent in [Ph3Si&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722; are evidenced in reactions with isocyanates and carbodiimides, which afford phosphorus analogues of cyanourea and 2&#8208;cyanoguanidine.







Abstract
The cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide anion was prepared as a sodium salt from 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. The electronic structure of this new cyano(silyl)phosphanide was studied via computational methods and its reactivity investigated using various electrophiles and Lewis acids, demonstrating its P&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilicity. The ambident reactivity is in agreement with computations. The silyl group also shows lability and therefore the cyano(silyl)phosphanide can be considered as a phosphacyanamide synthon, [PCN]2&#8722;, and serves as building block for the transfer of a PCN moiety.

         <title>Topochemical Ene&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24849-24853, November 15, 2021. </description>

MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allow photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

         <title>Organophosphine&#8208;Sandwiched Copper Iodide Cluster Enables Charge Trapping</title>

Molecular n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction based on biligand&#8208;sandwiched copper iodide nanocluster is constructed as charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories featuring large memory windows and energy&#8208;saving operation. Spatial electronic anisotropy of the lamellar structure and steric and insulating effects of phosphine ligands effectively hinder intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping as a basis of real single&#8208;molecule devices.







Abstract
Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction of biligand&#8208;sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy&#8208;saving operation. We found that the hole confinement on the p&#8208;type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n&#8208;type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon&#8208;phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual&#8208;ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping. Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement.

Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I are designed and synthesized successfully based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is the largest among the reported borates and phosphates.







Abstract
Exploring non &#960;&#8208;conjugated phosphate birefringent crystal with a large birefringence has been a great challenge. Herein, based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), two new compounds, Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I, were designed and synthesized successfully, maintaining the layer structural feature and enhancing the optical anisotropy of crystals. In particular, the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is larger than or equal to 0.664 @546&#8197;nm, which is largest among the reported borates and phosphates, even surpassing commercial birefringent crystals YVO4 and TiO2. This work indicates that a breakthrough in birefringence of inorganic compound was achieved. Also, it provides a guiding idea for exploring large birefringence materials in the future.

         <title>Biocatalytic, Intermolecular C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24864-24869, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of P411 heme enzymes enables intermolecular C&#8722;H amidation with high yields and exquisite enantioselectivity. The biocatalytic process utilizes stable hydroxamate esters as nitrenoid precursors and is amenable to scaleup. Mechanistic studies reveal rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by a stepwise, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Directed evolution of heme proteins has opened access to new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic activity that can be harnessed to tackle synthetic challenges. Among these, reactions resulting from active site iron&#8208;nitrenoid intermediates present a powerful strategy to forge C&#8722;N bonds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic, intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation reaction operating at mild and scalable conditions. With hydroxamate esters as nitrene precursors, feedstock aromatic compounds can be converted to chiral amides with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). Kinetic and computational analysis of the enzymatic reaction reveals rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by stepwise hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.

Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid enables a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl iodides, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems.







Abstract
Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid has been identified to enable a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the coordinating orientation of the chiral amino acid to the arylpalladium(II) center allows for high levels of stereochemical control.

         <title>Influence of Intracrystalline Ionic Strength in MFI Zeolites on Aqueous Phase Dehydration of Methylcyclohexanols</title>

         <dc:description>
The volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint. The individual TOFs depend on the substrate related mechanism (E1 vs. E2).







Abstract
The impact of the concentration of hydrated hydronium ions and in turn of the local ionic strength in MFI zeolites has been investigated for the aqueous phase dehydration of 4&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E1 mechanism) and cis&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E2 mechanism). The E2 pathway with the latter alcohol led to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher activity. The catalytic activity normalized to the hydronium ions (turnover frequency, TOF) passed through a pronounced maximum, which is attributed to the increasing excess chemical potential of the alcohols in the pores, increasing in parallel with the ionic strength and the additional work caused by repulsive interactions and charge separation induced by the bulky alcohols. While the maximum in rate observed is invariant with the mechanism or substitution, the reaction pathway is influencing the activation parameters differently.

A benzimidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is presented. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Described herein is an imidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol. It is worth reflecting on the unique roles played by the nitroso group in this domino reaction. It functions as a linchpin by first offering an electrophilic site (N) for the initial C&#8722;N bond formation while the resulting amine performs the nucleophilic addition to form the second C&#8722;N bond. Additionally, it could facilitate the final oxidative aromatization as an oxidant. The atropisomeric products could be conveniently elaborated to a series of axially chiral derivatives, enabling the exploitation of N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles for their potential utilities in asymmetric catalysis.

Ion soft&#8208;landing was used to bind molecular fragment ions, generated in the gas phase, to molecular ions of same polarity by depositing them successively on surfaces. This can generate highly charged molecular ions which are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
While reactions between ions and neutral molecules in the gas phase have been studied extensively, reactions between molecular ions of same polarity remain relatively unexplored. Herein we show that reactions between fragment ions generated in the gas phase and molecular ions of the same polarity are possible by soft&#8208;landing of both reagents on surfaces. The reactive [B12I11]1&#8722; anion was deposited on a surface layer built up by landing the generally unreactive [B12I12]2&#8722;. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the generated material shows that [B24I23]3&#8722; was formed. A computational study shows that the product is metastable in the gas phase, but a charge&#8208;balanced environment of a grounded surface may stabilize the triply charged product, as suggested by model calculations. This opens new opportunities for the generation of highly charged clusters using unconventional building blocks from the gas phase.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Selective Deposition of Ultrathin Al2O3 on Copper Nanocrystals for Highly Stable CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24838-24843, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique was employed to selectively cover the (111) facets of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3, which significantly increases the faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 in both H&#8208;type and GDE flow cells. This Al2O3 overcoating also effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and aggregation of Cu NCs during CO2RR.







Abstract
Catalysts based on Cu nanocrystals (NCs) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion with high activity have been a subject of considerable interest, but poor stability and low selectivity for a single C2+ product remain obstacles for realizing sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral cycles. Here, we used the facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3 to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C) reaches a C2H4 faradaic efficiency of 60.4&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al2O3 overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C shown in stability tests.

A formal CH2&#8722;CH2 homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. Two single nucleophilic CH2 units are delivered to an isothiocyanate as competent electrophilic partner, resulting in the assembly of an imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds.







Abstract
A formal CH2&#8722;CH2 homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. The logic proposes the consecutive delivery of two single nucleophilic CH2 units to an isothiocyanate&#8212;as competent electrophilic partner&#8212;resulting in the assembling of a rare imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The single synthetic operation procedure documents genuine chemocontrol, as indicated by the tolerance to various reactive elements decorating the starting materials. Significantly, the double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, thus not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds (e.g. boron).

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24882-24887, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the urgent need to produce high grade sodium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Our synthesis involves the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate to sodium metal under anhydrous conditions, which prevents the formation of NaF and other commonly found hydrolysis products seen in commercial samples. The high purity allows for up to 3&#8197;M electrolyte concentrations to be achieved.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF6 in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3&#8197;M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8208;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2&#8197;M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1&#8197;M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.

&lt;p&gt;This work addresses the urgent need to produce high grade sodium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt for sodium-ion batteries. Our synthesis involves the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate to sodium metal under anhydrous conditions, which prevents the formation of NaF and other commonly found hydrolysis products seen in commercial samples. The high purity allows for up to 3&#8197;M electrolyte concentrations to be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metathesis Cascade&#8208;Triggered Depolymerization of Enyne Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are developed to enable cascade depolymerization triggered by metathesis catalysts. Stable in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, and at elevated temperatures, these enyne SIPs can undergo efficient depolymerization in response to external stimuli. This work established a general approach to stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled release of heterocyclic reagents.







Abstract
A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic Acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24811-24816, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes used to metabolically label legionaminic acid on bacterial flagella substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative legionaminyl transferase in Campylobacter jejuni (see picture). The labeled glycan could be detected intracellularly as its activated CMP analogue, on flagella by Western blot analysis, and on intact bacteria by confocal microscopy.







Abstract
Campylobacter jejuni is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily O&#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Herein, we report the development of a metabolic labeling method for Leg glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labeled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on C.&#8197;jejuni and its isogenic maf4 mutant we also further substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. Further evidence was provided by UPLC&#8211;MS detection of labeled CMP&#8208;Leg and an in silico model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in C.&#8197;jejuni motility and invasiveness.

         <title>A DNA Nanoflower&#8208;Assisted Separation&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Platform with a Commercial Pregnancy Test Strip</title>

Bound then free: DNA nanoflowers are used to immobilize a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#8208;modified DNA strand (hCG&#8208;DNA), which can be released by DNA amplicons from loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) via toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and detected with an off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf pregnancy test strip (PTS) in a separation&#8208;free one&#8208;step process. The method is capable of achieving single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious human diseases. Herein, we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strips (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2&#8197;copies&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24859-24863, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridecasaccharide glycan domain of lipooligosaccharides from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii was synthesized. The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base&#8208;sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.







Abstract
The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.

The photodegradation pathway of acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini for organic photovoltaics was elucidated as a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift (see picture). This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we elucidate the photodegradation pathway of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. Using IT&#8208;4F as a benchmark example, we isolated the photoproducts and proved them isomers of IT&#8208;4F formed by a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift. This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction path (quenchable by oxygen). Adding controlled amounts of the photoproduct P1 to PM6:IT&#8208;4F bulk heterojunction cells led to a progressive decrease in photocurrent and fill factor attributed to its poor absorption and charge transport properties. The reaction is a general photodegradation pathway for a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini, and its rate varies with the structure of the donor and acceptor moiety.

         <title>Molten Salt Electrochemical Modulation of Iron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen consisting of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with highly grafted Fe3C nanoparticles is an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries owing to the facilitated adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides.







Abstract
Sulfur hosts with rationally designed chemistry to confine and convert lithium polysulfides are of prime importance for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A molten salt electrochemical modulation of iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen is herein demonstrated as formation of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with grafted Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C@Fe3C), which is rationalized as an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Fe3C over nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon contributes to enhanced adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur&#8208;loaded Fe3C@C@Fe3C electrodes hence show a high capacity, good cyclic stability, and enhanced rate performance. This work highlights the unique chemistry of metal carbides on facilitating adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides, and also extends the scope of molten salt electrolysis to elaboration of energy materials.

         <title>Desolvation of Peptide Bond by O to S Substitution Impacts Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24870-24874, November 15, 2021. </description>

A C=O to C=S substitution in the amide bond dramatically alters the water structure around the thioamide bond, ultimately reducing the microenvironment polarity. The increased hydrophobicity of the modified peptide bond is utilized to amplify the thermostability of proteins by this single atom substitution.







Abstract
Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14&#8201;&#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylcarbocyclization of Alkynes Using SEt as a Traceless Directing Group: Access to Cyclopentenes and Indenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentenes and indenes are important structural scaffolds in synthetic, medical, and material chemistry. Cyclization of alkynes via remote C&#8208;H functionalization is an appealing approach to construct these motifs due to its high efficiency and step&#8208;economy. Herein, a traceless directing group strategy was designed to reverse the regioselectivity of radical addition which enabled an unprecedented photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes by forming C&#8208;C bond on inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bond. It offers a facile access to decorated cyclopentenes and indenes under mild conditions. The resultant products could be converted into a set of valuable molecular scaffolds, including a key intermediate of AM&#8208;6226. Mechanistic experiments suggest a radical cascade pathway comprising a Markovnikov&#8208;type sulfonylation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, and &#946;&#8208;elimination. This study lays further groundwork for the use of anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization in rapidly assembling five&#8208;membered carbocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Manipulating Space&#8208;resolved Persistent Luminescence in Core&#8208;shell MOFs Heterostructures via Reversible Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, photo&#8208;controllable persistent luminescence at the single crystal level can be achieved by the integration of long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and photochromism within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for the first time. Moreover, the multiblock core&#8211;shell heterojunctions have been prepared utilizing the isostructural MOFs through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits bright yellow afterglow emission that gradually disappears upon further irradiation, but the core does not show such property. Benefitting from combined persistent luminescence and photochromic behavior, a multiple encryption demo can be facilely designed based on the dynamic manipulating RTP via reversible photochromism. Therefore, this work not only develops new types of dynamically photo&#8208;controllable afterglow switch, but also provides a method to obtain MOFs&#8208;based optical heterojunctions towards potential space/time&#8208;resolved information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as a Multiphoton Excitation Regulator for the Activation of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and oxidization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into value&#8208;added chemicals affords attractively economic and ecological benefits as well as central challenge in modern chemistry. Inspired by the natural enzymatic transformation, herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach to activate the inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen by integrating the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) events together into one metal&#8211;organic framework. The well&#8208;modified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) mimics oxidized CeIII&#8722;OEt moieties to generate CeIV&#8722;OEt chromophore and its reduced state mimics NAD&#8226; via PET. The in situ formed CeIV&#8722;OEt moiety triggers a LMCT excitation to form the alkoxy radical EtO&#8226;, abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, accompanying the recovery of CeIII&#8722;OEt and the formation of alkyl radicals. The formed NAD&#8226; activates oxygen to regenerate the NAD+ for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel double NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes, bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT), are achieved through a combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The chemical structures are clearly characterized by STM and AFM. Moreover, NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT can be further tailored to dications, which demonstrate similar electronic properties to their all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based isoelectronic structures bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene.







Abstract
Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT). The chemical structures are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT possess higher energy gaps than bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene. Interestingly, NBN&#8208;BT can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation and then to its dication. The energy gap of the NBN&#8208;BT dication is similar to that of bis&#8208;tetracene, indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the NBN&#8208;PT dication and peri&#8208;tetracene can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged peri&#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>SmCo5 with a Reconstructed Oxyhydroxide Surface for Spin&#8208;Selective Water Oxidation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarized spins occurring at the ferromagnetic/oxyhydroxide interface of surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy led to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins were aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C (see picture).







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface&#8208;reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with a spin&#8208;pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications, electrolyzers are operated at elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this study, we prepared surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy, which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that lead to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic the practical operation conditions of water electrolyzers. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Versatile Polymer Nanocapsules via Redox Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse and tunable polymer nanocapsules are synthesized via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules, dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. This streamlined method not only provides functional nanocapsules, but also enables the facile accommodation of functional cores for yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, expediting the development of multifunctional nanosystems.







Abstract
Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between &#8776;70 and 200&#8197;nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled nanomedicine based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with hidden missing linkers shows enhanced artesunate and photosensitizer co&#8208;loading capacity. In the presence of abundant physiological HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ from MOFs activates artesunate&#8208;based oxidative death of cancer cells. Released linkers undergo a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione, contributing to synergistic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of an ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3&#9633;1/3 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that have hidden missing linkers. The defects in MOFs originating from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system which oxidizes ATS to generate reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative death to cancer cells. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promise in advancing the practical use of ATS as an antitumor medicine.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled nanomedicine based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with hidden missing linkers shows enhanced artesunate and photosensitizer co-loading capacity. In the presence of abundant physiological HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from MOFs activates artesunate-based oxidative death of cancer cells. Released linkers undergo a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione, contributing to synergistic tumor therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of an ATS nanomedicine through the self-assembly with Mn[Co(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt; metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that have hidden missing linkers. The defects in MOFs originating from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co-loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate-activated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system which oxidizes ATS to generate reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative death to cancer cells. The released [Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect-engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promise in advancing the practical use of ATS as an antitumor medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>

Branching orientation control of four&#8208;arm junction lattices: by branch point sequences or by enforcing struts.







Abstract
Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (e.g., i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.

         <title>Rapid Iron(III)&#8722;Fluoride&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIII&#8722;F (formed via ScIII activation) activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with reaction rates equivalent to or higher than FeIII&#8722;OH and FeIV=O oxidants. The driving force for fast C&#8722;H activation is ascribed to the higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the product formed (BDEF&#8722;H&gt;&#8811;BDEO&#8722;H).







Abstract
We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8722;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric FeIII(F)&#8722;F&#8722;FeIII(F) complex (1) by reacting [FeII(NCCH3)2(TPA)](ClO4)2 (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane (difluoroiodobenzene). 1 was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [FeIII(TPA)(F)(X)]+ complex (2) where X=F/OTf. 1 and 2 were characterized using NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. 2 was a remarkably reactive FeIII reagent for oxidative C&#8722;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive FeIII and FeIV oxidants.

         <title>Diazaborines Are a Versatile Platform to Develop ROS&#8208;Responsive Antibody Drug Conjugates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of physiologically stable diazaborines in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the key to the construction of ROS&#8208;responsive antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. These conjugates are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells. In this study we show for the first time the synthesis of a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ADC (VL&#8208;DAB31&#8208;SN&#8208;38) that is highly selective and cytotoxic to B&#8208;cell lymphoma (CLBL&#8208;1 cell line, IC50 value of 54.1&#8197;nM). The synthesis of this ADC was possible due to the discovery that diazaborines (DABs) are a very effective ROS&#8208;responsive unit that are also very stable in buffer and in plasma. DFT calculations performed on this system revealed a favorable energetic profile (&#916;GR=&#8722;74.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) similar to the oxidation mechanism of aromatic boronic acids. DABs&#8217; very fast formation rate and modularity enabled the construction of different ROS&#8208;responsive linkers featuring self&#8208;immolative modules, bioorthogonal functions, and bioconjugation handles. These structures were used in the site&#8208;selective functionalization of a VL antibody domain and in the construction of the homogeneous ADC.

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and general method for the hydroboration of alkenes, including aryl alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, aliphatic alkenes, and bio&#8208;derived alkenes, using BX3 as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The reaction was also applied to the synthesis of linear and branched 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes. The reaction is thought to proceed by a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3 (X=Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an &#8220;H&#8221; source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double bond is readily achieved in contrast to conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8211;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.

         <title>Rationally Designed Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 Hollow Heterostructures from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) are rationally designed and fabricated through a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;engaged synthetic approach. With the structural and compositional advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows efficient Zn&#8208;ion storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycle life.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn2+ insertion/extraction reactions.

         <title>Inhibition of Autophagy by a Small Molecule through Covalent Modification of the LC3 Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent probe, DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5, was discovered which demonstrates high selectivity to LC3A/B in the proteome. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 inhibits autophagy by attenuating LC3B lipidation, which subsequently reduces the extent of autophagic structure formation and later substrate degradation.







Abstract
The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins, including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post&#8208;translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR&#8208;interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering with the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discovered a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in&#8197;vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Bis(perfluoropinacolato)silane: A Neutral Silane Lewis Superacid Activates Si&#8722;F Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Si&#8208;based Lewis superacid was synthesized by using highly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoropinacolato substituents. The formed silane was obtained as the acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct and comprehensively characterized. The reaction with Et3SiF led to fluoride abstraction yielding the anionic fluorosilicate and the acetonitrile stabilized silylium ion. Catalysis screenings demonstrated high activity in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Despite the earth abundance and easy availability of silicon, only few examples of isolable neutral silicon centered Lewis superacids are precedent in the literature. To approach the general drawbacks of limited solubility and unselective deactivation pathways, we introduce a Lewis superacid, based on perfluorinated pinacol substituents. The compound is easily synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale as the corresponding acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct 1&#8901;(MeCN) and was fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations. Lewis acidity investigations by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and fluoride abstraction experiments indicate a Lewis superacidic nature. The challenging Si&#8722;F bond activation of Et3SiF is realized and promising catalytic properties are demonstrated, consolidating the potential applicability of silicon centered Lewis acids in synthetic catalysis.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Neutralization Assay Using Single Molecule Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed a simple neutralization assay based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. This assay can assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. We used this assay to profile neutralization capacity in patients infected with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and vaccinated individuals and show that this assay is useful for various clinical applications.







Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time and show that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify an alternative to the polymeric peptide drug Glatiramer Acetate (GA) used to treat multiple sclerosis, we tested peptide dendrimers with a size and composition similar to that of GA for their ability to induce the release of the cytokine IL1&#8208;Ra from primary human monocytes. The best dendrimer is as active as GA and is shown by fluorescence labelling to internalize into monocytes and to trigger a distinct anti&#8208;inflammatory response.







Abstract
Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based materials have been extensively explored in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate, but reaching high selectivity and durability at large current densities remains challenging. Here, a catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy was formed in situ through dynamic restructuring of Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers, leading to an excellent CO2 to formate performance over a wide potential window.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers can undergo in situ dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO2RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H2 pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy for electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for the design of active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel modular synthetic strategy for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade reaction. Notably, the obtained BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking.







Abstract
A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;a&#8208;1&#8201;i) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;n&#8208;1&#8201;t) and double [4]helicene (1&#8201;u&#8208;1&#8201;v) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8211;50&#8201;%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene 1&#8201;o forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene 1&#8201;u establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult-to-access structurally constrained boron-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc-B-PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho-aryl-substituted diarylalkynes.

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot that Autonomously Walks on the Cell Membrane to Drive Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA molecular robot that autonomously walks on the cell membrane to drive the cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot could move stepwise on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signal pathway regulation of desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular robots can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control the migration of a cell. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise move on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion and operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. We have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid synthesis of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and exploration of the polymerization mechanism are highly desired for the research of crystalline porous polymers, but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy to successfully prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs within 20 minutes for the first time. By in&#8208;situ imaging and time&#8208;dependent characterization, we proposed an ordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization mechanism for crystalline CTFs, in which the monomers rapidly polymerize into periodic 2D molecular sheets within 10 s and then grow into more ordered framework structures. Photocatalytic study of CTF with different crystallinity revealed that large crystalline domain could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, single&#8208;layer and few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets could be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit nearly fivefold improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate up to 7971 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is superior to most reported polymeric photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically&#8208;linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8211;Pd II intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. The transformation was scalable up to 1 mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn &#8208; carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by Pd II &#8208; catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of Pd(II) which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd(0) species. Once generated, Pd(0) triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordination group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides. A series of tertiary phosphine oxides were generated with up to 99% yield and 99.5% ee with wide functional group tolerances. Mechanistic studies reveal that (R)&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides preferentially interact with the cobalt catalysts to produce P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials to products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent 'ene&#8217;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. Here, we describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#120574; , &#120575; , &#120576; &#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies indicate that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes &#8211; indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism. Overall, this platform enables the development and optimization of photoenzymes for tailored applications in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;Dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement from the tetracyclic to the pentacyclic compound in the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin is very concise and only requires two redox enzymes. ChaZ mediates a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation to give a lactone intermediate. Subsequently, ChaE catalyses an unusual ketoreduction on an ester carbonyl group to give an acetal moiety, followed by a series of spontaneous reaction to construct the pentacyclic compound.







Abstract
Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type&#8197;II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early 13C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and affords the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner via tandem reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, oxidation and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8211;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a mononuclear manganese complex, synchronous e&#8722; and H+ transfer occurred by a concerted pathway from spatially distinct sites to the reaction center (see scheme). By virtue of the multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) mechanism, this model complex lowered the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to approximately 20&#8197;mV when the weak acid phenol was used as a proton source.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (H2ase) is preorganized with an amine (azadithiolate) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir, which together lower the overpotential for proton reduction and hydrogen oxidation by multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET). Herein, we report a mononuclear manganese complex, fac&#8208;[Mn(CO)3(6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (1), as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H2ase. In 1, a redox&#8208;active bidentate ligand with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in the enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle, in each of which an electron stored in the reductive ligand and a proton at the proximal phenol moiety are transferred to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex 1 exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natural enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant PEMFC Anodes Enabled by Synergistic Catalysis between Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Sites and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the synergistic effect between single&#8208;atom Ir sites and Ir nanoparticles, a novel CO&#8208;tolerating PEMFC anode catalyst (PEMFC=proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell) exhibits excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction and CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity. On this foundation, the catalyst can maintain a stable operation state in a H2/1000&#8197;ppm CO mixture.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are limited by their extreme sensitivity to trace&#8208;level CO impurities, thus setting a strict requirement for H2 purity and excluding the possibility to directly use cheap crude hydrogen as fuel. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in which a novel catalyst comprising both Ir particles and Ir single&#8208;atom sites (IrNP@IrSA&#8208;N&#8208;C) addresses the CO poisoning issue. The Ir single&#8208;atom sites are found not only to be good CO oxidizing sites, but also excel in scavenging the CO molecules adsorbed on Ir particles in close proximity, thereby enabling the Ir particles to reserve partial active sites towards H2 oxidation. The interplay between Ir nanoparticles and Ir single&#8208;atom centers confers the catalyst with both excellent H2 oxidation activity (1.19&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity (85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in PEMFCs; the catalyst also tolerates CO in H2/CO mixture gas at a level that is two times better than that of the current best PtRu/C catalyst.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are limited by their extreme sensitivity to trace-level CO impurities, thus setting a strict requirement for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purity and excluding the possibility to directly use cheap crude hydrogen as fuel. Herein, we report a proof-of-concept study, in which a novel catalyst comprising both Ir particles and Ir single-atom sites (Ir&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt;@Ir&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-N-C) addresses the CO poisoning issue. The Ir single-atom sites are found not only to be good CO oxidizing sites, but also excel in scavenging the CO molecules adsorbed on Ir particles in close proximity, thereby enabling the Ir particles to reserve partial active sites towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation. The interplay between Ir nanoparticles and Ir single-atom centers confers the catalyst with both excellent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation activity (1.19&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent CO electro-oxidation activity (85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in PEMFCs; the catalyst also tolerates CO in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO mixture gas at a level that is two times better than that of the current best PtRu/C catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Light&#8208;Activatable tRNA Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis methods using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond&#8208;breaking is an essential process in natural and synthetic chemical transformations. Accordingly, the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control, as historically evidenced in fields such as organic synthesis. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond&#8208;breaking to reticular materials, in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct, three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3&#8208;D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from a metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus, to the design and synthesis of countless new molecules and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Shearinines D and G: A Convergent Approach to Indole Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total syntheses of the indole diterpenoids (+)&#8208;shearinine G and (+)&#8208;shearinine D are disclosed. The successful routes rely on late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Formation of the challenging  trans  &#8208;hydrindane motif was accomplished by intramolecular diastereoselective cyclopropanation. A one&#8208;pot sequence consisting of Sharpless dihydroxylation/Achmatowicz reaction was developed to install the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif. The indenone subunit was accessed by Prins cyclization. Tuning the electronic nature of the substituents on the parent arylcarboxaldehyde allowed access to divergent products that were further transformed to shearinines G and D. En route to the various targets, Riley&#8208;type oxidation of a bicyclic enone yielded unexpected stereochemical surprises.</dc:description>

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization of nucleic acids in biology utilizes 5'nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates. The prebiotic availability of NTPs has been unresolved and other derivatives of nucleoside&#8208;monophosphates (NMPs) have been studied. However, this latter approach necessitates a change in chemistries when transitioning to biology. Herein we show that diamidophosphate (DAP), in a one&#8208;pot amidophosphorylation&#8208;hydrolysis setting converts NMPs to the corresponding NTPs via 5'&#8208;nucleoside amidophosphates (NaPs). The resulting crude mixture of NTPs are accepted by proteinaceous&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;polymerases as substrates for nucleic acid polymerization. This phosphorylation also operates at the level of oligonucleotides enabling ribozyme&#8208;mediated ligation. This one&#8208;pot protocol for simultaneous generation of NaPs and NTPs, suggests that the transition from prebioticphosphorylation and oligomerization to an enzymatic processivepolymerization can be more continuous than previously anticipated.</dc:description>

         <title>Five&#8208;fold Symmetric Pentaindolo&#8208; and Pentakis(benzoindolo)&#8208;Corannulenes: Unique Structural Dynamics Derived from the Combination of Helical&#8208; and Bowl&#8208;Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes bearing quintuple azahelicene units,  10  and  11  , were prepared and their dynamic behaviors were studied both experimentally and theoretically. The fused corannulenes were synthesized from  sym  &#8208;pentabromocorannulene in three steps, including Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;H arylation, and  N  &#8208;methylation. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis for  10  displayed a conformer possessing a  P(M)  bowl chirality and a  PPMPM  (  PMPMM  ) helical chirality, which was found to be the most stable conformer(s). Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements of  10  and  11  revealed that their structural isomers can be interconvertible in solution, depending on their steric congestion around the helical scaffolds. Automated search for conformers in the equilibrium and transition states by Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method revealed their interconversion networks, including bowl&#8208;inversion and helical&#8208;inversion, the activation barriers of which were estimated to be 2.6&#8211;3.6 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  and 9.8&#8211;26.9 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  , respectively. These values are smaller than those of the pristine corannulene (12.5 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  ) and the corresponding azahelicenes (22.0 and 35.3 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  ), respectively. This analysis indicated that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties influence the conformational dynamics, which leads to mitigation of the activation energy barriers for isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) Used for Target Specific Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Photooxygenation in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phototherapy has emerged as a powerful approach for interrupting &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) self&#8208;assembly. However, deeper tissue penetration and safer photosensitizers are urgent to be exploited for avoiding damaging nearby normal tissues and improving therapeutic effectiveness. A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II photooxygenation catalyst is presented here to settle the abovementioned challenges. By encapsulating the pyridinium hemicyanine dye DSM with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section in NIR&#8208;II window into the porphyrin&#8208;based HOF, the resultant DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 exhibits significant two&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;II&#8208;excited Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) for A&#946; oxidation. Further, the target peptides of KLVFFAED (KD8) are covalently grafted on DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 to enhance the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) permeability and A&#946; selectivity. The well&#8208;designed HOF&#8208;based photooxygenation catalyst shows an outstanding inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Further  in vivo  studies demonstrate the obvious decrease of craniocerebral A&#946; plaques and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD (3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD) model mice. Our present study provides new insights into the applications of HOFs as photo&#8208;therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Polycarbonates by Organocatalytic Copolymerization of CO2 and Epoxides: From High Pressure and Temperature to Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of  CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates (CO  2  &#8208;PCs), via ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO  2  and epoxides, is a promising way to solve two major challenges confronting sustainable society: greenhouse effect and white plastic pollution. The development of efficient catalysts is crucial for selective synthesis of CO  2  &#8208;PCs. However, conversion of CO  2  into CO  2  &#8208;PCs under ambient conditions (1 atm pressure and room temperature),  affording a more sustainable process that circumvents the energy&#8208;intensive process and reduces the high carbon&#8208;costs  , is still a great challenging task. In this contribution, organophosphazenes combined with triethylborane (TEB) were selected as binary organocatalyts for the copolymerization of CO  2  and epoxides. Both the activity and selectivity were highly dependent on the nature of phosphazenes.  2,4,6&#8208;  Tris[tri(1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)&#8208;iminophosphorane]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (C  3  N  3  &#8208;Py&#8208;P  3  ) with a relatively low basicity (p  K  a  = 26.5 in CD  3  CN) and a bulky molecular size (&#966; = 1.3 nm) exhibited an unprecedented efficiency (TON up to 12240) and selectivity (&gt;99% polymer selectivity and  &gt;99% carbonate linkages  ) toward copolymerization of CO  2  and cyclohexene oxide (CHO), and produced CO  2  &#8208;PCs with high molar masses (  M  n  s up to 275.5 kDa) at 1 MPa of CO  2  and 80 &#176;C. Surprisingly, this binary catalytic system achieved efficient CO  2  /CHO copolymerization with TOF up to 95 h  &#8208;1  at 1 atm pressure and room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Vitamin D   Inhibits the Early Aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and  Modulates Exocytosis Revealed by Electrochemical Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) localizes at presynaptic terminal and modulates synaptic functions.  Increasing evidence demonstrate that &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, forming at the early of aggregation, are cytotoxic and is thus related to brain neurodegenerative diseases.  Herein, we find that Vitamin D (VD) can reduce neurocytotoxicity. The reduced neurocytotoxicity might be attributed to the less amount of large&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers inhibited by VD, measured by electrochemical collision at single particle level, which are not observable with traditionally ensembled method.  Single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) results show that VD can recover the amount of  neurotransmitter release during exocytosis induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers  , further verifying the neuroprotection of VD. Our study reveals the neuroprotective role of VD through inhibiting &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, which is envisioned to be of great importance in treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavable Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes:&#160; Fast Release with Spatiotemporal Control in Inner Leaflets of Plasma Membrane, Nuclear Envelope, and Secretory Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanosensitive flipper probes are attracting interest as fluorescent reporters of membrane order and tension in biological systems. We here introduce PhotoFlippers which contain a photocleavable linker and an ultralong tether between mechanophore and various targeting motifs. Upon irradiation, the original probe is released and labels the most ordered membrane that is accessible by intermembrane transfer. Spatiotemporal control from photocleavable flippers is essential to access open, dynamic or elusive membrane motifs without chemical or physical interference. For instance, fast release with light is shown to place the original small&#8208;molecule probes into the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope to image changes in membrane tension, at specific points in time of membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway, or in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to explore membrane asymmetry. These results identify PhotoFlippers as useful chemistry tools to enable research in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Sortase mediated multi&#8208;fragment assemblies by ligation site switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a powerful tool of protein chemistry allowing the ligation of peptides containing LPxTG sorting motifs and N&#8208;terminal glycine nucleophiles. The installation of a sorting motif into the product prohibits the assembly of multiple fragments by SML. Here we report multi&#8208;fragment SML based on switchable sortase substrates. Substitution of the Leu residue by disulfide containing Cys(StBu) results in active sorting motifs, which are inactivatable by reduction. In combination with a photo&#8208;protected N&#8208;Gly nucleophile multi&#8208;fragment SML is enabled by repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept four&#8208;fragment ligation, the assembly of peptide probes for bivalent chromatin binding proteins and oligomerization of peptide antigens. Biochemical and immuno&#8208;assays demonstrated functionality of these probes rendering them promising tools for immunology and chromatin biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Pd(I) Dimer enabled Remote Functionalization: Access to Fluorinated 1,1&#8208;Diaryl Alkanes with Unprecedented Speed</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10 min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable Pd(I) dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy  2  t  Bu)]  2  , which in contrast to its P  t  Bu  3  counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes. Our combined experimental and computational studies rationalize the origins of switchability, which is primarily due to differences in dispersion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>EATA Reaction Catalyzed by Copper Halides of Mixed Oxidation States and Its Application to Total Synthesis of Scorodonin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring conjugated allenynes are of general interest to the scientific community for their potent and various biological activities. The 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines would be one of the most straightforward yet challenging approach to this class of compounds since it may, in principle, form two regioisomeric products involving two different C&#8208;C triple bonds. Herein, a catalytic recipe of copper halides with mixed oxidation states, i.e., CuCl/CuBr  2  , has been identified to address the issues of the side reaction of conjugate addition and the selectivity of 1,5&#8208;H transfer of the key intermediate, alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines, in EATA (Enantioselective Allenation of Terminal Alkynes) reaction involving the conjugated 2&#8208;alkynals. This protocol could accommodate a wide range of functional groups providing a series of allenynes with a very high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). In addition, the enantioenriched allenynes can be readily transformed into various building blocks and applied to the highly enantioselective total synthesis of linear allenic natural product  scorodonin  for the first time. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations elucidated the high regioselectivity for observed 1,5&#8208;H transfer within the intermediate of 1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines. The calculated energy difference between two of the most stable transition states of 3.4 kcal/mol accounts for a selectivity of over 99:1, which is in perfect agreement with the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Density&#8208;Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation&#8208;Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving full&#8208;color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density&#8208;dependent emission colors from a single boron&#8208;containing chromophore, from which multi&#8208;color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originated from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and also strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. Therefore, the chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full&#8208;color emitting materials, of which the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. More interestingly, the emission colors from these polyurethanes could also be modulated via physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non&#8208;emitting ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar Urea: Towards a Sustainable Fertilizer Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea, an agricultural fertilizer, nourishes humanity. The century&#8208;old Bosch&#8208;Meiser process provides the world&#8217;s urea. It is multi&#8208;step, consumes enormous amounts of non&#8208;renewable energy, and has a large CO  2  footprint. An eco&#8208;friendly synthesis for urea is a priority. Herein we report a single&#8208;step Pd/LTA&#8208;3A catalyzed synthesis of urea from CO  2  and NH  3  under ambient conditions, powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH  3  and providing the photothermal driving force for&#160;urea formation, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H  2  O, shifting the equilibrium towards urea production. The solar urea conversion rate from NH  3  and CO  2  is 87 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . This advance represents a first step towards the use of solar energy in urea production. It provides insights into green fertilizer production, and inspires the vision of sustainable, modular plants for distributed production of urea on farms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A molecular design to high&#8208;performance red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) emitters remains demanding. Herein a series of dinuclear platinum(II) complexes featuring strong intramolecular Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions has been developed by using N&#8208;deprotonated &#945;&#8208;carboline as a bridging ligand. The complexes in doped thin films exhibit efficient red to NIR emissions from short&#8208;lived (&#964; = 0.9&#8722;2.1 &#956;s) triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Red OLEDs demonstrated high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 23.3% among the best Pt(II) complexes&#8208;doped devices. The maximum EQE of 15.0% and radiance of 285 W sr&#8208;1 m&#8208;2 for NIR OLED (&#955;EL = 725 nm) are unprecedented for devices based on discrete molecular emitters. Both red and NIR devices show very small efficiencies roll&#8208;off at high brightness. Appealing operational lifetimes have also been revealed for the devices. This work sheds light on the potential of intramolecular metallophilicity for long wavelength molecular emitters and electroluminescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization of heteroarenes is of considerable importance for streamlining the rapid modification of bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a general strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation at the C4 position of pyridines with high site selectivity using various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. In this process, hydrogen atom transfer between the generated sulfonamidyl radicals and O&#8208;H bonds of cyclopropanols generates &#946;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, providing efficient access to synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridylated (aryl)ketones, aldehydes, and esters with broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilanes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiopure monohydrosilanes are versatile chiral reagents for alcohol resolution and mechanistic investigation. Herein, we have demonstrated the asymmetric synthesis of monohydrosilanes via an intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic monohydrosilanes, including a class of chiral oxa&#8208;silacycles, with excellent diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and enantioselectivities.&#160; Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1 mol% which represents one of the most efficient method to access chiral monohydrosilanes. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation indicate this Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction might undergo a Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism, and the enantio&#8208;determining step was predicted to be oxidative addition of Si&#8211;H bond</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Allenation of Terminal Alkynes with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(SIPr)NTf2 has been identified for the room temperature ATA reaction to afford diverse 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline as amine and aldehyde and TFE or HFIP as the mediator. A formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine and synthetic transformations have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed room temperature allenation of terminal alkynes (ATA) with aldehydes affording 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with diverse functional groups has been developed by identifying a gold(I) catalyst and an amine. The practicality of this reaction has been demonstrated by a ten gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the synthetic potentials have been demonstrated via various transformations and formal total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the gold catalyst, the aldehyde effect, the fluoroalkyl hydroxyl solvent (TFE or HFIP) and the structure of amine are vital in this room temperature ATA reaction.

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles could be instantaneously synthesized in a continuous way by a facile and universal strategy with the aid of high gravity intensification technology. This approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs. The as&#8208;prepared ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for the Knoevenagel reaction.







Abstract
Ultrasmall metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94&#8201;% or 75&#8201;% compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly unified, straightforward method of direct sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;P bond functionalization has been developed to access a variety of synthetically and highly useful bioactive benzhydrylamine, benzhydrylthioether, and triarylmethane motifs from commercially available arenes and simple aldehydes.







Abstract
Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8722;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8722;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8722;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs that are present in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anticancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Electron Localization and Lattice Strain Induced by Surface Lithium Doping Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Formate from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped SnLi catalyst prepared by controlled electrochemical lithiation presented an outstanding partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of formate production, due to the local electron localization and lattice strain on the Sn surface. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed a high power density and an excellent stability of &gt;800 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, with a partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt;800 cycles. Our work suggests a promising approach to incorporate electron localization and lattice strain for the catalytic sites to achieve efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance 3D K+&#8208;Pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene for Potassium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors via Regulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene with a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formed on its surface was employed as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors with high power density and superior cycling stability. This work offers a new insight into design of MXene&#8208;based anode material and the relationship between solvation structure and SEI formation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. A three&#8208;dimensional K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene with enlarged interlayer distance was constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K+&#8208;Ti3C2Tx//activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) were assembled, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene&#8208;based anode materials in energy storage devices.

&lt;/sub&gt;-MXene with a thin and inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formed on its surface was employed as an anode material for potassium-ion hybrid capacitors with high power density and superior cycling stability. This work offers a new insight into design of MXene-based anode material and the relationship between solvation structure and SEI formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-performance anode materials for potassium-based energy storage devices with long-term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. A three-dimensional K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pre-intercalated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; MXene with enlarged interlayer distance was constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium-ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether-based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pre-intercalated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;//activated carbon (AC) potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) were assembled, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene-based anode materials in energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the fungal ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide phomopsin was elucidated by gene inactivation experiments. Notably, chlorination by tyrosinase&#8208;like enzyme PhomQ1 and desaturation of amino acid moieties by UstYa family (DUF3328) proteins PhomYc/Yd/Ye were uncovered. Besides the known function of UstYa homologues, this study unveiled the remarkable functional diversity of these fungi&#8208;specific proteins.







Abstract
UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin&#8197;A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Evaluation of Treatment Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated photocathodic nanotool was fabricated for dual&#8208;functional intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of cellular oxidative stress in single live cell.







Abstract
With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, as well as precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on a nanowire array substrate. Compared to 2D thin films, the Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film shows one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD and fastest response speed among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.

         <title>Synergetic Cobalt&#8208;Copper&#8208;Based Bimetal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoboxes toward Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;copper&#8208;based conductive bimetal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) have been synthesized as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst, through a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the bimetallic synergetic effect and the well&#8208;designed hollow architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust long&#8208;term stability toward efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high turnover frequency value of 0.326&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#8197;mV. In combination of quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8722;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers from Amphiphilic Phosphodiester&#8208;Linked Azobenzene Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) of amphiphilic oligomers in aqueous medium is presented. Azobenzene&#8208;derived oligophosphates undergo morphological transformation upon light&#8208;triggered isomerization. In a reversible process, sheet&#8208;like SPs are switched to toroid&#8208;shaped objects by changing the configuration of the building blocks.

An amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimer has been exploited in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers. The trimer can reversibly undergo thermal and photoisomerization between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers. Its self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous medium have been investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, demonstrating that E&#8208; and Z&#8208;azobenzene trimers form supramolecular nanosheets and toroidal nanostructures, respectively. By virtue of the E/Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, the two different supramolecular morphologies can be switched by photoirradiation. The findings pave a way towards stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers which hold great promise in the development of smart functional materials.

&lt;p&gt;The assembly of stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) of amphiphilic oligomers in aqueous medium is presented. Azobenzene-derived oligophosphates undergo morphological transformation upon light-triggered isomerization. In a reversible process, sheet-like SPs are switched to toroid-shaped objects by changing the configuration of the building blocks.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molybdenum pincer for N2&#8208;splitting and functionalization is reported. The N2&#8208;cleavage affords a molybdenum nitrido complex and proceeds in the presence of a coordinated alkyne, that is, in the presence of a weaker C&#8801;C bond. The spatially and rotational restricted alkyne moiety is also tolerated during N&#8208;functionalization of the former nitrido complex.







Abstract
A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform comprising a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular dinitrogen. The coordinated &#951;2&#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this reduction. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via an initially generated terminal N2&#8208;complex, which is converted to a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;(&#951;1:&#951;1)&#8208;N2&#8208;bridged intermediate prior to N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Protonation, alkylation and acylation of the resulting molybdenum nitrido complex led to the corresponding N&#8208;functionalized imido complexes. Upon oxidation of the N&#8208;acylated imido derivative in MeCN, a fumaronitrile fragment was built up via C&#8722;C coupling of MeCN to afford a dinuclear molybdenum complex. The key finding that the strong N&#8801;N bond may be cleaved in the presence of a weaker, but spatially constrained C&#8801;C bond contradicts the widespread paradigm that coordinated alkynes are in general more reactive than gaseous N2.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with NHC&#8208;stabilized copper(I) homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols is developed that affords &#947;&#8208;chiral ketones in excellent regio&#8208; and high enantioselectivities. This process enables the generation of chiral quaternary carbon centers and features a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition Metal&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8208;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8208;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8208;Si) and carbon&#8208;boron (C&#8208;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8208;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8208;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as Absorber for Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their applicability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this article, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in terms of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation) and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). All these discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Truly&#8208;biocompatible gold catalysis enables vivo&#8208;orthogonal intra&#8208;CNS release of anxiolytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being recognized as the best&#8208;tolerated of all metals, the catalytic potential of gold (Au) has thus far been hindered by the ubiquitous presence of thiols in organisms. Herein we report the development of a truly&#8208;catalytic Au&#8208;polymer composite by assembling ultrasmall Au&#8208;nanoparticles at the protein&#8208;repelling outer layer of a co&#8208;polymer scaffold  via  electrostatic loading. Illustrating the  in vivo  &#8208;compatibility of the novel catalysts, we show their capacity to uncage&#160;the anxiolytic agent fluoxetine at the central nervous system (CNS) of developing zebrafish, influencing their swim pattern. This bioorthogonal strategy has enabled &#8213;for the first time&#8213; modification of cognitive activity by releasing a neuroactive agent directly in the brain of an animal.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying intracellular single vesicular catecholamine concentration with open carbon nanopipettes to unveil the effect of L&#8208;DOPA on vesicular structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis is essential for uncovering the pathologies of neuronal disorders and developing related pharmaceuticals. In this work intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) measurements with different&#8208;sized (50&#8208;500 nm radius) open carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) were performed to quantify the vesicular content and release kinetics of specific vesicle populations grouped by orifice sizes. Intracellular vesicles with radius below 100 nm were captured and narrowed between 50 and 100 nm. On the basis of this, single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were quantified as 0.23&#8208;1.1 M. Our results with L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;exposure indicate that L&#8208;DOPA regulates exocytosis by increasing the dense core size and vesicular content while catecholamine concentrations didn&#8217;t show obvious alterations. These were all achieved simultaneously and relatively noninvasively with open CNPs, and this methodology is applicable to the mechanistic study of the drugs in exocytosis modulation inside single cells as well as small living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable isotope phosphate labelling of diverse metabolites is enabled by a family of 18O&#8208;phosphoramidites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable isotope labelling is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in quantitative mass spectrometry, yet often accessing the required standards is cumbersome and very expensive. Here, a unifying synthetic concept for&#160;18O&#8208;labelled phosphates is presented, based on a family of modified&#160;18O2&#8209;phosphoramidite reagents. This toolbox offers access to major classes of biologically highly relevant phosphorylated metabolites as their isotopologues including nucleotides, inositol phosphates, &#8208;pyrophosphates, and inorganic polyphosphates.&#160;18O&#8208;enrichment ratios &gt;95% and good yields are obtained consistently in gram&#8208;scale reactions, while enabling late&#8208;stage labelling. We demonstrate the utility of the&#160;18O labelled inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates by assignment of these metabolites from different biological matrices. We demonstrate that phosphate neutral loss is negligible in an analytical setup employing capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO  2  radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or  &#945;  &#8208;chloro&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against  Bursaphelenchus xylophilus  and  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  .</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8230;X Halogen Bond&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogen bond is the attractive interaction between the electrophilic region of a halogen atom and the nucleophilic region of another molecular entity, emerging as a favorable manner to manipulate supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assemblies.  Engineering halogen bonded helical structures remains major challenges due to its sensitivity to solvent polarity and competitive forces like hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a  X  &#8230;X (X = Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bond that induces the formation and evolution of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylalanine derivatives with F, Cl, Br and I substitution self&#8208;assembled into 2  1  helical packing driven by hydrogen bond and halogen bond respectively. The specific molecular geometries of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids gave rise to multiple noncovalent forces to stabilize the X&#8230;X halogen bond with small bond energies ranging from &#8208;0.69 to &#8208;1.49 kcal/mol. Halogen bond induced an opposite helicity compared to the fluorinated species, accompanied by the inversed circularly polarized luminescence. The halogen bond could further engineer the helical nanoarchitectures in the mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;component coassemblies with melamine, providing a flexible protocol to prepare chiral functional materials. This work unveils the effect of weak X&#8230;X type halogen bonds on controlling supramolecular chirality in solid and solution state and offers a strategy to design halogenated chiral functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Singlet Carbenes as Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple experimental procedure for scaling carbene Br&#248;nsted basicity is described. The results highlight the strong basicity of pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA). They are more basic (pK  a  &gt; 42.7 in acetonitrile) than the popular proazaphosphatrane Verkade bases, and even the Schwesinger phosphazene superbase P  4  (  t  Bu). The basicity of these compounds can readily be tuned, and they are accessible in multigram quantities. These results open new avenues for carbon centered superbases.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing the MXene by Hydration Chemistry in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes attract great interest in diverse fields but suffer from fast structural degradation by attacking of dissolved oxygen and water molecules in aqueous solution. This drawback fundamentally hinders the long&#8208;term storage, applications and understanding of the chemical nature of MXenes. Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable way for long&#8208;term storage of MXenes in aqueous solution by hydration chemistry of nontoxic inorganic salts with abundant reserve. The attacking of MXene by free water and dissolved oxygen molecules is effectively inhibited by decreasing the water activity, which simultaneously lowers the dissolved oxygen concertation, of saline solution. As a result, the storage life of MXene can be dramatically prolonged to up to 400 days at ambient conditions without loss of intrinsic surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties. Over 90 % of salt protectant can be recycled by simply evaporating the final waste liquor after fully extracting the MXene to minimize the waste discharge and processing cost. This work offers an immediately commercializable approach with high cost&#8208;effectiveness, processing sustainability and environmental benefit for extending the shelf life of MXenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A defective nanotube molecule of C552H496N24&#160;with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 3&#8208;nm molecule comprised of a cylindrical core and cross&#8208;shaped rims was designed and synthesized by developing a modular synthetic route. By using a cyclic precursor from previous studies as a starting material, multiple carbazole units were installed at the rims of the defective cylinder. The defective cylinder was synthetically doped with two types of nitrogen atoms,&#160;  i.e.  , pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, which resulted in solvatochromic shifts in fluorescence via charge&#8208;transfer interactions. The structure of the large, C  552  H  496  N  24  &#160;molecule was fully disclosed by crystallographic analyses, and the unique helical arrangement of nitrogen&#8208;doped cylinders in the crystal was revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes via Cooperative Cu and Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a dual copper and nickel catalytic system with a silyl hydride source for promoting the linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes. This carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming protocol is applied to couple a variety of functionalized vinylarenes together with alkyl halides applying a nickel(II) NNN pincer complex in the presence of an NHC&#8208;ligated copper catalyst. This combination allows for just a 1 mol% loading of the nickel catalyst leading to turnover numbers of up to 72. Over 40 examples are presented, including applications for pharmaceutical diversification. Labeling experiments demonstrated the regioselectivity of the reaction and revealed that the copper catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate for formation of the reactive linear alkyl nickel complex. Overall, the presented work provides a complimentary approach for hydroalkylation reactions, whilst providing preliminary mechanistic understandings of the cooperativity between the copper and nickel complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipments, harsh conditions and hazardous media. The capability of living beings to accomplish this purpose using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures or nanocellulose are increasingly being synthesized through living entities. Even more, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. The focus of this Minireview is to present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is at reach through this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Aromaticity and Application of peri&#8208;PentacenoPentacene: Localized Representation of Benzenoid Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of TIPS&#8208;  peri  &#8208;pentacenopentacene (  TIPS&#8208;PPP  ), a vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;pentacene (  TIPS&#8208;PEN  ), a low band gap material with remarkable stability. We found the synthetic conditions to avoid the competition between 1,2 and 1,4&#8208;addition of lithium&#8208;acetylide on large aromatic dione. The high stability of  TIPS&#8208;PPP  is due to the  peri  &#8208;fusion which increases the aromaticity by generating two localized aromatic sextets that are flanked with 2 diene fragments similar to two fused&#8208;anthracenes. Like  TIPS&#8208;PEN  ,  TIPS&#8208;PPP  shows the archetypal 2D&#8208;brickwall motif in the crystals with stronger transfer integral and lower reorganization energies. The high mobility of up to 1 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  was obtained in OFET fabricated by wet process. Also,  TIPS&#8208;PPP  was used as a near&#8208;infrared emitter for NIR&#8208;OLED devices resulting in high external quantum efficiency at 800 nm. Based on literature data, NICS and the pattern of the HOMO molecular orbital, we highlight some key issues related to a localized representation of fused benzenoid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Targeting of Ibrutinib: Introducing Electrostatic Antibody&#8208;Inhibitor Conjugates (AiCs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have significantly improved treatment of patients with different malignancies, but their utilization can be compromised by unintended toxicities. Ibrutinib is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class covalent inhibitor of the Bruton&#180;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom&#8217;s macroglobulinemia and is connected with toxicities, caused by high dosage. To minimize toxicities of ibrutinib we linked ibrutinib to a cell&#8208;targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly&#8208;anionic derivate of ibrutinib, ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5 that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti&#8208;CD20&#8208;protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its physiological effectivity.  In vivo  , we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and a significantly better response to significantly lower doses compared to the original untargeted drug  . This combination of a cell&#8208;determining antibody, electrostatically connected to a molecular targeted inhibitor defines a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibody&#8208;inhibitor conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>The aryne phosphate reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensed phosphates are a critically important class of molecules in biochemistry, with a myriad of derived structures being known. Moreover, non&#8208;natural analogues are important for various applications, such as single molecule real time DNA sequencing. Often, such analogues contain more than three phosphate units in their oligophosphate chain. Consequently, investigations into phosphate reactivity enabling new ways of phosphate functionalization and oligophosphorylation are an essential endeavour in the field. Here, we scrutinize the potential of phosphates to act as arynophiles, paving the way for follow&#8208;up oligophosphorylation reactions. The aryne phosphate reaction is a powerful tool to &#8211; depending on the perspective &#8211; (oligo)phosphorylate arenes or arylate (oligo&#8208;cyclo)phosphates. Based on Kobayashi&#8208;type o&#8208;silylaryltriflates, the aryne phosphate reaction enables rapid entry into a broad spectrum of arylated products, like monophosphates, diphosphates, phosphodiesters and polyphosphates. The synthetic potential of these new transformations is demonstrated by efficient syntheses of nucleotide analogues and an unprecedented one&#8208;flask octaphosphorylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acidic PtIr Multipods Enable High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics concomitant with the high overpotentials and parasitic reactions from cathodes and solvents is the major challenge in aprotic lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries. Designing efficient catalysts for accelerating oxygen reaction kinetics is critical to develop high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Herein, the PtIr multipods with low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt since Pt has higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in lower Lewis acidity of Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on PtIr surface entails high electron density and down&#8208;shifting of d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards the intermediates (LiO  2  ), which is the key in achieving low oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li&#8208;O  2  cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low discharge/charge overall overpotential of (0.44 V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Borylation of C(sp2)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8210;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8208;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl,  N  &#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(  i  &#8208;Pr)  2  P&#8594;BBr  2  +  species.</dc:description>

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombinant virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from  Leviviridae  virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye, thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were rapidly captured by VLPs up to approximately 50% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8208;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8208;120 hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple and powerful method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules from nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthesis of functional 3D COFs with irreversible bond is challenging. Herein, 3D imide&#8208;bonded COFs were constructed via the imidization reaction between phthalocyanine&#8208;based tetraanhydride and 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantine. These two 3D COFs are made up of interpenetrated pts networks according to powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption analyses. CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 doped with carbon black has been employed to fabricate the electrocatalytic cathode towards CO2 reduction reaction within KHCO3 aqueous solution, displaying the Faradaic efficiency of 88&#8722;96% for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at the voltage range of &#8722;0.60~&#8722;1.00 V (vs. RHE). In particular, the 3D porous structure of CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 enables the active electrocatalytic centers occupying 32.7% of total cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits, thus giving a large current density (jCO) of &#8722;31.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.90 V. These two parameters are significantly improved than the excellent 2D COF analogue (CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;1, 5.1%&amp;21.2 mA).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chirality: A mine for catalysis and structure discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, exploited by Nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of protocols able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists to exploit their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methodologies reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional protocols that are expected to come in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination Reactions by a Formal C&#8209;H Functionalization/Defluorination Reaction with Diazoacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photolysis of diazoalkanes to conduct singlet carbene transfer reactions of colored diazoalkanes has recently attracted significant interest in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a photocatalytic approach that allows the access of triplet carbene intermediates via energy transfer to conduct highly efficient gemdifluoroolefination reactions with  &#945;  &#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. The use of a tertiary amines proved pivotal to unlock this unusual reaction pathway and to prevent undesired cyclopropanation pathways. The amine further facilitates the ultimate abstraction of fluoride to yield gem&#8208;difluoroolefins (43&#160;examples, up to 88% yield), which is supported by experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies. We explored this synthesis method with a broad substrate scope, ranging from simple olefins and heterocyclic olefins towards the decoration of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of Atomically Dispersed Zn Electrocatalyst by Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurately regulating the selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization but challenging. Herein, a flexible alteration of oxygen reduction pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity oxygen reduction can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O, C coordinated (ZnO  3  C) or N coordinated (ZnN  4  ) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOFs precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN  4  catalyst processes a 4e  &#8208;  pathway ORR to generate H  2  O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO  3  C catalyst with unique O, C coordination processes a 2e  &#8208;  pathway oxygen reduction to generate H  2  O  2  with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1 M KOH. Density functional theory calculations manifests that the decreased electron attribution around Zn in ZnO  3  C lower shifts the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2e  &#8208;  ORR. In virtue of the structure merits of MOFs, this work rationally designed and synthesized single Zn atoms with varied coordination environment towards different oxygen reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined precursor engineering and grain anchoring leading to MA&#8208;free, phase&#8208;pure and stable &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide perovskites for efficient solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) has become one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to their outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we first report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare MA&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. Engineering the precursor solutions by incorporating volatile FA&#8208;based additives completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized by permeating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzylammonium iodide into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is among one of the highest values to date. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained ~90% of their initial efficiency after storing at 50 &#176;C for over 1600 hours. These findings should open new routes towards fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of new application&#8208;forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8208;S batteries that can overcome the drawbacks like low&#8208;conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host&#8208;materials (mostly ~20 to ~40 wt% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable or high energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as micro&#8208;additives of binders (~1 wt% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow&#8208;tubes have been prepared as model micro&#8208;additives. The micro&#8208;additives can strengthen the basic properties of binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium&#8208;polysulfides as proved by the density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode. Correlating the COFs with their high functionality and porosity, as well as their new application&#8208;forms of micro&#8208;additives with boosted performances, could provide new insights to conquer the fundamental challenges in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinitiated anti&#8208;Hydropentafluorosulfanylation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinitiated  anti  &#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF  5  Cl and (TMS)  3  SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported. This transformation generates selectively (  Z  )  &#8208;  (1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;  6  &#8208;sulfanes (  Z:E  : &gt;85:15), thus allowing the preparation of this previously unknown geometrical isomer. DFT calculations highlight that the selectivity is due to the intrinsic preference of SF  5  &#8208;substituted vinylic radicals to adopt a  cis  geometry, and to increased steric contacts during the transition structures leading to the minor (  E  )&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent and Modular Synthesis of Terpenoid Scaffolds via a Au(I) Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot cascade sequence to generate synthetically challenging polycyclic scaffolds is reported utilizing a novel Lewis acid gold catalyst for the key cyclization step, enabling the divergent synthesis of both 6,6,5 tricyclic and 6,6,6,5 tetracyclic cores through both ligand and reaction condition control. We have combined the intrinsic complexity and stereoselectivity of cycloadditions with the electronic and steric properties of gold complexes to selectively generate complex polycyclic scaffolds in a single operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Spatial Designed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy transfer process (EnT) to elongate the charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce the self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H  4  TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8209;benzoic acid)pyrene (H  4  TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, these donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process, as well as high degree of site isolation. Two templates, the donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor&#8208;NS, and the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor&#8208;NS catalysts were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to their site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts. This research provides a potential direction to guide future photocatalyst designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Triggers Fluoroalkylation: Nucleophilic Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation with DBBF and CsF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF  3  )  3  C  &#8722;  species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;  tert  butylated product  3t  was successfully applied in  1  H&#8208; and  19  Fmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Polymer Cyclization via Supramolecular Confinement of Cyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of cyclic polymers has received much attention in polymer chemistry field. Although photochemical cycloaddition of terminal &#960;&#8208;bonded units provides a plausible way toward cyclic polymerization, it remains challenging to avoid side reactions by manipulating photochemical selectivity. Herein supramolecular confinement has been developed as a promising strategy to address this issue, by introducing highly directional hydrogen bonds to the photo&#8208;reactive cyanostilbenes. The cyanostilbenes units on both ends of a telechelic macromonomer are orientationally aligned with high local concentrations, yielding [2 + 2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition products upon 430 nm light irradiation. It leads to the formation of cyclic polymers in the self&#8208;assembled state, in stark contrast to Z&#8211;E isomerization of cyanostilbenes in the monomeric state. Overall, supramolecular confinement effect exemplified in the current study provides new avenues toward cyclic topological polymers with high synthetic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: shedding light on nano&#8208;bio interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8208;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for nano&#8208;bio interaction studies and allows for scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of the recent progress of FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8208;bio interfacing. By investigating various FNAs, we summarize their biological profiles and immune responses as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts of applying FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this mini&#8208;review can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNA and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of the majority of cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#949;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest. Rapid, operationally simple and tolerant to ambient atmosphere, we demonstrate the installation of a range of lysine (Lys) PTMs into model peptide systems and showcase the potential of this technology by site&#8208; selectively installing an N&#949;Ac sidechain into recombinantly expressed ubiquitin (Ub).</dc:description>
