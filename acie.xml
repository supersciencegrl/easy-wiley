         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8211;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8211;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8211;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8211;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169 nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1180 nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50 &#181;m2, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic ipso&#8208;Nitration of Organosilanes Enabled by Electrophilic&#160;N&#8208;Nitrosaccharin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroaromatic compounds represent one of the essential classes of molecules that are widely used as feedstock for the synthesis of intermediates, the preparation of nitro&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials on both laboratory and industrial scales. We herein disclose the efficient, mild, and catalytic ipso&#8208;nitration of organotrimethylsilanes, enabled by an electrophilic N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagent and allows chemoselective nitration under mild reaction conditions, while exhibiting remarkable substrate generality and functional group compatibility. Additionally, the reaction conditions proved to be orthogonal to other common functionalities, allowing programming of molecular complexity via successive transformations or late&#8208;stage nitration. Detailed mechanistic investigation by experimental and computational approaches strongly supported a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism, which was found to proceed through a highly ordered transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzothiophene Sulfone&#8208;Based Ambipolar&#8208;Transporting Blue&#8208;Emissive Organic Semiconductors Towards Simple&#8208;Structured Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of blue&#8208;emissive ambipolar organic semiconductor is an arduous target due to the large energy gap, but is an indispensable part for electroluminescent device, especially for the transformative display technology of simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (SS&#8208;OLET). Herein, we designed and synthesized two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based high mobility blue&#8208;emissive organic semiconductors (DNaDBSOs), which demonstrate superior optical property with solid&#8208;state photoluminescent quantum yield of 46%&#8208;67% and typical ambipolar&#8208;transporting properties in SS&#8208;OLETs with symmetric gold electrodes. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal the natural of ambipolar property for such blue&#8208;emissive DNaDBSOs&#8208;based materials is ascribed to a synergistic effect on lowering LUMO level and reduced electron injection barrier induced by the interfacial dipoles effect on gold electrodes due to the incorporation of appropriate DBSO unit. Finally, efficient electroluminescence properties with high&#8208;quality blue emission (CIE (0.179, 0.119)) and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48 nm are achieved for DNaDBSOs&#8208;based SS&#8208;OLET, showing good spatial control of the recombination zone in conducting channel. This work provides a new avenue for designing ambipolar emissive organic semiconductors by incorporating the synergistic effect of energy level regulation and molecular&#8208;metal interaction, which would advance the development of superior optoelectronic materials and their high&#8208;density integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Relative Nitrogen Locations of Diazine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising candidates for the overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the effects of the relative nitrogen locations remain obscured and photocatalytic performances of COFs need to be further improved. Herein, a collection of COFs functionalized by various diazines including pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine have been judiciously designed and synthesized for photogeneration of H2O2 without sacrificial agents. Compared with pyrimidine and pyrazine, pyridazine embedded in TpDz tends to stabilize endoperoxide intermediate species, leading toward&#160;the more efficient direct 2e&#8209; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Benefiting from the effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and high&#8208;efficiency ORR pathway, an excellent production rate of 7327 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) value of 0.62% has been achieved by TpDz, which ranks one of the best COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work might shed fresh light on the rational design of functional COFs targeting photocatalysts in H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Direct Functionalization of Allylic sp3 C&#8211;H Bonds with Concomitant CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction integrated with C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming organic synthesis represents a substantially untapped opportunity to simultaneously tackle carbon neutrality and create an atom&#8208;/redox&#8208;economical chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the first cooperative photoredox catalysis of efficient and tunable CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with direct alkylation/arylation of unactivated allylic sp3 C&#8211;H bonds for accessing allylic C&#8211;C products, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atoms&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Our protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates, affording a broad of allylic C&#8211;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also produces syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (1:2&#8211;5:1). Such win&#8208;win coupling catalysis highlights the high atom&#8208;, step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economy, and good durability, illuminating the tantalizing possibility of a renewable sunlight&#8208;driven chemical feedstocks manufacturing industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Configuration Tuning of Centrally Extended Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the molecular optimizations of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), extending the central core can tune the energy levels, reduce nonradiative energy loss, enhance the intramolecular (donor&#8211;acceptor and acceptor&#8211;acceptor) packing, facilitate the charge transport, and improve device performance. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores. Among these, the acceptor&#160;CH&#8208;BBQ, embedded with benzobisthiadiazole, exhibited an optimal fibrillar network morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 18.94% for CH&#8208;BBQ&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs; 18.19% for binary OSCs) owing to its delicate structure design and electronic configuration tuning. Both experimental and theoretical approaches were used to systematically investigate the influence of the central electron&#8208;deficient core on the properties of the acceptor and device performance. The electron&#8208;deficient core modulation paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of NFAs, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Pure Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Ir(III) Complexes for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode (OLED) with External Quantum Efficiency Over 16%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters have significant applications in medical and optoelectronic fields, but the development stays a great challenge due to the energy gap law. Here, we report two NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes which display emission peaks around 730 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum of only 43 nm. Therefore, pure NIR luminescence can be obtained without having a very long emission wavelength, thus alleviating the restriction of the energy gap law, and obtaining impressively high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 0.70. More importantly, the pure NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) fabricated by the solution&#8208;processed mothed shows outstanding device performance with the highest external quantum efficiency of 16.43%, which sets a new record for solution&#8208;processed NIR&#8208;OLEDs based on different emitters. This work sheds light on the development of Ir(III) complexes with narrowband emissions as highly efficient pure NIR&#8208;emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic N&#8208;substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acids. Here, we use directed evolution to engineer the &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of L&#8208;serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;&#8208;substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a g&#8208;scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photovoltaic technology with low weight, high specific power in cold environments, and compatibility with flexible fabrication is highly desired for near&#8208;space vehicles and polar region applications. Herein, we demonstrate efficient low&#8208;temperature flexible perovskite solar cells by improving the interfacial contact between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer. We find that the adsorbed oxygen active sites and oxygen vacancies of flexible tin oxide (SnO2) ETL layer can be effectively decreased by incorporating a trace amount of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The effective defects elimination at the interfacial increases the electron mobility of flexible SnO2 layer, regulates band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, induces larger perovskite crystal growth, and improves charge collection efficiency in a complete solar cell. Correspondingly, the improved interfacial contact transforms into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with efficiencies up to 23.7% at 218 K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging flexible photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Furan&#8208;Based Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable furan&#8208;based n&#8208;type semiconductors were developed for organic solar cells. Important photodegradation mechanisms were revealed and analyzed and the findings lead to effective strategies to improve the photostability of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
We explore a series of furan&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and report their optoelectronic properties, solid&#8208;state packing, photodegradation mechanism and application in photovoltaic devices. Incorporating furan building blocks leads to the expected enhanced backbone planarity, reduced band gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of these acceptors. Still, their position in the molecule is critical for stability and device performance. We found that the photodegradation of these acceptors originates from two distinct pathways: electrocyclic photoisomerization and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of singlet oxygen. These mechanisms are of general significance to most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini leads to better photostability, well&#8208;balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker offers the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&gt;14&#8201;%), outperforming all furan&#8208;based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene&#8208;based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan&#8208;based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene&#8208;based photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Dearomatization of (Hetero)arenes through Photodriven Interplay between Polysulfide Anions and Formate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic protocol was developed for the dearomatization of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and related heteroaromatic compounds through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism induced by single&#8208;electron transfer from photoexcited polysulfide anions in the presence of methanol. The catalytic turnover is maintained by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between polysulfide radical anions and formate.







Abstract
The facile construction of C(sp3)&#8208;rich carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic compounds is a pivotal synthetic strategy to foster contemporary drug discovery programs. The downstream dearomatization of readily accessible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) planar arenes represents a direct pathway towards accessing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aliphatic scaffolds. Here, we demonstrate that polysulfide anions are capable of catalyzing a dearomatization process of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and other related heteroaromatic compounds in the presence of potassium formate and methanol under visible light irradiation. The developed protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the arene dearomatization.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral QUINAP Derivatives by Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ketone&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the enantioselective oxidation of N atoms was developed and effectively applied to the atroposelective kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs and related compounds. Both highly enantioenriched QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide products could be readily converted into QUINAPs without loss of chiral integrity. QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide was also shown to act as a chiral Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
QUINAPs have emerged as a pivotal class of axially chiral compounds with remarkable features in the stereoinduction of diverse enantioselective transformations. However, the confined substrate range and extravagant price still pose challenges, limiting their broader utilization. Herein, we describe the first atroposelective oxidation of an N atom using a chiral ketone catalyst, allowing the kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs to give both the unreacted substrates and their corresponding N&#8208;oxides with excellent enantioselectivity. Importantly, the enantioenriched products can be readily converted into the QUINAP targets without any loss of stereochemical integrity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that a dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of the ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogues of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.

         <title>Solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 Catalyzed by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are emerging and promising candidates in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Significant progress has developed in the past several years. However, comprehensive reviews on this specific field are lacking. This minireview presents an overview of the development of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production, highlighting the recent strategies to optimize COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The insights into the future development of industrial&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective H2O2 production are also offered.







Abstract
Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis in 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemicals not limited to H2O2.

         <title>Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization for the Modular Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Vinylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization for the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones. The catalysis system was achieved by means of asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis which afforded trisubstituted as well as E&#8208; and Z&#8208;tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively.







Abstract
Axially chiral N&#8208;substituted quinazolinones are important bioactive molecules, which are presented in many synthetic drugs. However, most strategies toward their atroposelective synthesis are mainly limited to the axially chiral arylquinazolinone frameworks. The development of modular synthetic methods to access diverse quinazolinone&#8208;based atropisomers remains scarce and challenging. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones via the strategy of asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization. The catalysis system utilized both asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis to efficiently afford trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively. With the meticulous design of &#946;&#8208;substituted allylic substrates, both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;tetrasubstituted axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones were obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can we realize thermodynamically unfavored chemical processes? The operating principles of molecular machines&#8212;ratchet mechanisms&#8212;can help answer this. This tutorial Review provides an overview that balances experimental examples with rationalizations, while detaching from directional motion. A unifying picture is offered for chemical&#8208;, light&#8208;, and redox&#8208;driven systems, highlighting connections with active transport and bioenergetics, among others.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type&#8212;rather than the application domain or energy source&#8212;we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.

An inorganic molecular crystalline Sb2O3 film with an ultrathin thickness of 10&#8197;nm serves as an effective protection layer for Zn anodes to enable uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed side reaction and tip growth effect, achieving a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10&#8197;nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72&#8197;h to 2800&#8197;h, in contrast to the 900&#8197;h of much thicker WO3 even in 100&#8197;nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.

         <title>Intermolecular Formal Cycloaddition of Indoles with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes by Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular formal cycloaddition of indoles with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes promoted by commercially available Lewis acids has been disclosed, allowing one&#8208;step rapid construction of rigid indoline polycyclic structures via a cascade nucleophilic addition and Mannich reaction process.







Abstract
Herein, we develop a new approach to directly access architecturally complex polycyclic indolines from readily available indoles and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) through formal cycloaddition promoted by commercially available Lewis acids. The reaction proceeded through a stepwise pathway involving a nucleophilic addition of indoles to BCBs followed by an intramolecular Mannich reaction to form rigid indoline&#8208;fused polycyclic structures, which resemble polycyclic indole alkaloids. This new reaction tolerated a wide range of indoles and BCBs, thereby allowing the one&#8208;step construction of various rigid indoline polycycles containing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Batrachotoxin Enabled by a Pd/Ag&#8208;Promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid. Its 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocyclic framework is functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered hemiacetal, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group. By a novel and simple convergent strategy involving Pd/Ag&#8208;promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and Dieckmann condensation reactions, the total synthesis of batrachotoxin was realized in 22 steps.







Abstract
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of frogs, birds, and beetles. The steroidal 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocycle (ABCD&#8208;ring) is U&#8208;shaped and functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered C3&#8208;hemiacetal across the AB&#8208;ring, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane on the CD&#8208;ring, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group at the D&#8208;ring carbon chain. These structural features present an unusual and formidable synthetic challenge. Herein we report a total synthesis of batrachotoxin based on a newly devised convergent strategy through a 22&#8208;step sequence. Enantiopure AB&#8208;ring and D&#8208;ring fragments were prepared and subjected to a crucial C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction. Although both C(sp2) centers were sterically encumbered by proximal tetrasubstituted carbon atoms, Ag2O strongly promoted the Pd(PPh3)4&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, thereby connecting the two fragments without damaging their preexisting functionalities. Subsequent treatment with t&#8208;BuOK induced Dieckmann condensation to cyclize the C&#8208;ring. The judiciously optimized functionalizations realized oxazepane formation, carbon chain extension, and pyrrole carboxylic acid condensation to deliver batrachotoxin.

         <title>Direct Acylation of Unactivated Alkyl Halides with Aldehydes through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehydes underwent cross&#8208;coupling with unactivated alkyl halides in the presence of an NHC organocatalyst, thus enabling the rapid synthesis of various ketones from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This method was also applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this organocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic acylation of organohalides with aldehydes is an ideal strategy for the direct synthesis of ketones. However, the utilization of unactivated alkyl halides in such a transformation remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we developed a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aldehydes with unactivated alkyl halides through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. With this protocol, various ketones could be rapidly synthesized from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This organocatalytic system was successfully applied in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Raman Lasing from Metal&#8208;Linked Organic Dimer Microcrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave Raman lasing is realized in a metal&#8208;linked organic dimer microcrystal. It has much enhanced Raman gain and notably improved stability. By virtue of the wide transparency window of the microcrystal, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering offers an alternative strategy to explore continuous&#8208;wave (c.w.) organic lasers, which, however, still suffers from the limitation of inadequate Raman gain in organic material systems. Here we propose a metal&#8208;linking approach to enhance the Raman gain of organic molecules. Self&#8208;assembled microcrystals of the metal linked organic dimers exhibit large Raman gain, therefore allowing for c.w. Raman lasing. Furthermore, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved in the organic dimer microcrystals by adjusting excitation wavelengths. This work advances the understanding of Raman gain in organic molecules, paving a way for the design of c.w. organic lasers.

         <title>Tuning C1/C2 Selectivity of CO2 Electrochemical Reduction over in&#8208;Situ Evolved CuO/SnO2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report a tuning C1/C2 selectivity of CO2 electrochemical reduction over in situ electrochemically evolved CuO/SnO2 heterostructure. Specifically, the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of the newly evolved Cu/SnO2&#8208;x facilitates ethanol generation.







Abstract
Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO2 under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO2ER product selectivity and the in situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8722;0.85&#8197;VRHE, the CuO/SnO2 evolves to Cu2O/SnO2 with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81&#8201;%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO2&#8208;x at &#8722;1.05&#8197;VRHE with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8&#8201;%. In situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO2&#8208;x favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we report a tuning C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemical reduction over in situ electrochemically evolved CuO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure. Specifically, the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of the newly evolved Cu/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates ethanol generation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemical reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER product selectivity and the in situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8722;0.85&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;, the CuO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolves to Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81&#8201;%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;1.05&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8&#8201;%. In situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A setup for wireless detection of early and mature microbial biofilms has been developed by combining inkjet printing of nanomaterials, chip&#8208;less antenna, and electrogenicity of biofilms. Wireless sensing relies on the biofilm ability to electro&#8208;reduce antenna integrated AgCl to Ag. Detection of medically relevant biofilms formed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated, aiming for wireless wound infection sensing in clinics.







Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8722;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.

Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis operates by stabilizing anionic transition states on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces. In anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis, &#960; stacks add polarizability to strengthen interactions. In search of synthetic methods to extend &#960; stacks beyond the limits of foldamers, the self&#8208;assembly of micelles from amphiphilic naphthalenediimides (NDIs) is introduced. To interface substrates and catalysts, charge&#8208;transfer complexes with dialkoxynaphthalenes (DANs), a classic in supramolecular chemistry, are installed. In &#960;&#8208;stacked micelles, the rates of bioinspired ether cyclizations exceed rates on monomers in organic solvents by far. This is particularly impressive considering that anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis in water has been elusive so far. Increasing rates with increasing &#960; acidity of the micelles evince operational anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis. At maximal &#960; acidity, autocatalytic behavior emerges. Dependence on position and order in confined micellar space promises access to emergent properties. Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles in water thus expand supramolecular systems catalysis accessible with anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with an inspiring topic of general interest and great perspectives.

         <title>Dynamically Restructuring NixCryO Electrocatalyst for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Real Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that can dynamically restructure itself during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and increase its porosity by Cr leaching. The enhancement of porosity improved electrolyte penetration and boosted electronic interaction between OH&#8722; and active sites, resulting in 2000, 275, and 100&#8197;h stability at 10, 100, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in real seawater.







Abstract
In the pursuit of long&#8208;term stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater, retaining the intrinsic catalytic activity is essential but has remained challenging. Herein, we developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that manifested exceptional OER stability in alkaline condition while improving the activity over time by dynamic self&#8208;restructuring. In 1&#8197;M KOH, NixCryO required overpotentials of only 270 and 320&#8197;mV to achieve current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, with excellent long&#8208;term stability exceeding 475&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 280&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The combination of electrochemical measurements and in situ studies revealed that leaching and redistribution of Cr during the prolonged electrolysis resulted in increased electrochemically active surface area. This eventually enhanced the catalyst porosity and improved OER activity. NixCryO was further applied in real seawater from the Red Sea (without purification, 1&#8197;M KOH added), envisaging that the dynamically evolving porosity can offset the adverse active site&#8208;blocking effect posed by the seawater impurities. Remarkably, NixCryO exhibited stable operation for 2000, 275 and 100&#8197;h in seawater at 10, 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The proposed catalyst and the mechanistic insights represented a step towards realization of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based direct seawater splitting.

         <title>A Chemoselective Polarity&#8208;Mismatched Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Enabled by Synergistic Boron Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Transition Metal Scaffolds for Targeted Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance, caused by persistent adaptation and growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to overprescribed antibiotics, poses one of the most serious and urgent threats to global public health. The limited pipeline of experimental antibiotics in development further exacerbates this looming crisis and new drugs with alternative modes of action is needed to tackle evolving pathogenic adaptation and mutation. Transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible by pure organic scaffolds. We spotlight four emerging strategies to harness these unique properties to develop new targeted antibacterial agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Potential Controllable Redox Couple for Mild and Efficient Lithium Recovery from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is dialectically accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries. It is an urgent priority to develop green and efficient battery recycling strategies for helping ease resources and environmental pressures at the current stage. Here, we propose a mild and efficient lithium extracting strategy based on potential controllable redox couple. Active lithium in the spent battery without discharging was extracted using a series of tailored aprotic solutions comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers. This ensures a safe yet efficient recycling process with nearly ~100% lithium recovery. We further investigate the Li+&#8208;electron concerted redox reactions and the effect of solvation structure on kinetics during the extraction, and broaden the applicability of the Li&#8208;PAHs solution. This work can stimulate new inspiration for designing novel solutions to meet efficient and sustainable demands in recycling batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene Formation or Reduction of the Diazo Functional Group? An Unexpected Solvent&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Cyclic Diazo Imides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;dependent light&#8208;assisted divergent reactivities of cyclic diazo imides and thiols have been disclosed. In dichloromethane, an indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidine is formed via triplet a carbene intermediate. By switching the solvent to acetonitrile, the aryl thiol acts as a reductant and leads to the reduction of the diazo functional group to a hydrazone.







Abstract
The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.

         <title>Promoting Solar&#8208;driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production over Thiazole&#8208;based Conjugated Polymers via Generating and Converting Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that singlet oxygen (1O2) can react with benzobisthiazole&#8208;based photocatalysts via [4+2] cycloaddition, leading to the formation of endoperoxide intermediate species, which promotes the separation of charge carriers and reduces the barrier for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The H2O2 production rate of the catalyst is as high as 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water in air.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air provides a low&#8208;cost and eco&#8208;friendly alternative route to the traditional anthraquinone method. Herein, four thiazole&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Tz&#8208;CPs: TTz, BTz, TBTz and BBTz) are synthesized via aldimine condensation. BBTz exhibits the highest H2O2 production rate of 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Further, the reaction path is analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) and theoretical calculation, highlighting the prominent role of singlet oxygen (1O2). The generation of 1O2 occurs through the oxidation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and subsequent conversion into endoperoxides via [4+2] cycloaddition over BBTz, which promotes charge separation and reduces the barrier for H2O2 production. This work provides new insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic O2 reduction and the molecular design of superior single&#8208;polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Thermodynamic Phase Transition of Three&#8208;Dimensional Solid Additives Guiding Molecular Assembly for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional solids were developed to optimize the nanoscale structure of the active layer in organic solar cells by offering ample assembly space during the phase&#8208;transition process, yielding a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 19&#8201;%. This research not only established a valuable pre&#8208;selection approach for solid additives but also deepened our understanding of the underlying working mechanism.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the thermodynamic self&#8208;assembly of molecules via volatile solid additives has emerged to be an effective way to construct high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Here, three&#8208;dimensional structured solid molecules have been designed and applied to facilitate the formation of organized molecular assembly in the active layer. By means of systematic theory analyses and film&#8208;morphology characterizations based on four solid candidates, we preselected the optimal one, 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline (FPA), which possesses good volatility and strong charge polarization. The three&#8208;dimensional solids can induce molecular packing in active layers via strong intermolecular interactions and subsequently provide sufficient space for the self&#8208;reassembly of active layers during the thermodynamic transition process. Benefitting from the optimized morphology with improved charge transport and reduced energy disorder in the FPA&#8208;processed devices, high efficiencies of over 19&#8201;% were achieved. The strategy of three&#8208;dimensional additives inducing ordered self&#8208;assembly structure represents a practical approach for rational morphology control in highly efficient devices, contributing to deeper insights into the structural design of efficient volatile solid additives.

Here, three-dimensional structured solid molecules have been designed and applied to facilitate the formation of organized molecular assembly in the active layer. By means of systematic theory analyses and film-morphology characterizations based on four solid candidates, we preselected the optimal one, 4-fluoro-&lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylaniline (FPA), which possesses good volatility and strong charge polarization. The three-dimensional solids can induce molecular packing in active layers via strong intermolecular interactions and subsequently provide sufficient space for the self-reassembly of active layers during the thermodynamic transition process.

         <title>Biomimetic Approach to Diverse Coral Diterpenes from a Biosynthetic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic biology enables the semisynthesis of numerous complex chemotypes starting from the soft coral metabolite klysimplexin R produced at at gram scale. This approach has the potential to provide diverse molecules for drug discovery and development using a green approach inspired by nature.







Abstract
Thousands of coral terpenes originate from simple scaffolds that undergo oxidative tailoring. While corals are excellent sources of drug leads, the challenge of supplying structurally complex drug leads from marine organisms has sometimes slowed their development. Making this even more challenging, in comparison to other organisms, such as plants and microbes, for which the terpene literature is substantial, very little is known about how the unique coral terpenes are biosynthesized and elaborated in nature. In this study, we used a semisynthetic strategy to produce at gram scale in yeast the eunicellane scaffold that underlies &gt;200 coral compounds. Synthetic oxidation reactions were explored, generating key scaffolds that reflect three of the four structural classes derived from eunicellane and enabling the first asymmetric syntheses of the natural products solenopodin C and klysimplexin Q. Biomimetic methods and detailed mechanistic studies of synthetic reactions shed light on potential enzymological reactivity, including the role of epoxide rearrangement in eunicellane biosynthesis.

         <title>Photothermal Conversion by Carbon Black Facilitates Aryl Migration by Photon&#8208;Promoted Temperature Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conversion enables thermal gradients that facilitate high activation barrier reactions, such as the Newman Kwart Rearrangement. Substrates normally requiring bulk temperatures &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C are easily converted via visible light irradiation with short reaction times. Wavelength and intensity tunability enable selective product formation.







Abstract
The Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR) offers an efficient and high&#8208;yielding method for producing substituted thiophenols from phenols. While an industrially important protocol, it suffers from high activation energy barriers (35&#8211;43&#8197;kcal/mol), requiring the use of extreme temperatures (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) and specialty equipment. This report details a highly efficient and straightforward method for facilitating the NKR using photothermal conversion. This underused, unique reactivity pathway arises from the irradiation of nanomaterials that relax via a non&#8208;radiative decay pathway to generate intense thermal gradients. We show carbon black (CB) can be an inexpensive and abundant photothermal agent under visible light irradiation to achieve a facile NKR under mild conditions. The scope includes a wide array of stereo&#8208; and electronically diverse substrates with increasing difficulty of rearrangement, including BHT and BINOL as effective substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the unique application for temporal control in a thermal reaction and tunability of thermal gradients by modulating light intensity. Ultimately, photothermal conversion enables high&#8208;temperature reactions with simple, visible light irradiation.

         <title>A Molecular Z&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System Under the Bias&#8208;Free Condition for CO2 Reduction Coupled with Two&#8208;electron Water Oxidation: Photocatalytic Production of CO/HCOOH and H2O2</title>

         <dc:description>
The molecular Z&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis with a photocathode of CO2 reduction and a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 by visible light as the only energy input was developed for the first time.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired molecular&#8208;engineered systems have been extensively investigated for the half&#8208;reactions of H2O oxidation or CO2 reduction with sacrificial electron donors/acceptors. However, there has yet to be reported a device for dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photoanodes coupled with molecular photocathodes in an aqueous solution without the use of sacrificial reagents. Herein, we will report the integration of SnIV&#8208; or AlIII&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (SnTPyP or AlTPyP) decorated tin oxide particles (SnTPyP/SnO2 or AlTPyP/SnO2) photoanode with the dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photocathode on nickel oxide particles containing [Ru(diimine)3]2+ as the light&#8208;harvesting unit and [Ru(diimine)(CO)2Cl2] as the catalyst unit covalently connected and fixed within poly&#8208;pyrrole layer (RuCAT&#8208;RuC2&#8208;PolyPyr&#8208;PRu/NiO). The simultaneous irradiation of the two photoelectrodes with visible light resulted in H2O2 on the anode and CO, HCOOH, and H2 on the cathode with high Faradaic efficiencies in purely aqueous conditions without any applied bias is the first example of artificial photosynthesis with only two&#8208;electron redox reactions.

         <title>Triple&#8208;function Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function eutectic electrolyte is designed by introducing tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) as hydrogen bond acceptor. The preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress dendrite growth. TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ to realize a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation situation, and the intercalated TMS remains in the cathode as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; to stabilize the structure.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZBs) are impeded by the mutual problems of unstable cathode, electrolyte parasitic reactions, and dendritic growth of zinc (Zn) anode. Herein, a triple&#8208;functional strategy by introducing the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) to form a hydrated eutectic electrolyte is reported to ameliorate these issues. The activity of H2O is inhibited by reconstructing hydrogen bonds due to the strong interaction between TMS and H2O. Meanwhile, the preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface increases the thickness of double electric layer (EDL) structure, which provides a shielding buffer layer to suppress dendrite growth. Interestingly, TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ ultimately to achieve a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation ((Zn&#8208;TMS)2+) mechanism, and the intercalated TMS works as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; that provides more zincophilic sites and stabilizes the structure of cathode (NH4V4O10, (NVO)). Consequently, the Zn||NVO battery exhibits a remarkably high specific capacity of 515.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 40&#8197;days. This multi&#8208;functional electrolytes and solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism will significantly propel the practical development of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Constructing Photoactivatable Protein with Genetically Encoded Photocaged Glutamic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged glutamic acid analogues are genetically encoded into proteins for the first time, opening up new opportunities for directly and effectively generating photoactivatable proteins.







Abstract
Genetically replacing an essential residue with the corresponding photocaged analogues via genetic code expansion (GCE) constitutes a useful and unique strategy to directly and effectively generate photoactivatable proteins. However, the application of this strategy is severely hampered by the limited number of encoded photocaged proteinogenic amino acids. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of photocaged glutamic acid analogues in E. coli and mammalian cells and demonstrate their use in constructing photoactivatable variants of various fluorescent proteins and SpyCatcher. We believe genetically encoded photocaged Glu would significantly promote the design and application of photoactivatable proteins in many areas.

         <title>Polymer Chainmail: Steric Hindrance and Charge Compensation of Anion&#8208;Doped PEDOT to Boost Stress Deformation of Compressible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films as &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; were modified by PF&#8722;6 anion doping, the ion adsorption and diffusion processes on the PEDOT chains were significantly optimized due to the steric hindrance and charge compensation effects, so the cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% after 20,000 cycles) and rate performance (retaining 81.1&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3) were improved.







Abstract
Conducting polymers with high theoretical capacitance and deformability are among the optimal candidates for compressible supercapacitor electrode materials. However, achieving both mechanical and electrochemical stabilities in a single electrode remains a great challenge. To address this issue, the &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; is proposed with reversible deformation capability and enhances stability because of the steric hindrance and charge compensation effect of doped anions. As a proof of concept, four common anions are selected as dopants for Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their effects on the adsorption and diffusion of H+ on PEDOT are verified using density functional theory calculations. Owing to the film formation effect, the 
 doped PEDOT/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon foam exhibits good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and stability due to suitable anion doping. This finding provides new insights into the preparation of electrochemically stable conductive polymer&#8208;based compressible electrode materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorinative Bifunctionalization of Aziridines and Azetidines with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines with gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is disclosed via Pd catalysis for the first time, which reveals a novel ring&#8208;opening mode of cyclic amines.







Abstract
An unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines was successfully developed via regioselective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond cleavage of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, leading to various &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines. This reaction was achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl group and a fluorine atom scissored from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane in 100&#8201;% atom economy for the first time. The mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction underwent amine attacking 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl palladium complex to generate &#951;2&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;allyl aziridine followed by fluoride ligand transfer affording the final &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines.

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchtop NMR spectrometers are compact, lower in cost, and operate cryogen&#8208;free. The presented method using photoinduced hyperpolarization allows the detection of a protein&#8208;fragment interaction by a reduction of the ligand signal, simply by comparing the spectra measured in absence and presence of protein. Our approach enables to screen at micromolar concentrations of ligand and low micromolar concentrations of protein on a benchtop NMR.







Abstract
Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80&#8197;MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.

         <title>Charging Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes by Incorporating Crown Ethers to Capture Cations for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charging metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane realizes charge inversion from negative to positive by including crown ethers to capture cations. The result is enhanced Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The improved Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the expanding of energy&#8208;barrier deviation between Li+ and Mg2+ caused by the steric effect and the electrostatic repulsion.







Abstract
Protein channels on the biofilm conditionally manipulate ion transport via regulating the distribution of charge residues, making analogous processes on artificial membranes a hot spot and challenge. Here, we employ metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membrane with charge&#8208;adjustable subnano&#8208;channel to selectively govern ion transport. Various valent ions are binded with crown ethers embedded in the MOF cavity, which act as charged guest to regulate the channels&#8217; charge state from the negativity to positivity. Compared with the negatively charged channel, the positive counterpart obviously enhances Li+/Mg2+ selectivity, which benefit from the reinforcement of the electrostatic repulsion between ions and the channel. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations reveal that Mg2+ transport through the more positively charged channel needed to overcome higher entrance energy barrier than that of Li+. This work provides a subtle strategy for ion&#8208;selective transport upon regulating the charge state of insulating membrane, which paves the way for the application like seawater desalination and lithium extraction from salt lakes.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled J&#8208;Aggregate Nanofibers of Glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY for Synergetic Cell Membrane Disruption and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound that self&#8208;assembles in situ to form J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers acting as type&#8197;I photosensitizers. The J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers exhibited remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation efficiency, the ability to damage the tumor cell membrane, and long&#8208;term retention at tumor sites. This efficient synergistic therapeutic effect was confirmed in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;assembly of exogenous molecules is a powerful strategy for manipulating cellular behavior. However, the direct self&#8208;assembly of photochemically inert constituents into supramolecular nano&#8208;photosensitizers (PSs) within cancer cells for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound (LMBP) capable of self&#8208;assembling into J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers in situ for cell membrane destruction and type&#8197;I PDT. LMBP selectively entered human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and subsequently self&#8208;assembled into intracellular J&#8208;aggregate nanovesicles and nanofibers through supramolecular interactions. Detailed studies revealed that these J&#8208;aggregate nanostructures generated superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;) exclusively through photoinduced electron transfer, thus enabling effective PDT. Furthermore, the intracellular nanofibers exhibited an aggregation&#8208;induced retention effect, which resulted in selective toxicity to HepG2 cells by disrupting their cellular membranes and synergizing with PDT for powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo.

         <title>Bulk and Surface Contributions to Ionisation Potentials of Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of theoretical techniques, we separated the bulk and surface contributions of ionisation potentials of metal oxides, highlighting the critical role of electrostatics. Low bulk ionisation potentials and a high degree of tunability from surfaces were found in CeO2, HfO2, and ZrO2, explaining the discrepancies from measurements and guiding the future design of band&#8208;edge&#8208;related photocatalytic, photovoltaic, and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide&#8208;ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38&#8197;eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations ranging from 4.2&#8197;eV to 8.2&#8197;eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long&#8208;range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.

         <title>Photoinduced Five&#8208;Component Radical Relay Aminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical single carbonylation reactions with CO constitute a direct and robust strategy toward various carbonyl compounds from readily available chemicals, and have been extensively studied over the past decades. However, realizing highly selective catalytic systems for controlled double radical carbonylation reactions has remained a substantial challenge, particularly for the more advanced multi&#8208;component variants, despite their great potential value. Herein, we report a visible light&#8208;driven radical relayed five&#8208;component radical double aminocarbonylation reaction of unactivated alkenes using CO under metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol provides direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and high selectivity. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of amine coupling partners, sequentially acting as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor via nitrogen radical cations to form carbamoyl radicals. Cross&#8208;coupling of carbamoyl radicals with the acyl radicals that are formed in an alkene&#8208;based relay process affords double aminocarbonylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Switching of Dielectric Constant and Photoluminescence in Cyanidonitridorhenate&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials opens the applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data storage devices. Among stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, inorganic&#8208;organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order&#8208;disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitro&#8208;rhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (1) and 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (2), both crystallizing with polar N&#8208;methyl&#8208;dabconium cations. They exhibit the order&#8208;disorder phase transition related to the heating&#8208;induced turning on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to the unique synchronous switching of dielectric constant, as well as metal&#8208;complex&#8208;centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non&#8208;trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction, in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing the experimental and theoretical approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow STW&#8208;Type Zeolite Single Crystals with Aluminum Gradient for Highly&#8208;Selective Production of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol&#8211;Toluene Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with uniform micropores are important shape&#8208;selective catalysts. However, the external acid sites of zeolites have the negative impact on shape&#8208;selective catalysis, and the sole microporosity may lead to serious diffusion limitation. Herein, we report on direct synthesis of hierarchical hollow STW&#8208;type zeolite single crystals with siliceous exterior. In an alkalinous fluoride medium, the nucleation of highly siliceous STW zeolite takes place first, and the nanocrystals are preferentially aligned on the outer surface of the gel agglomerates to grow into single crystalline shells upon crystallization. The lagged crystallization of the internal Al&#8208;rich amorphous gels onto the inner surface of nanocrystalline zeolite shells lead to the formation of hollow cavities in the core of the zeolite crystals. The hollow zeolite single crystals possess low&#8208;to&#8208;high aluminum gradient from the surface to the core, resulting in an intrinsic inert external surface, and exhibit superior catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Diaryl Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers Enhance Synergistic Catalysis in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP&#8208;based photocatalysts via homo&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8208;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2&#8208;Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2&#8208;Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8208;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They&#160;increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30&#8208;fold in C&#8208;N and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer&#8208;based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

Here, we report the synthesis of two POP-based photocatalysts via homo-polymerization of vinyl-functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and co-polymerization of vinyl-functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible-light-driven C-N bond forming cross-coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2-Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2-Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C-P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides.

         <title>A DNA Logic Circuit Equipped with a Biological Amplifier Loaded into Biomimetic ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Enables Accurate Identification of Specific Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA logic circuits (DLC) enable the accurate identification of specific cell types, such as cancer cells, but they face the challenges of weak output signals and a lack of competent platforms that can efficiently deliver DLC components to the target site in the living body. To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (&#8208;30a, &#8208;17, and &#8208;21) were chosen as "AND" gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo. Thus, we envision that this strategy has great potential for clinical cancer diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells with 2D Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivating the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers is crucial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we report a dual&#8208;interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3&#8208;based PSCs by incorporating Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual&#8208;interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8208;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10 &#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5 &#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86% is realized, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20 V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92% of their initial efficiency after 1464 hours in ambient air and 80% after 1002 hours of thermal stability test at 85&#176;C.</dc:description>

While these composite materials have demonstrated promising function in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Polyanionic Electrolytes for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), the non&#8208;uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large&#8208;scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in&#8208;situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8208;COO&#8208;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA&#8208;coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114 V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA&#8208;coated Zn is 97% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate. The Zn||Cu cell assembled with the SA&#8208;coated electrode exhibits an outstanding average CE of 99.8 % over 1,400 cycles. The design is successfully demonstrated in pouch cells, where the SA&#8208;coated Zn exhibits capacity retention of 96.9% compared to 59.1% for bare Zn anode, even under the high cathode mass loading (&gt;10 mg/cm2).</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Primary Role of Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;X Hydrogen Bonding in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;X (X = N or C) hydrogen bonding is gaining increasing interest, both in the study of its intrinsic nature and in their operability in different fields. While the role of these interactions has been studied in the stabilization of gold(I) complexes, their role during the minimum free energy reaction pathway of a given catalytic process remains unexplored. We report herein that complex [Au(C&#186;CPh)(pip)] (pip = piperidine) catalyses the A3&#8208;coupling reaction for the synthesis of propargylamines, thanks to the ability of Au(I) to promote weak hydrogen bonding interactions with the reactants along the free energy profile. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that these Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;X interactions play a directing role in the catalysed A3&#8208;coupling. Topological non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), interaction region indicator (IRI) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis in real space of the electron density provides a description of these interactions accurately.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Cancer Resistance to Platinum Drugs by Inhibiting Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance is a serious challenge for platinum anticancer drugs. Platinum complexes may get over the drug resistance via a distinct mechanism of action. Cholesterol is a key factor contributing to the drug resistance. Inhibiting cellular cholesterol synthesis and uptake provides an alternative strategy for cancer treatment. Platinum(IV) complexes FP and DFP with fenofibric acid as axial ligand(s) were designed to combat the drug resistance through regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. In addition to producing reactive oxygen species and active platinum(II) species to damage DNA, FP and DFP inhibited cellular cholesterol accumulation, promoted cholesterol efflux, upregulated peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;), induced caspase&#8208;1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, thus leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis in cancer cells. The reduction of cholesterol significantly relieved the drug resistance of cancer cells. The double&#8208;acting mechanism gave the complexes strong anticancer activity in vitro and vivo, particularly against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra Robust and Highly Efficient Flexible Organic Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency Realized by Incorporating a Linker Dimerized Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wearable application of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) necessitates high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. However, photoactive films based on efficient non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) are typically brittle, leading to poor mechanical stability in devices. In this study, we achieved a remarkable PCE of 18.06% in f&#8208;OSCs while maintaining ultrahigh mechanical robustness (with a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of higher than 11%) by incorporating a linker dimerized acceptor (DOY&#8208;TVT). Compared to binary blends, ternary systems exhibit reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, suppressed crystallization and diffusion of NF&#8208;SMAs, and improved load distribution across the chain networks, enabling the dissipation of the load energy. Thus, the ternary f&#8208;OSCs developed in this study achieved, high PCE and stability, surpassing binary OSCs. Moreover, the developed f&#8208;OSCs retained 97% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles, indicating excellent mechanical stability (9.1% higher than binary systems).Furthermore, the rigid device with inverted structure based on the optimal active layer exhibited a substantial increase in efficiency retention, with 89.6% after 865 h at 85&#176;C and 93% after more than 1300 h of shelf storage at 25&#176;C. These findings highlight the potential of the linker oligomer acceptor for realizing high&#8208;performing f&#8208;OSCs with ultrahigh mechanical robustness.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Germanium(II) Halide with Strong Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the pronounced anisotropic response to circularly polarized light, chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have been regarded as promising candidates for the application in nonlinear chiroptics, especially for the second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect. However, designing novel lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides with large anisotropy factors and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT) of SHG&#8208;CD remains challenging. Herein, we develop the first chiral hybrid germanium halide, (R/S&#8208;NEA)3Ge2I7&#183;H2O (R/S&#8208;NGI), and systematically investigated its linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. S&#8208;NGI and R&#8208;NGI exhibit large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8209;CD) of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively, along with a high LDT of 3.08&#215;106 mJ/cm2; these anisotropy factors were the highest values among the reported lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides, together with a high LDT of 38.46 GW/cm2. Moreover, the effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of S&#8208;NGI could reach up to 0.86 pm/V, which was 2.9 times higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Our findings facilitate a new avenue toward lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides, and their implementation in nonlinear chiroptical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Protein Dynamics in Cells Using Chemical Cross&#8208;Linking and Hierarchical Analysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study presents a hierarchical strategy using in vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry to decode dynamic protein conformations within cells. By integrating prior structural information and utilizing diverse structure calculation algorithms, we accurately characterize dynamic conformations of multi&#8208;domain proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive protein functions within cellular environments.







Abstract
Protein dynamics play a crucial role in their diverse functions. The intracellular environment significantly influences protein dynamics, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To comprehensively capture structural information from various proteins within cells and characterize protein dynamics, chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry was employed. In this study, we introduce a hierarchical decoding strategy that enables the investigation of protein dynamics in vivo. Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross&#8208;links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full&#8208;length structure of multi&#8208;domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.

         <title>Analysis of the Dynamics of the Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Reveals Insights into the Energy Landscape of the Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total amplitude of reorientational motion extracted from MD is plotted on the GHSR molecule for apo (inactive, left) and ghrelin&#8208;bound (active, right) GHSR. Decrease in dynamics at histidine residues H2586.30 and H2806.52 upon ghrelin&#8208;binding shifts the NMR resonances to higher ppm values, whereas H186ECL2 sees smaller changes in the total motion and correspondingly has a smaller change in chemical shift.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors initiate signal transduction in response to ligand binding. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the focus of this study, binds the 28 residue peptide ghrelin. While structures of GHSR in different states of activation are available, dynamics within each state have not been investigated in depth. We analyze long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using &#8220;detectors&#8221; to compare dynamics of the apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound states yielding timescale&#8208;specific amplitudes of motion. We identify differences in dynamics between apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound GHSR in the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5&#8211;7. NMR of the GHSR histidine residues reveals chemical shift differences in these regions. We evaluate timescale specific correlation of motions between residues of ghrelin and GHSR, where binding yields a high degree of correlation for the first 8 ghrelin residues, but less correlation for the helical end. Finally, we investigate the traverse of GHSR over a rugged energy landscape via principal component analysis.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Plasticity of Kratom Pseudoindoxyl Metabolites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although opioids have been used in the treatment of pain for centuries, they cause various adverse effects and addiction. Recently, kratom alkaloids emerged as promising analgesic alternatives for pain management with considerably fewer side effects. The first scalable total synthesis of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, the most potent atypical opioid kratom metabolite, is now reported, as well as the discovery of its structural plasticity.







Abstract
Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, a kratom metabolite, has attracted increasing attention due to its favorable side effect profile as compared to conventional opioids. Herein, we describe the first enantioselective and scalable total synthesis of this natural product and its epimeric congener, speciogynine pseudoindoxyl. The characteristic spiro&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;tricyclic system of these alkaloids was formed through a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free cascade relay process in which oxidized tryptamine and secologanin analogues were used. Furthermore, we discovered that mitragynine pseudoindoxyl acts not as a single molecular entity but as a dynamic ensemble of stereoisomers in protic environments; thus, it exhibits structural plasticity in biological systems. Accordingly, these synthetic, structural, and biological studies provide a basis for the planned design of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl analogues, which can guide the development of next&#8208;generation analgesics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, a kratom metabolite, has attracted increasing attention due to its favorable side effect profile as compared to conventional opioids. Herein, we describe the first enantioselective and scalable total synthesis of this natural product and its epimeric congener, speciogynine pseudoindoxyl. The characteristic spiro-5-5-6-tricyclic system of these alkaloids was formed through a protecting-group-free cascade relay process in which oxidized tryptamine and secologanin analogues were used. Furthermore, we discovered that mitragynine pseudoindoxyl acts not as a single molecular entity but as a dynamic ensemble of stereoisomers in protic environments; thus, it exhibits structural plasticity in biological systems. Accordingly, these synthetic, structural, and biological studies provide a basis for the planned design of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl analogues, which can guide the development of next-generation analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational modelling was employed to rationally guide protein engineering toward controlling the accessible conformations of a key lactone&#8208;carbene (LAC) intermediate in the enzyme active site by installing a new H&#8208;bond anchoring point. This H&#8208;bonding interaction controls the relative orientation of the fleeting carbene intermediate, orienting it for an enantioselective N&#8208;nucleophilic attack by the amine substrate.







Abstract
We report a computationally driven approach to access enantiodivergent enzymatic carbene N&#8722;H insertions catalyzed by P411 enzymes. Computational modeling was employed to rationally guide engineering efforts to control the accessible conformations of a key lactone&#8208;carbene (LAC) intermediate in the enzyme active site by installing a new H&#8208;bond anchoring point. This H&#8208;bonding interaction controls the relative orientation of the reactive carbene intermediate, orienting it for an enantioselective N&#8208;nucleophilic attack by the amine substrate. By combining MD simulations and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screening targeted to only two key residues, we were able to reverse the stereoselectivity of previously engineered S&#8208;selective P411 enzymes. The resulting variant, L5_FL&#8208;B3, accepts a broad scope of amine substrates for N&#8722;H insertion with excellent yields (up to &gt;99&#8201;%), high efficiency (up to 12&#8201;300 TTN), and good enantiocontrol (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93 er).

         <title>Integrated Soft Porosity and Electrical Properties of Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;Insulating Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>

Owing to the integration of soft porosity and electrical properties, conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals (with the semiconductive soft porous interfaces) show enhanced selective sorption toward CO2, electrical gating, and &#8220;shape memory&#8221; effects for the guest responsive iMOF core, as revealed by operando synchrotron measurements.







Abstract
A one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;bird method to integrate the soft porosity and electrical properties of distinct metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into a single material involves the design of conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating MOF (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructures that allow for direct electrical control. Herein, we report the synthesis of cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures using a seeded layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method, in which the sorptive iMOF core is combined with chemiresistive cMOF shells. The resulting cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures exhibit enhanced selective sorption of CO2 compared to the pristine iMOF (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar, S
 from 15.4 of ZIF&#8208;7 to 43.2&#8211;152.8). This enhancement is attributed to the porous interface formed by the hybridization of both frameworks at the molecular level. Furthermore, owing to the flexible structure of the iMOF core, the cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures with semiconductive soft porous interfaces demonstrated high flexibility in sensing and electrical &#8220;shape memory&#8221; toward acetone and CO2. This behavior was observed through the guest&#8208;induced structural changes of the iMOF core, as revealed by the operando synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces with Modified Intermediate Configurations Realizing Nearly 100% CO2 Electrocatalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO is achieved by Ag nanodomains loaded on ZnO porous nanobelts coupled with high electronic conductivity MXene (Ag&#8722;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx). The unique Ti3C2Tx&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces can modulate the formation and configuration of *CO intermediates (eg. linear&#8208; or bridge&#8208;bonded CO), which is suitable for highly selective and efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via renewable electricity provides a sustainable way to produce valued chemicals, while it suffers from low activity and selectivity. Herein, we constructed a novel catalyst with unique Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces, undercoordinated surface sites, as well as mesoporous nanostructures. The designed Ag&#8722;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx catalyst achieves an outstanding CO2 conversion performance of a nearly 100% CO Faraday efficiency with high partial current density of 22.59&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The electronic donation of Ag and up&#8208;shifted d&#8208;band center relative to Fermi level within MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces contributes the high selectivity of CO. The CO2 conversion is highly correlated with the dominated linear&#8208;bonded CO intermediate confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This work enlightens the rational design of unique metal&#8208;oxide interfaces with the regulation of MXene for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction.

         <title>Rotaxane Formation of Multicyclic Polydimethylsiloxane in a Silicone Network: A Step toward Constructing &#8220;Macro&#8208;Rotaxanes&#8221; from High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Axle and Wheel Components</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Macro&#8208;rotaxanes&#8221; which consist of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components were constructed by in situ cross&#8208;linking of linear polymers in the presence of multicyclic polymers. Extending the concept of topological trapping to multicyclic showed that multicyclic polymers with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped, with up to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% successfully topologically trapped as macro&#8208;rotaxanes.







Abstract
Rotaxanes consisting of a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components (macro&#8208;rotaxanes) have high structural freedom, and are attractive for soft&#8208;material applications. However, their synthesis remains underexplored. Here, we investigated macro&#8208;rotaxane formation by the topological trapping of multicyclic polydimethylsiloxanes (mc&#8208;PDMSs) in silicone networks. mc&#8208;PDMS with different numbers of cyclic units and ring sizes was synthesized by cyclopolymerization of a &#945;,&#969;&#8208;norbornenyl&#8208;functionalized PDMS. Silicone networks were prepared in the presence of 10&#8211;60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS, and the trapping efficiency of mc&#8208;PDMS was determined. In contrast to monocyclic PDMS, mc&#8208;PDMSs with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped in the network as macro&#8208;rotaxanes. The damping performance of a 60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS&#8208;blended silicone network was evaluated, revealing a higher tan &#948; value than the bare PDMS network. Thus, macro&#8208;rotaxanes are promising as non&#8208;leaching additives for network polymers.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Macro-rotaxanes&#8221; which consist of high-molecular-weight axle and wheel components were constructed by in situ cross-linking of linear polymers in the presence of multicyclic polymers. Extending the concept of topological trapping to multicyclic showed that multicyclic polymers with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped, with up to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% successfully topologically trapped as macro-rotaxanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotaxanes consisting of a high-molecular-weight axle and wheel components (macro-rotaxanes) have high structural freedom, and are attractive for soft-material applications. However, their synthesis remains underexplored. Here, we investigated macro-rotaxane formation by the topological trapping of multicyclic polydimethylsiloxanes (&lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMSs) in silicone networks. &lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMS with different numbers of cyclic units and ring sizes was synthesized by cyclopolymerization of a &lt;i&gt;&#945;,&#969;-&lt;/i&gt;norbornenyl-functionalized PDMS. Silicone networks were prepared in the presence of 10&#8211;60&#8197;wt&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMS, and the trapping efficiency of &lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMS was determined. In contrast to monocyclic PDMS, &lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMSs with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped in the network as macro-rotaxanes. The damping performance of a 60&#8197;wt&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;mc-&lt;/i&gt;PDMS-blended silicone network was evaluated, revealing a higher tan &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; value than the bare PDMS network. Thus, macro-rotaxanes are promising as non-leaching additives for network polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled NiII&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylarylation of Alkenes with Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylarylation of alkenes has been realized with highly efficient and excellent regioselectivity employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and hydroxyl source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#947;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols, &#947;&#8208;aminoalcohols, and 1,3&#8208;diols in high yields.







Abstract
The use of molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in transition metal catalyzed oxidative process is an appealing and challenging task in organic synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylarylation of unactivated alkenes enabled by a &#946;&#8208;diketone ligand with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and hydroxyl source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#947;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols, &#947;&#8208;aminoalcohols, and 1,3&#8208;diols in high yields. The synthetic value of this methodology was demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of two bioactive compounds, (&#177;)&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyl citreochlorol and tea catechin metabolites M4.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Substrate&#8211;Catalyst Halogen&#8211;Halogen Interactions for Boosting Enantioselectivity in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards boosted enantioselectivities in primary halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is presented. Fine&#8208;tuned multiple halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and halogen&#8208;bond (XB)&#8208;donor catalyst, through both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the incorporated halogen substituents, allows enantioselectivities of up to 90&#8201;% ee in model anion&#8208;binding&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reactions.







Abstract
A new approach towards highly enantioselective halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis has been developed. To circumvent the intrinsic issues of the nature of the halogen&#8208;bond (XB) and the resultant unresolved limitations in asymmetric catalysis, fine&#8208;tuned halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and XB&#8208;donor were designed to preorganize the substrate in the catalyst's cavity and boost enantiocontrol. The present strategy exploits both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the halogen substituent of the substrates to form a tight catalyst&#8211;substrate&#8211;counteranion chiral complex, thus enabling a controlled induction of high levels of chirality transfer. Remarkable enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 e.r. (90&#8201;% ee) have been achieved in a model dearomatization reaction of halogen&#8208;substituted (iso)quinolines with tetrakis&#8208;iodotriazole multidentate anion&#8208;binding catalysts.

         <dc:description>
We report on a study of copper&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of internal allylic carbonates using functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit good regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products, enabling the preparation of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.







Abstract
We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, regioselective, and stereospecific alkylation of unbiased internal allylic carbonates with functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit high stereospecificity and regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products under two sets of copper&#8208;catalyzed conditions, which enables the preparation of a broad range of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Polarization Schemes for Improved Heteronuclear Transfers Involving Labile Protons in Biomolecular Solution NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;polarization approaches to enhance 1H&#8594;15N magnetization transfer processes involving labile protons are explored, which are capable of covering the large frequency ranges required to tackle such systems. Strategies based on both phase and frequency&#8208;modulated 1H waveforms are proposed, and their superior performance experimentally verified.







Abstract
INEPT&#8208;based experiments are widely used for 1H&#8594;15N transfers, but often fail when involving labile protons due to solvent exchanges. J&#8208;based cross polarization (CP) strategies offer a more efficient alternative to perform such transfers, particularly when leveraging the Hwater
HN exchange process to boost the 1H&#8594;15N transfer process. This leveraging, however, demands the simultaneous spin&#8208;locking of both Hwater and HN protons by a strong 1H RF field, while fulfilling the &#947;HB1,H=&#947;NB1,N Hartmann&#8208;Hahn matching condition. Given the low value of &#947;N/&#947;H, however, these demands are often incompatible&#8212;particularly when experiments are executed by the power&#8208;limited cryogenic probes used in contemporary high field NMR. The present manuscript discusses CP alternatives that can alleviate this limitation, and evaluates their performance on urea, amino acids, and intrinsically disordered proteins. These alternatives include new CP variants based on frequency&#8208;swept and phase&#8208;modulated pulses, designed to simultaneously fulfill the aforementioned conflicting conditions. Their performances vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis current options are theoretically analyzed with Liouville&#8208;space simulations, and experimentally tested with double and triple resonance transfer experiments.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Non&#8208;radiative Recombination Energy Losses in Organic Solar Cells Based on Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric acceptors, BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl, were developed to study the relationship between the energy loss mechanism and molecular structure. The results demonstrate that the decreased surface electrostatic potential difference between asymmetric acceptor and donor reduces the charge transfer state ratio, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss.







Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) is one key to boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells. Although the recent studies have indicated that the Y&#8208;series asymmetric acceptors&#8208;based devices featured relatively low &#916;E3, the understanding of the energy loss mechanism derived from molecular structure change is still lagging behind. Herein, two asymmetric acceptors named BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl with different terminals were synthesized to make a clear comparative study with the symmetric acceptor BTP&#8208;0Cl. Our results suggest that asymmetric acceptors exhibit a larger difference of electrostatic potential (ESP) in terminals and semi&#8208;molecular dipole moment, which contributes to form a stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Besides, the experimental and theoretical studies reveal that a lower ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular interaction can reduce the distribution of PM6 near the interface to enhance the built&#8208;in potential and decrease the charge transfer state ratio for asymmetric acceptors. Therefore, the devices achieve a higher exciton dissociation efficiency and lower &#916;E3. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and provides a new perspective to understand the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric acceptors.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time pH&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of Ionisable Lipids from COVID&#8208;19 Vaccines and In Situ Nucleic Acid Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The millisecond kinetic evolution of the ordered structure formation upon the complexation of ionisable lipid (SM&#8208;102), a novel structural&#8208;forming helper lipid (monoolein, MO) and nucleic acids (e.g., mRNA) are quantitatively investigated using in situ time&#8208;resolved small angle X&#8208;ray scattering coupled with rapid flow mixing, which will help deciphering the optimal ionisable lipid nanoparticle nanostructures for efficient gene delivery.







Abstract
Ionisable amino&#8208;lipid is a key component in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which plays a crucial role in the encapsulation of RNA molecules, allowing efficient cellular uptake and then releasing RNA from acidic endosomes. Herein, we present direct evidence for the remarkable structural transitions, with decreasing membrane curvature, including from inverse micellar, to inverse hexagonal, to two distinct inverse bicontinuous cubic, and finally to a lamellar phase for the two mainstream COVID&#8208;19 vaccine ionisable ALC&#8208;0315 and SM&#8208;102 lipids, occurring upon gradual acidification as encountered in endosomes. The millisecond kinetic growth of the inverse cubic and hexagonal structures and the evolution of the ordered structural formation upon ionisable lipid&#8208;RNA/DNA complexation are quantitatively revealed by in situ synchrotron radiation time&#8208;resolved small angle X&#8208;ray scattering coupled with rapid flow mixing. We found that the final self&#8208;assembled structural identity, and the formation kinetics, were controlled by the ionisable lipid molecular structure, acidic bulk environment, lipid compositions, and nucleic acid molecular structure/size. The implicated link between the inverse membrane curvature of LNP and LNP endosomal escape helps future optimisation of ionisable lipids and LNP engineering for RNA and gene delivery.

         <title>A Supported Catalyst that Enables the Synthesis of Colorless CO2&#8208;Polyols with Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing a supported catalyst featuring immobilization&#8208;enhanced proton tolerance for the synthesis of colorless ULMW CO2&#8208;polyols is proposed. The key design feature lies in the loading of aluminum aminoporphyrins on swellable Merrifield resin to afford the multiple cooperativity of porphyrins in the supported catalysts.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight (ULMW) CO2&#8208;polyols with well&#8208;defined hydroxyl end groups represent useful soft segments for the preparation of high&#8208;performance polyurethane foams. However, owing to the poor proton tolerance of catalysts towards CO2/epoxide telomerization, it remains challenging to synthesize ULMW yet colorless CO2&#8208;polyols. Herein, we propose an immobilization strategy of constructing supported catalysts by chemical anchoring of aluminum porphyrin on Merrifield resin. The resulting supported catalyst displays both extremely high proton tolerance (&#8776;8000&#8197;times the equivalents of metal centers) and independence of cocatalyst, affording CO2&#8208;polyols with ULMW (580&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and high polymer selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Moreover, the ULMW CO2&#8208;polyols with various architectures (tri&#8208;, quadra&#8208;, and hexa&#8208;arm) can be obtained, suggesting the wide proton universality of supported catalysts. Notably, benefiting from the heterogeneous nature of the supported catalyst, colorless products can be facilely achieved by simple filtration. The present strategy provides a platform for the synthesis of colorless ULMW polyols derived from not only CO2/epoxides, but also lactone, anhydrides etc. or their combinations.

         <title>A Quadruple&#8208;Borylated Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitter with para/meta Heteroatomic Patterns for Narrowband Orange&#8208;Red Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid pattern strategy is proposed, and a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept multiple resonance emitter containing four boron atoms and six nitrogen atoms, namely, B4N6&#8208;Me, is designed. B4N6&#8208;Me realizes narrowband orange&#8208;red emission with an extremely narrow full width at half maximum of 19&#8197;nm (energy unit: 70&#8197;meV) and delivers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 35.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hindered by spectral broadening issues with redshifted emission, long&#8208;wavelength (e.g., maxima beyond 570&#8197;nm) multiple resonance (MR) emitters with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) below 20&#8197;nm remain absent. Herein, by strategically embedding diverse boron (B)/nitrogen (N) atomic pairs into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeleton, we propose a hybrid pattern for the construction of a long&#8208;wavelength narrowband MR emitter. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter B4N6&#8208;Me realized orange&#8208;red emission with an extremely small FWHM of 19&#8197;nm (energy unit: 70&#8197;meV), representing the narrowest FWHM among all reported long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cooperation of the applied para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N and para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B/N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N patterns is complementary, which gives rise to both narrowband and redshift characteristics. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing B4N6&#8208;Me achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, e.g., a narrowband orange&#8208;red emission with an FWHM of 27&#8197;nm (energy unit: 99&#8197;meV), an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8&#8201;%, and ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE of 28.4&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). This work provides new insights into the further molecular design and synthesis of long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrin Organic Cages for Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Water

We present a supramolecular strategy for electrochemical nitrate reduction by augmenting porosity and electrochemically active sites as well as facilitating catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions. The resulting 3D architecture enables selective ammonia production in water with greater than 90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and turnover numbers exceeding 200,000, representing a 15&#8208;fold increase in activity and higher catalytic stability over its 2D counterpart.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable approach for denitrification to balance global nitrogen cycles and an alternative to traditional thermal Haber&#8208;Bosch processes. Here, we present a supramolecular strategy for promoting NH3 production in water from NO3RR by integrating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP) units into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous organic cage architecture. The porphyrin box CoPB&#8208;C8 enhances electrochemical active site exposure, facilitates substrate&#8211;catalyst interactions, and improves catalyst stability, leading to turnover numbers and frequencies for NH3 production exceeding 200,000 and 56&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. These values represent a 15&#8208;fold increase in NO3RR activity and 200&#8208;mV improvement in overpotential for the 3D CoPB&#8208;C8 box structure compared to its 2D CoTPP counterpart. Synthetic tuning of peripheral alkyl substituents highlights the importance of supramolecular porosity and cavity size on electrochemical NO3RR activity. These findings establish the incorporation of 2D molecular units into 3D confined space microenvironments as an effective supramolecular design strategy for enhancing electrocatalysis.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Solution Synthesis of Graphene Nanoribbons with Precisely Engineered Nanopores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous graphene nanoribbon (pGNR) has been obtained for the first time by bottom&#8208;up solution&#8208;phase synthesis. The key design is to use the tailor&#8208;made polyphenylene precursor bearing pre&#8208;installed hexagonal nanopores, which allows us to access the pGNR with fully conjugated backbone and precisely embedded nanopores. The resultant pGNR presents enlarged band gap and enhanced liquid&#8208;phase processability, compared to its nonporous counterparts.







Abstract
The incorporation of nanopores into graphene nanostructures has been demonstrated as an efficient tool in tuning their band gaps and electronic structures. However, precisely embedding the uniform nanopores into graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at the atomic level remains underdeveloped especially for in&#8208;solution synthesis due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Herein we report the first case of solution&#8208;synthesized porous GNR (pGNR) with a fully conjugated backbone via the efficient Scholl reaction of tailor&#8208;made polyphenylene precursor (P1) bearing pre&#8208;installed hexagonal nanopores. The resultant pGNR features periodic subnanometer pores with a uniform diameter of 0.6&#8197;nm and an adjacent&#8208;pores&#8208;distance of 1.7&#8197;nm. To solidify our design strategy, two porous model compounds (1&#8201;a, 1&#8201;b) containing the same pore size as the shortcuts of pGNR, are successfully synthesized. The chemical structure and photophysical properties of pGNR are investigated by various spectroscopic analyses. Notably, the embedded periodic nanopores largely reduce the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and alleviate the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, compared to the nonporous GNRs with similar widths, affording pGNR with a notably enlarged band gap and enhanced liquid&#8208;phase processability.

         <title>A Membrane Tension&#8208;Responsive Mechanosensitive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic DNA nanomachine inspired by the natural PIEZO channel. This nanomachine incorporates multifunctional molecular components onto DNA frameworks, allowing for the in situ measurement of membrane tension and membrane curvatures in real time, which opens up new avenues for studying cellular membrane dynamics.







Abstract
Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six&#8208;helix&#8208;bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol&#8208;based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young&#8208;Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.

         <title>A Thiophene Backbone Enables Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(arylene vinylene)s with High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline, planar and fully thiophene&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional poly(arylene vinylene) is developed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation. It exhibits a narrow optical band gap and efficient &#960;&#8208;delocalization for band&#8208;like transport and high charge carrier mobility.







Abstract
Linear conjugated polymers have attracted significant attention in organic electronics in recent decades. However, despite intrachain &#960;&#8208;delocalization, interchain hopping is their transport bottleneck. In contrast, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers, as represented by 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs), can provide multiple conjugated strands to enhance the delocalization of charge carriers in space. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of thiophene&#8208;based 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT and 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, BDT=benzodithiophene, BT=bithiophene, BP=biphenyl) via Knoevenagel polycondensation. Compared with 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, the fully thiophene&#8208;based 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT exhibits enhanced planarity and &#960;&#8208;delocalization with a small band gap (1.62&#8197;eV) and large electronic band dispersion, as revealed by the optical absorption and density functional calculations. Remarkably, temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz spectroscopy discloses a unique band&#8208;like transport and outstanding room&#8208;temperature charge mobility for 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT (65&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which far exceeds that of the linear PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, and the reported 2D c&#8208;COFs in the powder form. This work highlights the great potential of thiophene&#8208;based 2D PAVs as candidates for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronics.

         <title>Locating Hydrogen Positions for COF&#8208;300 by Cryo&#8208;3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>

The hydrogen atoms of a covalent organic framework on the framework and guest molecules were located using cryo&#8208;3D electron diffraction for the first time. The host&#8211;guest interactions in the framework material were clarified by locating the hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have wide&#8208;ranging applications, and their host&#8211;guest interactions play an essential role in the achievement of COF functions. To investigate these host&#8211;guest interactions, it is necessary to locate all atoms, especially hydrogen atoms. However, it is difficult to determine the hydrogen atomic positions in COFs because of the complexities in synthesizing high&#8208;quality large single crystals. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has unique advantages for the structural determination of nanocrystals and identification of light atoms. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogen atoms of a COF, not only on the framework but also on the guest molecule, can be located by 3D ED using continuous precession electron diffraction tomography (cPEDT) under cryogenic conditions. The host&#8211;guest interactions were clarified with the location of the hydrogen atoms. These findings provide novel insights into the investigation of COFs.

         <title>Towards a Precise NMR Quantification of Acute Phase Inflammation Proteins from Human Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum show two characteristic signals originating from acute phase glycoprotein glycans, termed GlycA and B. We have unambiguously assigned them to Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. They can be used for the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins in 10&#8211;20&#8197;min. The method is illustrated with serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 patients.







Abstract
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum and plasma show, besides metabolites and lipoproteins, two characteristic signals termed GlycA and B arising from the acetyl groups of glycoprotein glycans from acute phase proteins, which constitute good markers for inflammatory processes. Here, we report a comprehensive assignment of glycoprotein glycan NMR signals observed in human serum, showing that GlycA and GlycB signals originate from Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. Diffusion&#8208;edited NMR experiments demonstrate that signal components can be associated with specific acute phase proteins. Conventionally determined concentrations of acute phase glycoproteins correlate well with distinct features in NMR spectra (R2 up to 0.9422, p&#8208;value &lt;0.001), allowing the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins. Overall, a proteo&#8208;metabolomics NMR signature of significant diagnostic potential is obtained within 10&#8211;20&#8197;min acquisition time. This is exemplified in serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 and cardiogenic shock patients showing significant changes in several acute phase proteins compared to healthy controls.

         <title>Reversible Electrodeposition of Potassium&#8208;bridged Molecular Vanadium Oxides: A New Approach Towards Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled redox&#8208;driven and K+ cation&#8208;assisted reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters is reported as a new approach for multi&#8208;electron storage.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides, so&#8208;called polyoxometalates (POMs), have shown outstanding performance as catalysts and lately attracted interest as materials in energy conversion and storage systems due to their capability of storing and exchanging multiple electrons. Here, we report the first example of redox&#8208;driven reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters, leading to the formation of thin films. The detailed investigation of the deposition mechanism reveals that the reversibility is dependent on the reduction potential. Correlating electrochemical quartz microbalance studies with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data gave insight into the redox chemistry and oxidation states of vanadium in the deposited films in dependence on the potential window. A multi&#8208;electron reduction of the polyoxovanadate cluster, which facilitates the potassium (K+) cation&#8208;assisted reversible formation of potassium vanadium oxide thin films was confirmed. At anodic potentials, re&#8208;oxidation of the polyoxovanadate and complete stripping of the thin film is observed for films deposited at potentials more positive than &#8722;500&#8197;mV vs. Ag/Ag+, while electrodeposition at more negative cathodic potential reduces the electrochemical reversibility of the process and increases the stripping overpotential. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the deposited films for potential use in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Fluorogenic DNAzyme for A Thermally Stable Protein Biomarker from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Human Bacterial Pathogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusobacterium nucleatum is a pathogenic bacterium associated with many poor human health conditions, such as gum disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and colorectal cancer. An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, RFD&#8208;FN1, was isolated through in vitro selection to selectively recognize a heat stable biomarker of this bacterium, establishing the opportunity to develop diagnostic platforms for this pathogen.







Abstract
Fusobacterium nucleatum has been correlated to many poor human conditions including oral infections, adverse pregnancies and cancer, and thus molecular tools capable of detecting this human pathogen can be used to develop diagnostic tests for them. Using a new selection method targeting thermally stable proteins without a counter&#8208;selection step, we derived an fluorogenic RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RFD&#8208;FN1, that can be activated by a thermally stable protein target that is unique to F. nucleatum subspecies. High thermal stability of protein targets is a very desirable attribute for DNAzyme&#8208;based biosensing directly with biological samples because nucleases found inherently in these samples can be heat&#8208;inactivated. We further demonstrate that RFD&#8208;FN1 can function as a fluorescent sensor in both human saliva and human stool samples. The discovery of RFD&#8208;FN1 paired with a highly thermal stable protein target presents opportunities for developing simpler diagnostic tests for this important pathogen.

         <title>Modular&#8208;Approach Synthesis of Giant Molecule Acceptors via Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Knoevenagel Condensation for Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective approach to accessing giant molecule acceptors is presented, employing a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation (or its silyl&#8208;mediated version). Notably, this new approach significantly expands the range of substrates that enables the use of readily available diboronated linkers. This methodology also offers a modular and robust synthesis of tailor&#8208;made donor&#8208;acceptors for a wide range of emerging technologies.







Abstract
The operational stability of polymer solar cells is a critical concern with respect to the thermodynamic relaxation of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) or A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A structured small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) within their blends with polymer donors. Giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) bearing SMAs as subunits offer a solution to this issue, while their classical synthesis via the Stille coupling suffers from low reaction efficiency and difficulty in obtaining mono&#8208;brominated SMA, rendering the approach impractical for their large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost preparation. In this study, we present a simple and cost&#8208;effective solution to this challenge through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with boron trifluoride etherate (BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2) as catalyst. We demonstrated that the coupling of the monoaldehyde&#8208;terminated A&#8208;D&#8208;CHO unit and the methylene&#8208;based A&#8208;link&#8208;A (or its silyl enol ether counterpart) substrates can be quantitatively achieved within 30&#8197;minutes in the presence of acetic anhydride, affording a variety of GMAs connected via the flexible and conjugated linkers. The photophysical properties was fully studied, yielding a high device efficiency of over 18&#8201;%. Our findings offer a promising alternative for the modular synthesis of GMAs with high yields, easier work up, and the widespread application of such methodology will undoubtedly accelerate the progress of stable polymer solar cells.

In this study, we present a simple and cost-effective solution to this challenge through Lewis acid-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with boron trifluoride etherate (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as catalyst. We demonstrated that the coupling of the monoaldehyde-terminated A-D-CHO unit and the methylene-based A-link-A (or its silyl enol ether counterpart) substrates can be quantitatively achieved within 30&#8197;minutes in the presence of acetic anhydride, affording a variety of GMAs connected via the flexible and conjugated linkers. The photophysical properties was fully studied, yielding a high device efficiency of over 18&#8201;%. Our findings offer a promising alternative for the modular synthesis of GMAs with high yields, easier work up, and the widespread application of such methodology will undoubtedly accelerate the progress of stable polymer solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;Based Separator with Interfacial Chemistry Regulation for Robust Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
K plating/stripping in potassium metal battery is regulated via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework (MOF). These functional units in the separator offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are ideal choices for high energy density storage system owing to the low electrochemical potential and low cost of K. However, the practical KMB applications suffer from intrinsically active K anode, which would bring serious safety concerns due to easier generation of dendrites. Herein, to explore a facile approach to tackle this issue, we propose to regulate K plating/stripping via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework. As a case study, the functional units of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Benefiting from these favorable features, uniform and stable K plating/stripping is realized with the regulated separator. Full battery assembled with the regulated separator showed &#8764;19.9&#8201;% higher discharge capacity than that with glass fiber separator at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and much better cycling stability at high rates. The generality of our approach is validated with KMBs using different cathodes and electrolytes. We envision that the strategy to suppress dendrite formation by commercial separator surface engineering using tailor&#8208;designed functional units can be extended to other metal/metal ion batteries.

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Highly Symmetrical Terbium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Exhibiting Luminescent Self&#8208;Monitoring of Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical thermometer was obtained by the dehydration of a cyanido&#8208;bridged TbIII&#8722;CoIII framework. By this transformation, the TbIII centers change geometry to high&#8208;symmetry trigonal prismatic. This also induces a strong magnetic anisotropy providing single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behavior with an energy barrier of 594(18)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and a wide temperature overlap with optical thermometry.







Abstract
A conjunction of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behavior and luminescence thermometry is an emerging research line aiming at contactless read&#8208;out of temperature in future SMM&#8208;based devices. The shared working range between slow magnetic relaxation and the thermometric response is typically narrow or absent. We report TbIII&#8208;based emissive SMMs formed in a cyanido&#8208;bridged framework whose properties are governed by the reversible structural transformation from [TbIII(H2O)2][CoIII(CN)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O (1) to its dehydrated phase, TbIII[CoIII(CN)6] (2). The 8&#8208;coordinated complexes in 1 show the moderate SMM effect but it is enhanced for trigonal&#8208;prismatic TbIII complexes in 2, showing the SMM features up to 42&#8197;K. They are governed by the combination of QTM, Raman, and Orbach relaxation with the energy barrier of 594(18)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (854(26) K), one of the highest among the TbIII&#8208;based molecular nanomagnets. Both systems exhibit emission related to the f&#8211;f electronic transitions, with the temperature variations resulting in the optical thermometry below 100&#8197;K. The dehydration leads to a wide temperature overlap between the SMM behavior and thermometry, from 6&#8197;K to 42&#8197;K. These functionalities are further enriched after the magnetic dilution. The role of post&#8208;synthetic formation of high&#8208;symmetry TbIII complexes in achieving the SMM effect and hot&#8208;bands&#8208;based optical thermometry is discussed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Hydrogenation of C=O Bonds of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Pentanones</title>

         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal copper catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pentanones affording the corresponding chiral exocyclic allylic pentanols in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) is reported. Mechanistic studies indicate that only the C=O bond is chemoselectively reduced and the reaction is promoted via the multiple attractive dispersion interactions between the Cu catalyst and substrate.







Abstract
A highly chemoselective earth&#8208;abundant transition metal copper catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O bonds of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pentanones was realized using H2. The desired products were obtained with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99&#8201;% ee, after recrystallization). The corresponding chiral exocyclic allylic pentanol products can be converted into several bioactive molecules. The hydrogenation mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and control experiments, which indicate that the keto&#8208;enol isomerization rate of the substrate is faster than that of the hydrogenation and also show that the Cu&#8722;H complex can only catalyze chemoselectively the asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group. Computational results indicate that the multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI effect) between the catalyst with bulky substituents and substrate play important roles which stabilize the transition states and reduce the generation of by&#8208;products.

         <title>A Photosensitizing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Tandem Reaction Catalyst for Primary Alcohols from Terminal Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;CTU&#8208;based photosensitizing covalent metal&#8211;organic framework (JNM&#8208;20) was constructed. The MOF possessed broadband light absorption, excellent photoinduced charge&#8208;separation efficiency, and photochemical properties, allowing the production of primary alcohols from terminal alkenes and alkynes with excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity, good overall yields, broad substrate compatibility, and good reusability via tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Owing to the wide and growing demand for primary alcohols, the development of efficient catalysts with high regioselectivity remains a worthwhile pursuit. However, according to Markovnikov's rule, it is a challenge to obtain primary alcohols with high yields and regioselectivity from terminal alkenes or alkynes. Herein, we report the synthesis of a photosensitizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) from cyclic trinuclear copper(I) units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) and a boron dipyrro&#8208;methene (Bodipy) ligand. The MOF features broadband light absorption, excellent photoinduced charge separation efficiency, and photochemical properties. By integrating the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration and photocatalyzed aerobic oxidation, it can catalyze terminal alkenes and alkynes to produce primary alcohols via a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction with excellent regioselectivity, good overall yields in two&#8208;step reactions (up to 85&#8201;%), broad substrate compatibility (32&#8197;examples) and good reusability under mild conditions.

By integrating the copper-catalyzed hydroboration and photocatalyzed aerobic oxidation, it can catalyze terminal alkenes and alkynes to produce primary alcohols via a one-pot tandem reaction with excellent regioselectivity, good overall yields in two-step reactions (up to 85&#8201;%), broad substrate compatibility (32&#8197;examples) and good reusability under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Luminescent Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Tunable Color for Nanomolar Detection of Iron(III), Ofloxacin and Gossypol and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly emissive terbium(III) MOF exhibits excellent sensing properties with exceptionally low detection limits towards iron(III), ofloxacin and gossypol in water. A novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting QR&#8208;coding Scheme based on unique and tunable emission spectra of Ln&#8208;MOFs was designed.







Abstract
Solvothermal reaction of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylbis(oxy))diisophthalic acid (H4L) with europium(III) or terbium(III) nitrates in acetonitrile&#8208;water (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave rise to isostructural 2D coordination polymers, [Ln(HL)(H2O)3]&#8734; (NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Eu and NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Tb), the layers of which are composed by eight&#8208;coordinated lanthanide(III) ions interconnected by triply deprotonated ligands HL3&#8722;. The layers are packed in the crystal without any specific intermolecular interactions between them, allowing the facile preparation of stable water suspensions, in which NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Tb exhibited top&#8208;performing sensing properties through luminescence quenching effect with exceptionally low detection limits towards Fe3+ (LOD 8.62&#8197;nM), ofloxacin (OFX) antibiotic (LOD 3.91&#8197;nM) and cotton phytotoxicant gossypol (LOD 2.27&#8197;nM). In addition to low detection limit and high selectivity, NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Tb features fast sensing response (within 60&#8211;90&#8197;seconds), making it superior to other MOF&#8208;based sensors for metal cations and organic toxicants. The photoluminescence quantum yield of NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Tb was 93&#8201;%, one of the highest among lanthanide MOFs. Mixed&#8208;metal coordination polymers NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;EuxTb1&#8722;x demonstrated efficient photoluminescence, the color of which could be modulated by the excitation wavelength and time delay for emission monitoring (within 1 millisecond). Furthermore, an original 2D QR&#8208;coding scheme was designed for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labeling of goods based on unique and tunable emission spectra of NIIC&#8208;1&#8208;Ln coordination polymers.

         <title>Pentafluorocyclopropanation of (Hetero)arenes Using Sulfonium Salts: Applications in Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented sulfonium salt is presented, which under mild photochemical conditions, is able to transfer pentafluorocyclo&#8208;propenyl groups (C3F5&#8722;) at unfunctionalized positions of a number of (hetero)arenes. The reaction is compatible with a variety of functional groups, rendering this method a practical tool for future drug optimization campaigns.







Abstract
The evaluation of the pentafluorocyclopropyl group as a chemotype in crop protection and medicinal chemistry has been hampered in the past by the lack of suitable methodologies that enable the practical incorporation of this moiety into advanced synthetic intermediates. Herein, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(pentafluorocyclopropyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the photoinduced C&#8722;H pentafluorocyclopropylation of a broad series of non&#8208;previously functionalized (hetero)arenes through a radical mediated mechanism. The scope and potential benefits of the protocol developed are further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage introduction of the pentafluorocyclopropyl unit into biologically relevant molecules and widely used pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Extension of Non&#8208;alternant Nanographenes Containing Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saddle&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales topological defects have been synthesized that possess much narrower energy gaps than similar&#8208;sized N&#8208;doped nanographenes with six&#8208;membered rings. This work indicates that the introduction of non&#8208;alternant topologies is an efficient way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular size.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant topologies have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics in recent years. Here, three novel topological nanographenes molecular models of nitrogen&#8208;doped Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales (S&#8211;T&#8211;W) defects were achieved through intramolecular direct arylation. Their chemical structures were unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal analysis. Among them, threefold intramolecular direct arylation compound (C42H21N) is the largest nanographene bearing a N&#8208;doped non&#8208;alternant topology to date, in which the non&#8208;benzenoid rings account for 83&#8201;% of the total molecular skeleton. The absorption maxima of this compound was located in the near&#8208;infrared region with a long tail up to 900&#8197;nm, which was much longer than those reported for similarly sized N&#8208;doped nanographene with six&#8208;membered rings (C40H15N). In addition, the electronic energy gaps of these series compounds clearly decreased with the introduction of non&#8208;alternant topologies (from 2.27&#8197;eV to 1.50&#8197;eV). It is noteworthy that C42H21N possesses such a low energy gap (Egopt=1.40&#8197;eV; Egcv=1.50&#8197;eV), yet is highly stable under ambient conditions. Our work reported herein demonstrates that the non&#8208;alternant topology could significantly influence the electronic configurations of nanocarbons, where the introduction of a non&#8208;alternanting topology may be an effective way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>Generation and Stabilization of a Dinickel Catalyst in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a robust, efficient, and reusable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst is described. Adaptive generation and stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible dinickel active sites, (bpy.&#8722;)NiII(&#956;2&#8208;H)2NiII(bpy.&#8722;) (bipyridine (bpy)), on MOF&#8208;253 yield a catalyst that efficiently semihydrogenates alkynes to afford (Z)&#8208;stilbenes and selectively hydrogenates C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and ketones.







Abstract
Although many monometallic active sites have been installed in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalytic reactions, there are no effective strategies to generate bimetallic catalysts in MOFs. Here we report the synthesis of a robust, efficient, and reusable MOF catalyst, MOF&#8208;NiH, by adaptively generating and stabilizing dinickel active sites using the bipyridine groups in MOF&#8208;253 with the formula of Al(OH)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) for Z&#8208;selective semihydrogenation of alkynes and selective hydrogenation of C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Spectroscopic studies established the dinickel complex (bpy&#8901;&#8722;)NiII(&#956;2&#8208;H)2NiII(bpy&#8901;&#8722;) as the active catalyst. MOF&#8208;NiH efficiently catalyzed selective hydrogenation reactions with turnover numbers of up to 192 and could be used in five cycles of hydrogenation reactions without catalyst leaching or significant decrease of catalytic activities. The present work uncovers a synthetic strategy toward solution&#8208;inaccessible Earth&#8208;abundant bimetallic MOF catalysts for sustainable catalysis.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(bpy&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) (bipyridine (bpy)), on MOF-253 yield a catalyst that efficiently semihydrogenates alkynes to afford (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-stilbenes and selectively hydrogenates C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many monometallic active sites have been installed in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalytic reactions, there are no effective strategies to generate bimetallic catalysts in MOFs. Here we report the synthesis of a robust, efficient, and reusable MOF catalyst, MOF-NiH, by adaptively generating and stabilizing dinickel active sites using the bipyridine groups in MOF-253 with the formula of Al(OH)(2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-5,5&#8242;-dicarboxylate) for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes and selective hydrogenation of C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Spectroscopic studies established the dinickel complex (bpy&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(bpy&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) as the active catalyst. MOF-NiH efficiently catalyzed selective hydrogenation reactions with turnover numbers of up to 192 and could be used in five cycles of hydrogenation reactions without catalyst leaching or significant decrease of catalytic activities. The present work uncovers a synthetic strategy toward solution-inaccessible Earth-abundant bimetallic MOF catalysts for sustainable catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Dendritic Hyperbranched Polyacrylates and Their Topological Block Polymers by Organotellurium&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization in Water

         <dc:description>
Copolymerization of a vinyl telluride and butyl acrylate (BA) using organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) under emulsion conditions afforded structurally controlled hyperbranched poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) as polymer particles dispersed in water. Various block copolymers consisting of different topologies were successfully synthesized using macro&#8208;TERP CTA with linear and HB structures.







Abstract
The practical synthesis of structurally controlled hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) by organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) in water under emulsion conditions is reported. Copolymerization of vinyltelluride named evolmer, which induces controlled branch structure, and acrylates with TERP chain transfer agent (CTA) in water afforded HBPs having dendron structure. The molecular weight, dispersity, branch number, and branch length of the HBPs were controlled by changing the amount of CTA, evolmer, and acrylate monomers. HB&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) with up to the 8th generation having an average of 255 branches were successfully synthesized. As the monomer conversion reached nearly quantitative and the obtained polymer particles were well dispersed in water, the method is highly suitable for synthesizing topological block polymers, block polymers consisting of different topologies. Thus, linear&#8208;block&#8208;HB, HB&#8208;block&#8208;linear, and HB&#8208;block&#8208;HB&#8208;PBAs with the controlled structure were successfully synthesized by adding the second monomer(s) to the macro&#8208;CTA. The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting homo&#8208; and topological block PBAs was systematically controlled by the degree of the branch, the branch length, and the topology. Therefore, the method opens the possibility of obtaining various HBPs with diverse branch structures and tuning the polymer properties by the polymer topology.

         <title>Circumpentacene with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumpentacene derivative was successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations revealed that it shows an open&#8208;shell diradical character and a dominant local aromatic character. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
Circumacenes (CAs) are a distinctive type of benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons where an acene unit is completely enclosed by a layer of outer fused benzene rings. Despite their unique structures, the synthesis of CAs is challenging, and until recently, the largest CA molecule synthesized was circumanthracene. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of an extended circumpentacene derivative 1, which represents the largest CA molecule synthesized to date. Its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. It shows a unique open&#8208;shell diradical character due to the existence of extended zigzag edges, with a moderate diradical character index (y0=39.7&#8201;%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;4.47&#8197;kcal/mol). It exhibits a dominant local aromatic character with &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized in the individual aromatic sextet rings. It has a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion can be considered as doubly charged structures in which two coronene units are fused with a central aromatic benzene ring. This study provides a new route toward stable multizigzag&#8208;edged graphene&#8208;like molecules with open&#8208;shell di/polyradical character.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Ion Conductor with Weakened Li Ion Solvation Enables Room Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEO&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from huge interfacial resistance, poor Li+ transport, and Li dendrite formation in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) operating at around room&#8208;temperature. This work proposes the regulation of the Li+ solvation environment through halogen&#8208;bonding interaction and highlights the importance of &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ in solid electrolytes for room temperature ASSLMBs.







Abstract
Improved durability, enhanced interfacial stability, and room temperature applicability are desirable properties for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), yet these desired properties are rarely achieved simultaneously. Here, in this work, it is noticed that the huge resistance at Li metal/electrolyte interface dominantly impeded the normal cycling of ASSLMBs especially at around room temperature (&lt;30&#8201;&#176;C). Accordingly, a supramolecular polymer ion conductor (SPC) with &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ was prepared. Benefiting from the halogen&#8208;bonding interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient iodine atom (on 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene) and electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms (on ethylene oxide), the O&#8208;Li+ coordination was significantly weakened. Therefore, the SPC achieves rapid Li+ transport with high Li+ transference number, and importantly, derives a unique Li2O&#8208;rich SEI with low interfacial resistance on lithium metal surface, therefore enabling stable cycling of ASSLMBs even down to 10&#8201;&#176;C. This work is a new exploration of halogen&#8208;bonding chemistry in solid polymer electrolyte and highlights the importance of &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ in the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for room temperature ASSLMBs.

         <title>Luminescent Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Dual Magneto&#8208;Optical Molecular Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual magneto&#8208;optical thermometer is demonstrated using a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnet. A multiparametric approach based on the independent magneto&#8208;optical readouts makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometer, allowing the limitations inherent to Boltzmann thermometers to be overcome.







Abstract
Luminescent thermometry allows the remote detection of the temperature and holds great potential in future technological applications in which conventional systems could not operate. Complementary approaches to measuring the temperature aiming to enhance the thermal sensitivity would however represent a decisive step forward. For the first time, we demonstrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that luminescence thermometry could be associated with a complementary temperature readout related to a different property. Namely, we propose to take advantage of the temperature dependence of both magnetic (canonical susceptibility and relaxation time) and luminescence features (emission intensity) found in Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (SMM) to develop original dual magneto&#8208;optical molecular thermometers to conciliate high&#8208;performance SMM and Boltzmann&#8208;type luminescence thermometry. We highlight this integrative approach to concurrent luminescent and magnetic thermometry using an air&#8208;stable benchmark SMM [Dy(bbpen)Cl] (H2bbpen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethyl&#8208;enediamine)) exhibiting Dy3+ luminescence. The synergy between multiparametric magneto&#8208;optical readouts and multiple linear regression makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometer over the whole temperature range, compared with the values obtained with the single optical or magnetic devices.

Namely, we propose to take advantage of the temperature dependence of both magnetic (canonical susceptibility and relaxation time) and luminescence features (emission intensity) found in Single-Molecule Magnets (SMM) to develop original dual magneto-optical molecular thermometers to conciliate high-performance SMM and Boltzmann-type luminescence thermometry. We highlight this integrative approach to concurrent luminescent and magnetic thermometry using an air-stable benchmark SMM [Dy(bbpen)Cl] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bbpen=N,N&#8242;-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N&#8242;-bis(2-methylpyridyl)ethyl-enediamine)) exhibiting Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; luminescence. The synergy between multiparametric magneto-optical readouts and multiple linear regression makes possible a 10-fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometer over the whole temperature range, compared with the values obtained with the single optical or magnetic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Amine Synthesis via Iterative Boron Homologation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable amine synthesis is realized through sequential insertion of nitrogen and carbon atoms into boronate C&#8722;B bonds. This strategy is enabled by a new nitrenoid reagent, which allows for direct formation of aminoboranes from aryl or alkyl boronates via N&#8208;insertion.







Abstract
The value of Matteson&#8208;type reactions has been increasingly recognized for developing automated organic synthesis. However, the typical Matteson reactions almost exclusively focus on homologation of carbon units. Here, we report the detailed development of sequential insertion of nitrogen and carbon atoms into boronate C&#8722;B bonds, which provides a modular and iterative approach to access functionalized tertiary amines. A new class of nitrenoid reagents is uncovered to allow direct formation of aminoboranes from aryl or alkyl boronates via N&#8208;insertion. The one&#8208;pot N&#8208;insertion followed by controlled mono&#8208; or double&#8208;carbenoid insertion has been realized with widely available aryl boronates. The resulting aminoalkyl boronate products can undergo further homologation and various other transformations. Preliminary success on homologation of N,N&#8208;dialkylaminoboranes and sequential N&#8208; and C&#8208;insertions with alkyl boronates have also been achieved. To broaden the synthetic utility, selective removal of a benzyl or aryl substituent permits access to secondary or primary amine products. The application of this method has been demonstrated in the modular synthesis of bioactive compounds and the programmable construction of diamines and aminoethers. A plausible reaction mechanism, supported by preliminary NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and computational studies, is also proposed.

         <title>Strengthening Aqueous Electrolytes without Strengthening Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By examining liquid electrolytes that are more redox&#8208;inert at low temperatures, we postulate that the solvation energy of OH&#8722; and H+ also plays an essential role in water's electrolytic properties. This insight reshapes the current understanding of the water stability window and may guide the development of next&#8208;generation aqueous batteries for broader applications, providing affordable and clean energy to society in the future.







Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes typically suffer from poor electrochemical stability; however, eutectic aqueous solutions&#8212;25&#8197;wt.% LiCl and 62&#8197;wt.% H3PO4&#8212;cooled to &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C exhibit a significantly widened stability window. Integrated experimental and simulation results reveal that, upon cooling, Li+ ions become less hydrated and pair up with Cl&#8722;, ice&#8208;like water clusters form, and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; bonding strengthens. Surprisingly, this low&#8208;temperature solvation structure does not strengthen water molecules&#8217; O&#8722;H bond, bucking the conventional wisdom that increasing water's stability requires stiffening the O&#8722;H covalent bond. We propose a more general mechanism for water's low temperature inertness in the electrolyte: less favorable solvation of OH&#8722; and H+, the byproducts of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. To showcase this stability, we demonstrate an aqueous Li&#8208;ion battery using LiMn2O4 cathode and CuSe anode with a high energy density of 109&#8197;Wh/kg. These results highlight the potential of aqueous batteries for polar and extraterrestrial missions.

         <title>Multiple Dynamic Bonds&#8208;Driven Integrated Cathode/Polymer Electrolyte for Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated cathode/ultrathin polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed driven by multiple dynamic bonds in a dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomer (DSICE), thus achieving minimum thickness of pure polymer electrolyte and maximum compatibility of the solid electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interface at the molecular level. The well&#8208;constructed cells present superior cycling stability, excellent flexibility and safety.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as the promising higher&#8208;energy and improved&#8208;safety energy&#8208;storage systems. Nevertheless, the electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial issues due to the limited solid physical contact lead to discontinuous interfacial charge transport and large interfacial resistance, thereby suffering from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we construct an integrated cathode/polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs under the action of polymer chains exchange and recombination originating from multiple dynamic bonds in our well&#8208;designed dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE) molecular structure. The DSICE acts as polymer electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, achieving the ultrathin pure polymer electrolyte thickness (12&#8197;&#956;m). Notably, the DSICE also functions as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathode binders with enhanced adhesive capability. Such well&#8208;constructed Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE cells generate delicate electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial contact at the molecular level, providing continuous Li+ transport pathways and promoting uniform Li+ deposition, further delivering superior long&#8208;term charge/discharge stability (&gt;600&#8197;cycles, Coulombic efficiency, &gt;99.8&#8201;%) and high capacity retention (80&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles). More practically, the Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE pouch cells show stable electrochemical performance, excellent flexibility and safety under abusive tests.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Activation of Hydroxyl Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxyl polymer PTFHQ has been designed to obtain electrochemical activity through an in situ electrochemical activation process. The synergistic effects of the different functional groups (C=O, &#8722;OH, and &#8722;S&#8722;) and the unique Z&#8208;folded structure of the activated PTFHQ effectively improve its electrochemical activity and contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics, realizing the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;organic batteries.







Abstract
The slow reaction kinetics and structural instability of organic electrode materials limit the further performance improvement of aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we have synthesized a Z&#8208;folded hydroxyl polymer polytetrafluorohydroquinone (PTFHQ) with inert hydroxyl groups that could be partially oxidized to the active carbonyl groups through the in situ activation process and then undertake the storage/release of Zn2+. In the activated PTFHQ, the hydroxyl groups and S atoms enlarge the electronegativity region near the electrochemically active carbonyl groups, enhancing their electrochemical activity. Simultaneously, the residual hydroxyl groups could act as hydrophilic groups to enhance the electrolyte wettability while ensuring the stability of the polymer chain in the electrolyte. Also, the Z&#8208;folded structure of PTFHQ plays an important role in reversible binding with Zn2+ and fast ion diffusion. All these benefits make the activated PTFHQ exhibit a high specific capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 3400 stable cycles with a capacity retention of 92&#8201;%, and an outstanding rate capability of 196&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Chemical Approach Towards Broadband Spintronics on Nanoscale Pyrene Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically grafted pyrene oligomer is deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO), under a varied&#8208;thickness permalloy, to study broadband spintronics. High spin&#8208;mixing conductance and linewidth broadening reveal that pyrene can be an attractive nonmagnetic element for efficient spin&#8208;pumping at room temperature, a striking alternative to conventional but expensive heavy metals.







Abstract
The injection of pure spin current into the non&#8208;magnetic layer plays a crucial role in transmitting, processing, and storing data information in the realm of spintronics. To understand broadband molecular spintronics, pyrene oligomer film (&#8776;20&#8197;nm thickness) was prepared using an electrochemical method forming indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode/pyrene covalent interfaces. Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) films with different nanoscale thicknesses were used as top contact over ITO/pyrene layers to estimate the spin pumping efficiency across the interfaces using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectra. The spintronic devices are composed of permalloy/pyrene/ITO orthogonal configuration, showing remarkable spin pumping from permalloy to pyrene film. The large spin pumping is evident from the linewidth broadening of 5.4&#8197;mT at 9&#8197;GHz, which is direct proof of spin angular momentum transfer across the interface. A striking observation is made with the high spin&#8208;mixing conductance of &#8776;1.02&#215;1018&#8197;m&#8722;2, a value comparable to the conventional heavy metals. Large spin angular moment transfer was observed at the permalloy&#8208;pyrene interfaces, especially at the lower thickness of permalloy, indicating a strong spinterface effect. Pure spin current injection from ferromagnetic into electrochemically grown pyrene films ensures efficient broadband spin transport, which opens a new area in molecular broadband spintronics.

         <title>Hybrid Double Perovskite Derived Halides Based on Bi and Alkali Metals (K, Rb): Diverse Structures, Tunable Optical Properties and Second Harmonic Generation Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
15 double perovskite derived halides A2BBiX6 are reported here, composed of organic cationic ligand A, forming diverse novel structures varying in dimensionalities. Various combinations of A, B and X create new structural types and tunable optical properties, where two&#8208;thirds of these phases are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and second&#8208;harmonic generation active.







Abstract
Double perovskites (DP) have attracted extensive attention due to their rich structures and wide application prospects in the field of optoelectronics. Here, we report 15 new Bi&#8208;based double perovskite derived halides with the general formula of A2BBiX6 (A=organic cationic ligand, B=K or Rb, X=Br or I). These materials are synthesized using organic ligands to coordinate with metal ions with a sp3 oxygen, and diverse structure types have been obtained with distinct dimensionalities and connectivity modes. The optical band gaps of these phases can be tuned by changing the halide, the organic ligand and the alkali metal, varying from 2.0 to 2.9&#8197;eV. The bromide phases exhibit increasing photoluminescence (PL) intensity with decreasing temperature, while the PL intensity of iodide phases changes nonmonotonically with temperature. Because the majority of these phases are non&#8208;centrosymmetric, second harmonic generation (SHG) responses are also measured for selected non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, showing different particle&#8208;size&#8208;dependent trends. Our findings give rise to a series of new structural types to the DP family, and provide a powerful synthetic handle for symmetry breaking.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Quinoidal Compounds with Good Air Stability and High Electrical Conductivity for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone has been used to develop self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules (QnNs) with high electrical conductivities and good air stability. Intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone was found to result in the self&#8208;doping. Applying the QnNs as the cathode interlayer (CIL) in organic solar cells led to an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 18.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Air stable n&#8208;type conductive molecules with high electrical conductivities and excellent device performance have important applications in organic electronics, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report three self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules, designated QnNs, with a closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone and alkyl amino chains of different lengths. The QnNs are self&#8208;doped by intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone. This process is ascertained unambiguously by experiments and theoretical calculations. The use of a quinoidal structure effectively improves the self&#8208;doping level, and thus increases the electrical conductivity of self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules achieved by a closed&#8208;shell structure from&lt;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 to&gt;0.03&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure results in good air stability of the QnNs, with half&#8208;lives&gt;73&#8197;days; and Q4N shows an electrical conductivity of 0.019&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even after exposure to air for 120&#8197;days. When applying Q6N as the cathode interlayer in organic solar cells (OSCs), an outstanding power conversion efficiency of up to 18.2&#8201;% was obtained, which represents one the best results in binary OSCs.

         <title>Improved Thermal and Chemical Stability of Oxynitride Phosphor from Facile Chemical Synthesis for Vehicle Cornering Lights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxynitride SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ derived from the nitride SrAlSi4N7:Eu2+ is not only accessible by facile synthesis from air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, AlN and Si3N4 but also achieves zero&#8208;thermal quenching, due to oxygen vacancies. Additionally, the SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphor shows high chemical stabilities against heat and water immersion.







Abstract
Orange Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors are essential for light&#8208;emitting diodes for cornering lights to prevent fatal road accidents at night, but such phosphors require features of high thermal, chemical stability and facile synthesis. This study reports a series of yellow&#8208;orange&#8208;red emitting SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ oxynitride phosphors, derived from the SrAlSi4N7 nitride iso&#8208;structure by replacing Si4+&#8722;N3&#8722; with Al3+&#8722;O2&#8722;. The introduction of a certain amount of oxygen enabled the facile synthesis under atmospheric pressure using the air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, Eu2O3, AlN and Si3N4. SrAl2Si3ON6 has a smaller band gap and lower structure rigidity than SrAlSi4N7 (5.19&#8197;eV vs 5.50&#8197;eV, Debye temperature 719&#8197;K vs 760&#8197;K), but exhibits higher thermal stability with 100&#8201;% of room temperature intensity remaining at 150&#8201;&#176;C compared to 85&#8201;% for SrAlSi4N7. Electron paramagnetic resonance, thermoluminescence and density functional theory revealed that the oxygen vacancy electron traps compensated the thermal loss. Additionally, no decrease in emission intensity was found after either being heated at 500&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;hours or being immersed in water for 20&#8197;days, implying both of the thermal and chemical stability of SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphors. The strategy of oxynitride&#8208;introduction from nitride promotes the development of low&#8208;cost thermally and chemically stable luminescent materials.

The introduction of a certain amount of oxygen enabled the facile synthesis under atmospheric pressure using the air-stable raw materials SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AlN and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ON&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has a smaller band gap and lower structure rigidity than SrAlSi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (5.19&#8197;eV &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 5.50&#8197;eV, Debye temperature 719&#8197;K &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 760&#8197;K), but exhibits higher thermal stability with 100&#8201;% of room temperature intensity remaining at 150&#8201;&#176;C compared to 85&#8201;% for SrAlSi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Electron paramagnetic resonance, thermoluminescence and density functional theory revealed that the oxygen vacancy electron traps compensated the thermal loss. Additionally, no decrease in emission intensity was found after either being heated at 500&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;hours or being immersed in water for 20&#8197;days, implying both of the thermal and chemical stability of SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ON&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphors. The strategy of oxynitride-introduction from nitride promotes the development of low-cost thermally and chemically stable luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Aided Thermoelectric Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the Soret effect of protons and the classical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (H2Q) in hydrogels results in overall and giant thermoelectric performance in terms of the thermopower, ionic conductivity, power factor, ionic Figure of merit. Above all, an energy&#8208;storage function is achieved by the BQ and H2Q redox couple after the removal of temperature difference.







Abstract
Low&#8208;grade heat is ubiquitous in the environment and its thermoelectric conversion by the ionic conductors remains a challenge because of the low efficiency and poor sustainability. Here we demonstrate that the thermoelectric performances can be boosted by combining the Soret effect of protons and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of benzoquinone and hydroquinone in hydrogels. An overall enhancement of thermopower (25.9&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1), power factor (5&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), figure of merit (&gt;2.4) and continuity of power output is achieved. Moreover, an energy&#8208;storage function can be achieved by the redox couple, and a retained power output of 27.7&#8201;%, or 14&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 for more than 3&#8197;hours is obtained by the re&#8208;balance of PCET reactants in the hydrogel after the removal of the temperature gradient.

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes: Efficient and Simple Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese(I) complexes bearing simple, non&#8208;bifunctional bis(NHC) ligands were investigated as hydrogenation catalysts. Applying these complexes with KHBEt3 as additive, various carboxylic acid esters and, additionally, ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes were successfully hydrogenated. Mechanistic investigations by control experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.







Abstract
The use of bis(NHC) manganese(I) complexes&#8197;3 as catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters was investigated. For that purpose, a series of complexes has been synthesized via an improved two step procedure utilizing bis(NHC)&#8208;BEt3 adducts. By applying complexes&#8197;3 with KHBEt3 as additive, various aromatic and aliphatic esters were hydrogenated successfully at mild temperatures and low catalyst loadings, highlighting the efficiency of the novel catalytic system. The versatility of the developed catalytic system was further demonstrated by the hydrogenation of other substrate classes like ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner sphere mechanism with the loss of one CO ligand and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Phase Reconstruction Enables Robust Zinc Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed and applied to commercial zinc foil anodes, which affords continuous protection on the reconstructed anode from dendrite growth and corrosion and evades surface damage induced by inhomogeneous stripping in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are inherently safe, but the severe dendrite growth and corrosion reaction on zinc anodes greatly hinder their practical applications. Most of the strategies for zinc anode modification refer to the research of lithium metal anodes on surface regulation without considering the intrinsic mechanisms of zinc anode. Herein, we first point out that surface modification cannot permanently protect zinc anodes due to the unavoidable surface damage during the stripping process by solid&#8211;liquid conversion. A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed to introduce abundant zincophilic sites both on the surface and inside the commercial zinc foils. The bulk&#8208;phase reconstructed zinc foil anodes exhibit uniform surfaces with high zincophilicity even after deep stripping, significantly improving the resistance to dendrite growth and side reactions. Our proposed strategy suggests a promising direction for the development of dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes for practical rechargeable batteries with high sustainability.

         <title>Base&#8208;Modulated 1,3&#8208;Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carboboration of Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing two remote functional groups into rings via chain&#8208;walking represents a new strategy to efficiently access multi&#8208;substituted saturated cyclic compounds. We report an unprecedented 1,3&#8208;cis&#8208;carboboration of cyclohexenes by nickel catalysis. The application of LiOMe as base plays a crucial role in the success of this reaction.







Abstract
While chain&#8208;walking stimulates wide interest in both polymerization and organic synthesis, site&#8208; and stereoselective control of chain&#8208;walking on rings is still a challenging task in the realm of organometallic catalysis. Inspired by a controllable chain&#8208;walking on cyclohexane rings in olefin polymerization, we have developed a set of chain&#8208;walking carboborations of cyclohexenes based on nickel catalysis. Different from the 1,4&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity disclosed in polymer science, a high level of 1,3&#8208;regio&#8208; and cis&#8208;stereoselectivity is obtained in our reactions. Mechanistically, we discovery that the base affects the reduction ability of B2pin2 and different bases lead to different catalytic cycles and different regioselective products (1,2&#8208; Vs 1,3&#8208;addition). This study provides a concise and modular method for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexylboron compounds. The incorporation of a readily modifiable boronate group greatly enhances the value of this method, the synthetic potential of which was highlighted by the synthesis of a series of high&#8208;valued commercial chemicals and pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wagner&#8211;Meerwein Rearrangements with Concomitant Nucleophilic Hydrofluorination</title>

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reaction has been developed, which proceeds via hydrogen atom transfer and radical&#8208;polar crossover steps, to form a phenonium ion under non&#8208;acidic conditions. This cationic intermediate can be regioselectively fluorinated by a tetrafluoroborate anion to give 1,2&#8208;aryl migrated products. Evaluation of distinctly substituted phenonium ion intermediates demonstrated the constraints for good reactivity and high selectivity.







Abstract
We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of gem&#8208;disubstituted allylarenes that generates fluoroalkane products with isolated yields up to 84&#8201;%. Modification of the counteranion of the N&#8208;fluoropyridinium oxidant suggests the substrates undergo nucleophilic fluorination during the reaction. Subjecting the substrates to other known metal&#8208;mediated hydrofluorination procedures did not lead to observable 1,2&#8208;aryl migration. Thus, indicating the unique ability of these cobalt&#8208;catalyzed conditions to generate a sufficiently reactive electrophilic intermediate capable of promoting this Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement.

         <title>Low Pressure Carbonylation of Benzyl Carbonates and Carbamates for Applications in 13C Isotope Labeling and Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an oxygen atom deletion strategy via sequential Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative carbonylation of carbonates and carbamates to afford esters and amides is reported. Operating under low pressures (near stoichiometric or substoichiometric), either 13C labeled products are accessed or a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that CO2 formed upon decarboxylation can be reduced in situ and reincorporated as CO is shown.







Abstract
Herein, we report a methodology to access isotopically labeled esters and amides from carbonates and carbamates employing an oxygen deletion strategy. This methodology utilizes a decarboxylative carbonylation approach for isotope labeling with near stoichiometric, ex situ generated 12C, or 13C carbon monoxide. This reaction is characterized by its broad scope, functional group tolerance, and high yields, which is showcased with the synthesis of structurally complex molecules. A complementary method that operates by the catalytic in situ generation of CO via the reduction of CO2 liberated during decarboxylation has also been developed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach that CO2&#8208;derived compounds can be converted to CO&#8208;containing frameworks. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the catalytic steps which highlight the impact of ligand choice to overcome challenges associated with low&#8208;pressure carbonylation methodologies, along with rational for the development of future methodologies.

         <title>Size&#8208; and Emission&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Full&#8208;Color Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Tryptophan Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs), with precise size control and emission colors from blue to near&#8208;infrared, were prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative based ditopic&#8208; and tetratopic carboxylic acids as the emission sources. The nano&#8208;LMOFs exhibit turn&#8208;off and turn&#8208;on responses for highly selective and sensitive detection of tryptophan over nineteen other natural amino acids.







Abstract
The development of nanoscaled luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nano&#8208;LMOFs) with organic linker&#8208;based emission to explore their applications in sensing, bioimaging and photocatalysis is of great interest as material size and emission wavelength both have remarkable influence on their performances. However, there is lack of platforms that can systematically tune the emission and size of nano&#8208;LMOFs with customized linker design. Herein two series of fcu&#8208; and csq&#8208;type nano&#8208;LMOFs, with precise size control in a broad range and emission colors from blue to near&#8208;infrared, were prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative based ditopic&#8208; and tetratopic carboxylic acids as the emission sources. The modification of tetratopic carboxylic acids using OH and NH2 as the substituent groups not only induces significant emission bathochromic shift of the resultant MOFs, but also endows interesting features for their potential applications. As one example, we show that the non&#8208;substituted and NH2&#8208;substituted nano&#8208;LMOFs exhibit turn&#8208;off and turn&#8208;on responses for highly selective and sensitive detection of tryptophan over other nineteen natural amino acids. This work sheds light on the rational construction of nano&#8208;LMOFs with specific emission behaviours and sizes, which will undoubtedly facilitate their applications in related areas.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Control of Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light Transparency Based on Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Association of Tetrathiafulvalene Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble consisting of the solid form of the tetrathiafulvalene radical cation and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide showed rapid and reversible changes in short&#8208;wave infrared light (&gt;1000&#8197;nm) transparency upon weak external stimulation. This behavior originated from the conversion of the association structures of the radical cation from columnar arrangements of &#960;&#8208;dimers into isolated &#960;&#8208;dimers.







Abstract
The light&#8208;transmissive properties of a solid&#8208;state tetrathiafulvalene radical cation&#8208;bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 1&#8208;C5&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NTf2&#8722;, underwent instantaneous changes in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region (1000&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) upon exposure to solvent vapor or the application of mechanostress at room temperature. The initial solid state of 1&#8208;C5&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NTf2&#8722; exhibited strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 700&#8211;1000&#8197;nm) and SWIR regions, whereas the absorption in the SWIR region was significantly diminished in the stimulated state induced by dichloromethane vapor. Upon cessation of vapor stimulation, the solid state spontaneously and promptly reverted to its original state, characterized by absorption bands in the NIR/SWIR region. Moreover, the SWIR absorption was absent upon the application of mechanical stress using a steel spatula. The reversal was fast and occurred within 10&#8197;s. These changes were visualized using a SWIR imaging camera under 1450&#8208;nm light irradiation. Experimental investigations demonstrated that the transparency to the SWIR light in the solid states was modulated through significant structural transformations of the associated radical cations, with transitions between columnar and isolated &#960;&#8208;dimer structures under ambient and stimulated conditions, respectively.

         <title>Association of Radical Chemistry with LanD Flavoprotein Activity for C&#8208;Terminal Macrocyclization of a Ribosomal Peptide by Formation of an Unsaturated Thioether Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce a reactive enethiol. This enzyme activity can couple with radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoylcysteine, by conjugation of the enethiol with C&#946; of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization.







Abstract
LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce an enethiol. This enethiol is highly reactive and can be coupled with an upstream dehydroamino acid through Michael addition to form S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl](3&#8208;methyl)cysteine, an unsaturated thioether residue known to be characteristic of an array of C&#8208;terminally macrocyclized, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on a two&#8208;stage bioinformatics mining of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) related to C&#8208;terminal Cys processing, we report herein that LanD activity can couple with radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoylcysteine, by conjugating the resultant enethiol with C&#946; of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization.

&lt;p&gt;LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce a reactive enethiol.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the &lt;i&gt;C-t&lt;/i&gt;erminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce an enethiol. This enethiol is highly reactive and can be coupled with an upstream dehydroamino acid through Michael addition to form &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-[2-aminovinyl](3-methyl)cysteine, an unsaturated thioether residue known to be characteristic of an array of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminally macrocyclized, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on a two-stage bioinformatics mining of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) related to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal Cys processing, we report herein that LanD activity can couple with radical &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-[2-aminovinyl]-3-carbamoylcysteine, by conjugating the resultant enethiol with C&#946; of the Asn residue in the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization. This study furthers our understanding of the variety of PTMs involved in creating the structure diversity of macrocyclic RiPPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Ni(Co)&#8208;Ru&#8208;P Sites Activate Dehydrogenation for Hydrazine Oxidation Assisting Self&#8208;powered H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique atomic Ni(Co)&#8722;Ru&#8722;P interfacial sites on a matrix of NiCoP nanowire arrays were designed as highly active and stable catalysts for alkaline hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A self&#8208;powered H2 production system utilizing an overall hydrazine splitting device driven by a direct hydrazine fuel cell achieved a promising rate of 24.0&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Water electrolysis for H2 production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using the thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever&#8208;growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire array immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru1&#8722;NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of &#8722;60&#8197;mV and overpotential of 32&#8197;mV for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Inspiringly, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record&#8208;high current density of 522&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at cell voltage of 0.3&#8197;V. DFT calculations elucidate the cooperative Ni(Co)&#8722;Ru&#8722;P sites in Ru1&#8722;NiCoP optimize H* adsorption, and enhance adsorption of *N2H2 to significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrazine dehydrogenation. Moreover, a self&#8208;powered H2 production system utilizing OHzS device driven by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) achieve a satisfactory rate of 24.0&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Mediated Water Dynamics Enables On&#8208;Demand Transport of Sugar Molecules in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels</title>

Electrochemical manipulation of the water dynamics within the nanochannels of the multilayered Ti3C2Tx membrane enables the on/off switching of glucose transport.







Abstract
The constructing of artificial channels with gating functions is an important undertaking for gaining insight into biological process and achieving efficient bionic functions. Typically, controllable transport within such channels relies on either electrostatic or specific interactions between the transporting species and the channel. However, for molecules with weak interactions with the channel, achieving precise gating of the transport remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this study proposes a voltage gating membrane of two&#8208;dimensional channels that selectively transport of neutral molecules glucose with a dimension of 0.60&#8197;nm. The permeation of glucose is switched on/off by electrochemically manipulating the water dynamics in the nanochannel. Voltage driven&#8208;intercalation of ion into the two&#8208;dimensional channel causes water to stratify and move closer to the channel walls, thereby resulting in the channel center being emptier for glucose diffusion. Due to the sub&#8208;nanometer size dimension of the channel, selective permeation of glucose over sucrose is also achieved in this approach.

         <title>A Paramagnetic Compass Based on Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) crystals show unexpected compass&#8208;like alignments at low fields (&#8764;mT). The magnetic alignments originate from the symmetry&#8208;related summation of Ln&#8208;ions&#8217; molecular anisotropy, among which the perpendicular, parallel, and inclined alignments can be manipulated and switched by crystal structures and chemical environments.







Abstract
Macroscopic compass&#8208;like magnetic alignment at low magnetic fields is natural for ferromagnetic materials but is seldomly observed in paramagnetic materials. Herein, we report a &#8220;paramagnetic compass&#8221; that magnetically aligns under &#8764;mT fields based on the single&#8208;crystalline framework constructed by lanthanide ions and organic ligands (Ln&#8208;MOF). The magnetic alignment is attributed to the Ln&#8208;MOF's strong macroscopic anisotropy, where the highly&#8208;ordered structure allows the Ln&#8208;ions&#8217; molecular anisotropy to be summed according to the crystal symmetry. In tetragonal Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignment is either parallel or perpendicular to the field depending on the easiest axis of the molecular anisotropy. Reversible switching between the two alignments is realized upon the removal and re&#8208;adsorption of solvent molecules filled in the framework. When the crystal symmetry is lowered in monoclinic Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignments become even inclined (47&#176;&#8208;66&#176;) to the field. These fascinating properties of Ln&#8208;MOFs would encourage further explorations of framework materials containing paramagnetic centers.

Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals are reported by Ken&#8208;ichi Otake, Susumu Kitagawa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303903). These nanocrystals combine soft porosity and electrical properties into a single material. They exhibit semiconductive soft porous interfaces that connect a flexible core and a chemiresistive shell. The cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF nanocrystals demonstrate enhanced selective sorption towards CO2, as well as readable softness, electrical gating, and shape memory effects for the guest&#8208;responsive iMOF core.

         <title>Cover Picture: Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2 (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#160;(100) surface , despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2&#160;(100) surface. This ordered water layer creates a key&#8208;lock H&#8208;bond pattern with the underlying surface hydroxyl groups, hindering the interactions with liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water, as reported by Lorenzo Agosta, Kersti Hermansson et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202303910). We acknowledge Virginia Carnevali for her help with the cover image.

A photosensitizing covalent metal&#8211;organic framework (CMOF) was prepared as a tandem reaction catalyst by Guo&#8208;Hong Ning, Dan Li, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202306497). By combining Cu&#8208;CTUs as metal&#8208;catalytic sites and Bodipy linkers as photosensitizers, this CMOF can catalyze terminal alkenes and alkynes to produce primary alcohols via one&#8208;pot tandem reactions with excellent regioselectivity, good overall yields for two&#8208;step reactions, broad substrate compatibility and good reusability under mild conditions.

         <title>Ferroptosis Detection: From Approaches to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically summarize the ferroptosis detection approaches for subcellular organelles, biological events, and chemical markers, providing a multi&#8208;scale perspective on the regulation of the molecular machinery of ferroptosis. Moreover, we highlight the potential of advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection techniques with multifunctional platforms. The development of these applications holds great promise in promoting the transition of ferroptosis research from bench to bedside.







Abstract
Understanding the intricate molecular machinery that governs ferroptosis and leveraging this accumulating knowledge could facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Emerging approaches for the in situ detection of the major regulators and biological events across cellular, tissue, and in living subjects provide a multiscale perspective for studying ferroptosis. Furthermore, advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection and the latest technologies hold tremendous promise in ferroptosis research. In this review, we first briefly summarize the mechanisms and key regulators underlying ferroptosis. Ferroptosis detection approaches are then presented to delineate their design, mechanisms of action, and applications. Special interest is placed on advanced ferroptosis applications that integrate multifunctional platforms.

     alt="Ferroptosis Detection: From Approaches to Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically summarize the ferroptosis detection approaches for subcellular organelles, biological events, and chemical markers, providing a multi-scale perspective on the regulation of the molecular machinery of ferroptosis. Moreover, we highlight the potential of advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection techniques with multifunctional platforms. The development of these applications holds great promise in promoting the transition of ferroptosis research from bench to bedside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intricate molecular machinery that governs ferroptosis and leveraging this accumulating knowledge could facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Emerging approaches for the in situ detection of the major regulators and biological events across cellular, tissue, and in living subjects provide a multiscale perspective for studying ferroptosis. Furthermore, advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection and the latest technologies hold tremendous promise in ferroptosis research. In this review, we first briefly summarize the mechanisms and key regulators underlying ferroptosis. Ferroptosis detection approaches are then presented to delineate their design, mechanisms of action, and applications. Special interest is placed on advanced ferroptosis applications that integrate multifunctional platforms. Finally, we discuss the prospects and challenges of ferroptosis detection approaches and applications, with the aim of providing a roadmap for the theranostic development of a broad range of ferroptosis-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrode Materials for Desalination of Water via Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers a detailed overview of the porous electrode materials utilized in CDI and mCDI for water desalination. While being an efficient and energy economical process, CDI and mCDI face certain challenges concerning their relatively low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions. To address these issues, this review discusses various cell architectures, electrode materials, and the use of standard experimental parameters that aim to enhance desalination performance.







Abstract
Recent years have seen the emergence of capacitive deionization (CDI) as a promising desalination technique for converting sea and wastewater into potable water, due to its energy efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, its low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions have limited its effectiveness. As a result, the development of porous carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials have been explored, while taking into account of material characteristics such as morphology, wettability, high conductivity, chemical robustness, cyclic stability, specific surface area, and ease of production. To tackle the parasitic reaction issue, membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) was proposed which utilizes ion&#8208;exchange membranes coupled to the electrode. Fabrication techniques along with the experimental parameters used to evaluate the desalination performance of different materials are discussed in this review to provide an overview of improvements made for CDI and mCDI desalination purposes

         <title>When Weak Is Strong: A Plea for Low&#8208;Affinity Binders for Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein labeling is a cornerstone of fluorescence microscopy. This is achieved using covalent or high&#8208;affinity target labels, which leads to a loss in fluorescence signal with time. Here, we highlight the new avenue of using reversible fluorophore labels, which exhibit a low binding affinity to their target and constantly &#8220;renew&#8221; the fluorescence signal. This enables novel biophysical applications across imaging platforms.







Abstract
The exploitation of low&#8208;affinity molecular interactions in protein labeling is an emerging topic in optical microscopy. Such non&#8208;covalent and low&#8208;affinity interactions can be realized with various concepts from chemistry and for different molecule classes, and lead to a constant renewal of fluorescence signals at target sites. Further benefits are a versatile use across microscopy methods, in 3D, live and many&#8208;target applications. In recent years, several classes of low&#8208;affinity labels were developed and a variety of powerful applications demonstrated. Still, this research field is underdeveloped, while the potential is huge.

         <title>Diazoalkenes: From an Elusive Intermediate to a Stable Substance Class in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early discoveries of diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) in organic synthesis and the identification of room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes since 2021 are summarized in this Minireview. The synthesis, properties, and reactivity of this novel molecule class are presented, and its use in organic synthesis, main&#8208;group, and transition&#8208;metal chemistry highlighted.







Abstract
Over decades diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) were postulated as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry even though their direct spectroscopic detection proved very challenging. In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix&#8208;isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room&#8208;temperature stable derivatives.

         <title>Toward a Formyl&#8208;to&#8208;Phenyl Conversion: An Unexpected Photochemical Fulvene Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction sequence toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes involving a fulvene and a Dewar benzene derivative as intermediates was designed and studied computationally. Irradiation of different fulvenes results in an unusual photoisomerization and leads to spiro[2.4]heptadienes.







Abstract
Toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes, we designed a sequence involving the initial reaction of an aldehyde to give a fulvene, followed by photochemical and platinum&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements into a Dewar benzene derivative, which finally isomerizes into the targeted arene. While computational studies support the plausibility of this route, we found that fulvene irradiation resulted in an unexpected isomerization into a spiro[2.4]heptadiene. This unusual photorearrangement has been investigated mechanistically and provides access to a variety of spiro[2.4]heptadienes with different substituents.

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that the CeO2(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2(100) surface, and it is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water.







Abstract
The nature of the hydrophobicity found in rare&#8208;earth oxides is intriguing. The CeO2 (100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. In order to understand this puzzling and counter&#8208;intuitive effect we performed a detailed analysis of the confined water structure and dynamics. We report here an ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) study which demonstrates that the first adsorbed water layer, in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2 surface, generates a hydrophobic interface with respect to the rest of the liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested in several ways: a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water at the same thermodynamic condition, a weak adhesion energy and few H&#8208;bonds above the hydrophobic water layer, which may also sustain a water droplet. These findings introduce a new concept in water/rare&#8208;earth oxide interfaces: hydrophobicity mediated by specific water patterns on a hydrophilic surface.

         <title>Directed Evolution of Piperazic Acid Incorporation by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient directed evolution protocols for nonribosomal peptide synthetases are needed to adapt the structures of antibiotic peptides for the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Here, an easily reproducible directed evolution protocol was used to reprogram the synthetase for the antibiotic peptide gramicidin S. A few mutations were sufficient to incorporate the non&#8208;standard building block piperazic acid instead of proline with perfect specificity.







Abstract
Engineering of biosynthetic enzymes is increasingly employed to synthesize structural analogues of antibiotics. Of special interest are nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) responsible for the production of important antimicrobial peptides. Here, directed evolution of an adenylation domain of a Pro&#8208;specific NRPS module completely switched substrate specificity to the non&#8208;standard amino acid piperazic acid (Piz) bearing a labile N&#8722;N bond. This success was achieved by UPLC&#8208;MS/MS&#8208;based screening of small, rationally designed mutant libraries and can presumably be replicated with a larger number of substrates and NRPS modules. The evolved NRPS produces a Piz&#8208;derived gramicidin S analogue. Thus, we give new impetus to the too&#8208;early dismissed idea that widely accessible low&#8208;throughput methods can switch the specificity of NRPSs in a biosynthetically useful fashion.

         <title>Synthesis of Cobalt&#8208;Tin and &#8208;Lead Tetrylidynes&#8212;Reactivity Study of the Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrylidynes featuring a triple bond between cobalt and tin or lead have been synthesized via a substitution reaction between anionic cobalt complex [Co(PMe3)4]&#8722; and halides of tin and lead. The cobalt stannylidyne adds two equivalents of water to give a cobalt dihydride moiety and tin dihydroxide unit. In reaction with carbon dioxide the stannylidyne forms a cobalt carbonyl complex featuring a carbonate ligand coordinated at tin.







Abstract
Tetrylidynes [TbbSn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1&#8201;a) and [TbbPb&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (2) (Tbb=2,6&#8208;[CH(SiMe3)2]2&#8208;4&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)C6H2) are accessed for the first time via a substitution reaction between [Na(OEt2)][Co(PMe3)4] and [Li(thf)2][TbbEBr2] (E=Sn, Pb). Following an alternative procedure the stannylidyne [Ar*Sn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by hydrogen atom abstraction using AIBN from the paramagnetic hydride complex [Ar*SnH=Co(PMe3)3] (4) (AIBN=azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The stannylidyne 1&#8201;a adds two equivalents of water to yield the dihydroxide [TbbSn(OH)2CoH2(PMe3)3] (5). In reaction of the stannylidyne 1&#8201;a with CO2 a product of a redox reaction [TbbSn(CO3)Co(CO)(PMe3)3] (6) was isolated. Protonation of the tetrylidynes occurs at the cobalt atom to give the metalla&#8208;stanna vinyl cation [TbbSn=CoH(PMe3)3][BArF4] (7&#8201;a) [ArF=C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2]. The analogous germanium and tin cations [Ar*E=CoH(PMe3)3][BArF4] (E=Ge 9, Sn 7&#8201;b) (Ar*=C6H3(2,6&#8208;Trip)2, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3) were also obtained by oxidation of the paramagnetic complexes [Ar*EH=Co(PMe3)3] (E=Ge 3, Sn 4), which were synthesized by substitution of a PMe3 ligand of [Co(PMe3)4] by a hydridoylene (Ar*EH) unit.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Alkylureido Imidazole Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;alkylureido&#8208;imidazoles have been used to construct artificial water channels presenting increased water transport and lower H+ translocation activities than monosubstituted I&#8208;quartets across lipid bilayers. These studies shed light on potential mechanisms of biological proton/water translocation and inspire novel designs for engineering artificial water channels membranes.







Abstract
Nature creates aquaporins to effectively transport water, rejecting all ions including protons. Aquaporins (AQPs) has brought inspiration for the development of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). Imidazole&#8208;quartet (I&#8208;quartet) was the first AWC that enabled to self&#8208;assemble a tubular backbone for rapid water and proton permeation with total ion rejection. Here, we report the discovery of bis&#8208;alkylureido imidazole compounds, which outperform the I&#8208;quartets by exhibiting &#8776;3&#8197;times higher net and single channel permeabilities (107 H2O/s/channel) and a &#8776;2&#8211;3&#8197;times lower proton conductance. The higher water conductance regime is associated to the high partition of more hydrophobic bis&#8208;alkylureido channels in the membrane and to their pore sizes, experiencing larger fluctuations, leading to an increase in the number of water molecules in the channel, with decreasing H&#8208;bonding connectivity. This new class of AWCs will open new pathways toward scalable membranes with enhanced water transport performances.

         <title>Titanium Salalen Catalyzed Enantioselective Benzylic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) Ti salalen complex (R=NO2) was shown to efficiently catalyze enantioselective benzylic hydroxylations with H2O2 as oxidant. Tetralin and indane derivatives are converted to benzylic alcohols with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The overoxidation to ketone is negligible. Epoxidation reactions are similarly effective, with 1&#8208;decene being converted to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% ee, at 0.1&#8197;mol% catalyst loading.







Abstract
The titanium complex of the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) derived Berkessel&#8208;salalen ligand is a highly efficient and enantioselective catalyst for the asymmetric epoxidation of terminal olefins with hydrogen peroxide (&#8220;Berkessel&#8208;Katsuki catalyst&#8221;). We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism&#8208;based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation efficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1&#8208;decene to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield with 94&#8201;% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol&#8208;% only.

We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism-based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro-salalen Ti-catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro-salalen Ti-catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation efficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1-decene to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield with 94&#8201;% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol-% only.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)Benzaldehydes: Atroposelective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenative Allylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A designed transient Lewis pair interaction was found to be the key to facilitate the racemization of 8&#8208;arylquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;formaldehydes and enable an iridium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, accomplished via atroposelective allylation by transfer hydrogenative coupling.







Abstract
An atroposelective Ir&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes/1&#8208;naphthaldehydes by transfer hydrogenative coupling of allyl acetate is disclosed. The allylation reaction takes place with simultaneous installation of central and axial chirality, reaching high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantiomeric excesses when ortho&#8208;cyclometalated iridium&#8208;DM&#8208;BINAP is used as the catalyst. The racemization of the substrates occurs through a designed transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the quinoline nitrogen atom and the aldehyde carbonyl group.

A highly regioselective, one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone is described.

Abstract
We disclose a highly regioselective, catalytic one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ). The high regioselectivity originates from a phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enolization, selectively affording the thermodynamically preferred enol, followed by the subsequent oxidation event. Our method provides reliable access to several &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.

         <title>Observing the Entry Events of a Titanium&#8208;Based Photoredox Catalytic Cycle in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence and ultrafast mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopies are combined to watch the decisive primary events of entry into a sustainable photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle utilizing an affordable, non&#8208;toxic, and highly efficient titanium(IV) photocatalyst.







Abstract
Titanium&#8208;based catalysis in single electron transfer (SET) steps has evolved into a versatile approach for the synthesis of fine chemicals and first attempts have recently been made to enhance its sustainability by merging it with photo&#8208;redox (PR) catalysis. Here, we explore the photochemical principles of all&#8208;Ti&#8208;based SET&#8208;PR&#8208;catalysis, i.e. in the absence of a precious metal PR&#8208;co&#8208;catalyst. By combining time&#8208;resolved emission with ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe (UV/MIR) spectroscopy on femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;microsecond time scales we quantify the dynamics of the critical events of entry into the catalytic cycle; namely, the singlet&#8208;triplet interconversion of the do&#8208;it&#8208;all titanocene(IV) PR&#8208;catalyst and its one&#8208;electron reduction by a sacrificial amine electron donor. The results highlight the importance of the PR&#8208;catalyst's singlet&#8208;triplet gap as a design guide for future improvements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions Enforce Conformation in Switchable and Water&#8208;Soluble Diketopiperazine&#8208;Pyridine Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a diketopiperazine&#8208;based foldamer design that maintains its conformation in challenging environments, making it a promising platform for future therapeutic applications. The conformation is enforced by juxtaposition of dipolar repulsion and torsional strain interactions. The foldamers show dynamic switching capabilities, responding to external stimuli and paving the way for new applications in mimicking biological systems.







Abstract
To reach their potential as mimics of the dynamic molecules present in biological systems, foldamers must be designed to display stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. Here we report such a foldamer architecture based on alternating pyridine&#8208;diketopiperazine linkers. Epimerization is conveniently prevented through a copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling protocol. The compounds&#8217; native unswitched conformation is first discovered in the solid and solution state. The foldamers can be solubilized in DMSO and pH&#8197;9.5 buffer, retaining conformational control to a large degree. Lastly, dynamic switching is demonstrated through treatment with acid, leading to behaviour we describe as stimulus&#8208;responsive sidechain reconfiguration.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of naphthalene&#8208;tethered allenynes gave 4H&#8208;cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) derivatives. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic reaction of an alkyne with the activated allene to generate a vinyl cation intermediate followed by arylation. Selective formation of CPP and dibenzofluorene derivatives using aryl&#8208;substituted substrates, depending on the reaction conditions, is also presented.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of naphthalene&#8208;tethered allenynes gave strained fused phenanthrene derivatives. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic reaction of an alkyne with the activated allene to generate a vinyl cation intermediate, followed by arylation with a tethered naphthalene ring to form the 4H&#8208;cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) scaffold. When using aryl&#8208;substituted substrates on the alkyne terminus, the gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction produced dibenzofluorene derivatives along with the CPP derivatives. Selective formation of CPP and dibenzofluorene derivatives depending on the reaction conditions is also presented.

         <title>Bonding and Acidity of the Formal Hydride in the Prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+ Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;bound hydrogen has been shown to improve chemical reactivity and selectivity in gold clusters. However, the chemical properties and reactivity of these hydrogen atoms is difficult to directly probe. We show for the prototypical cluster Au9(PPh3)8H2+ that the hydrogen bonds to the cluster in a manner somewhere between a covalent bond and a particle in a box, and that it is likely to behave as a moderate acid.







Abstract
The role of hydrogen atoms as surface ligands on metal nanoclusters is of profound importance but remains difficult to directly study. While hydrogen atoms often appear to be incorporated formally as hydrides, evidence suggests that they donate electrons to the cluster's delocalized superatomic orbitals and may consequently behave as acidic protons that play key roles in synthetic or catalytic mechanisms. Here we directly test this assertion for the prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+ nanocluster, formed by addition of a hydride to the well&#8208;characterized Au9(PPh3)83+. Using gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy, we were able to unambiguously isolate Au9(PPh3)8H2+ and Au9(PPh3)8D2+, revealing an Au&#8722;H stretching mode at 1528&#8197;cm&#8722;1 that shifts to 1038&#8197;cm&#8722;1 upon deuteration. This shift is greater than the maximum expected for a typical harmonic potential, suggesting a potential governing cluster&#8208;H bonding that has some square&#8208;well character consistent with the hydrogen nucleus behaving as a metal atom in the cluster core. Complexing this cluster with very weak bases reveals a redshift of 37&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the Au&#8722;H vibration, consistent with those typically seen for moderately acidic groups in gas phase molecules and providing an estimate of the acidity of Au9(PPh3)8H2+, at least with regard to its surface reactivity.

         <title>Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Localized CdS Homojunctions through Facet Control for Improved Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The d&#8208;band center of localized CdS homojunctions has been regulated by high and low index facet control for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates in water overall splitting reaction. Photoexcited electrons and holes are separately transferred to reductive (002) and oxidative (110) facets within localized field to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen (H2) and oxygen evolution at a solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 efficiency of 2.20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The accelerated kinetic behaviour of charge carrier transfer and its unhindered surface reaction dynamic process involving oxygenated&#8208;intermediate activation and conversion are urgently required in photocatalytic water (H2O) overall splitting, which has not been nevertheless resolved yet. Herein, localized CdS homojunctions with optimal collocation of high and low index facets to regulate d&#8208;band center for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates (*&#8208;OH and *&#8208;O) have been achieved in H2O overall splitting into hydrogen. Density functional theory, hall effect, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirm that, electrons and holes are kinetically transferred to reductive high index facet (002) and oxidative low index facet (110) of the localized CdS homojunction induced by facet Fermi level difference to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, along with a solar conversion into hydrogen (STH) of 2.20&#8201;% by Air Mass 1.5 Global filter irradiation. These findings contribute to solving the kinetic bottleneck issues of photocatalytic H2O splitting, which will further enhance STH.

         <title>Boosting Fe Cationic Vacancies with Graphdiyne to Enhance Exceptional Pseudocapacitive Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne as anode material in Li&#8208;ion batteries can realize effective charge transfer to induce the formation of a high number of Fe vacancies with uniform dispersion. The Fe vacancies modulate charge distribution, serve as active sites and enhance electron&#8208;ion transportation, thereby displaying robust pseudocapacitive behavior. The Fe vacancies also reduce the diffusion energy barrier and adsorption energies, leading to a superior battery performance.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of electrode materials at atomic level is the key to controlling electrodes with outstanding rate capability. On the basis of modulating the iron cationic vacancies (IV) and electronic structure of materials, we proposed the method of preparing graphdiyne/ferroferric oxide heterostructure (IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO) as anode materials. The goal is to motivate lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) toward ultra&#8208;high capacity, superior cyclic stability, and excellent rate performance. The graphdiyne is used as carriers to disperse Fe3O4 uniformly without agglomeration and induce high valence of Fe with reducing the energy in the system. The presence of Fe vacancy could regulate the charge distribution around vacancies and adjacent atoms, leading to facilitate electronic transportation, enlarge the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and decrease Li+ diffusion barriers, and thus displaying significant pseudocapacitive process and advantageous lithium&#8208;ion storage. The optimized electrode IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO reveals a capacity of 2084.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, superior cycle stability and rate performance with a high specific capacity of 1057.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;C.

         <title>Mechanochemical Mediated Coexistence of B&#8592;N Coordination and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexistence of hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination under mechanochemical conditions involving organoboron compounds is demonstrated. The mechanochemical conversion was monitored and reported by photoconversion of an alkene into a cyclobutane.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry afforded a photoactive cocrystal via coexisting (B)O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination. Specifically, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical ball mill grinding and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding of a boronic acid and an alkene resulted in mixtures of hydrogen&#8208;bonded and coordinated complexes akin to mixtures of noncovalent complexes that can be obtained in solution in equilibria processes. The alkenes of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assembly undergo an intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization in quantitative conversion, effectively reporting the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly processes. Our results suggest that interplay involving noncovalent bonds subjected to mechanochemical conditions can lead to functional solids where, in the current case, the structure composed of the weaker hydrogen bonding interactions predominates.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The association constants of triaryl boron&#8208; and triaryl phosphorus&#8208;derived Lewis pairs equipped with dispersion energy donors were determined at various temperatures. The extracted thermodynamic parameters were used to challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum mechanical methods and led to the development of an efficient workflow to calculate constants for weakly bound Lewis pairs.







Abstract
An isostructural series of boron/phosphorus Lewis pairs was systematically investigated. The association constants of the Lewis pairs were determined at variable temperatures, enabling the extraction of thermodynamic parameters. The stabilization of the Lewis adduct increased with increasing size of the dispersion energy donor groups, although the donor and acceptor properties of the Lewis pairs remained largely unchanged. This data was utilized to challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods, which finally led to an enhanced workflow for the determination of thermochemical properties of weakly bound Lewis pairs within an accuracy of 0.6 to 1.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for computed association free energies.

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Polymerization of a Side&#8208;Chain Transformable Bulky Acrylamide Monomer and Subsequent Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification for Syntheses of Isotactic Polyacrylate and Polyacrylamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pendant&#8208;transformable bulky acrylamide monomer was designed for the synthesis of a series of isotactic poly(alkyl acrylamide)s and poly(methyl acrylate). The stereospecific radical polymerization of the special monomer was controlled under diluted condition at lower temperature. The pendant underwent subsequent quantitative aminolysis and alcoholysis post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
We report syntheses of isotactic polyacrylate and polyacrylamide via a stereospecific radical polymerization of a pendant&#8208;transformable monomer, acrylamide carrying isopropyl&#8208;substituted ureidosulfonamide (1), followed by post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM). The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (2) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron&#8208;withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit 1 revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et3N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of 1 in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60&#8201;&#176;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et3N. Thus&#8208;obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [m=74&#8201;%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (m=51&#8201;%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually m was increased up to 93&#8201;%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso&#8208;specific radical polymerization of 1 gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).

         <title>Tetraazacoronenes and Their Dimers, Trimers and Tetramers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 35, August 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraazacoronenes were synthesized from bay&#8208;functionalized tetraazaperylenes by Zr&#8208;mediated cyclization and four&#8208;fold Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling. The latter not only gives the tetraazacoronene target compound but also the condensed azacoronene dimer and higher oligomers.







Abstract
Tetraazacoronenes were synthesized from bay&#8208;functionalized tetraazaperylenes by Zr&#8208;mediated cyclization and four&#8208;fold Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling. In the Zr&#8208;mediated approach, an &#951;4&#8208;cyclobutadiene&#8208;zirconium(IV) complex was isolated as an intermediate to cyclobutene&#8208;annulated derivatives. Using bis(pinacolatoboryl)vinyltrimethylsilane as a C2 building block gave the tetraazacoronene target compound along with the condensed azacoronene dimer as well as higher oligomers. The series of extended azacoronenes show highly resolved UV/Vis absorption bands with increased extinction coefficients for the extended aromatic cores and fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;% at 659&#8197;nm.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Site&#8208;Switchable Hydroarylation of Alkenes Controlled by Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;catalyzed remote site&#8208;switchable hydroarylation of alkenes was reported, delivering the products functionalized at the subterminal methylene and terminal methyl positions on an alkyl chain controlled by two different ligands, respectively, in good yields and with good to excellent site&#8208;selectivities. The catalytic system showed good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope, including unactivated and activated alkenes. More importantly, the regioconvergent transformations of mixtures of isomeric alkenes were also successfully realized. The results of the mechanistic studies demonstrate that the reaction undergoes a chain&#8208;walking process to give an [Ar&#8208;Ir&#8208;H] complex of terminal alkene. The subsequent processes proceed through the modified Chalk&#8722;Harrod&#8208;type mechanism via the migratory insertion of terminal alkene into the Ir&#8722;C bond followed by C&#8722;H reductive elimination to afford the hydrofunctionalization products site&#8208;selectively.</dc:description>

The catalytic system showed good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope, including unactivated and activated alkenes. More importantly, the regioconvergent transformations of mixtures of isomeric alkenes were also successfully realized. The results of the mechanistic studies demonstrate that the reaction undergoes a chain-walking process to give an [Ar-Ir-H] complex of terminal alkene. The subsequent processes proceed through the modified Chalk&#8722;Harrod-type mechanism via the migratory insertion of terminal alkene into the Ir&#8722;C bond followed by C&#8722;H reductive elimination to afford the hydrofunctionalization products site-selectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response in a Densely&#8208;Stacked Van Der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Oxychloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental optical property of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. Thus far, it has proved difficult to engineer large SHG responses, particularly in the mid&#8208;infrared region, owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the arrangement and density of functional NLO&#8208;active units. Herein, a new assembly strategy employing functional modules only, and aimed at maximizing the density and optimizing the spatial arrangement of highly efficient functional modules, has been applied to the preparation of NLO crystals, affording the van der Waals crystal MoO2Cl2. This exhibits the strongest powder SHG response (2.1 &#215; KTiOPO4 (KTP) @ 2100 nm) for a transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide, a wide optical transparency window, and a sufficient birefringence. MoO2Cl2 is the first SHG&#8208;active transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide effective in the IR. Theoretical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest that the densely packed, optimally&#8208;aligned [MoO4Cl2] modules within the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals layers are responsible for the giant SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of pentacene: a facile and versatile approach to contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) starting from the functionalized pentacene was established. A series of novel PAHs 1&#8208;4 were synthesized through a simple two&#8208;step synthesis protocol involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes 5&#8208;8 as a key step. All the molecules were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Interestingly, the most striking feature of 1&#8208;4 is their highly contorted carbon structures and the accompanying helical chirality. In particular, the optical resolution of 2 was successfully achieved by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC, and the enantiomers were characterized by CD and CPL spectroscopy. Despite the highly non&#8208;planar conformations, these contorted PAHs also exhibited intrinsically emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields, implying the potential utility of this series PAHs as possible high&#8208;quality organic laser dyes. Together with epoxy resin by a self&#8208;assembly method, a bottle microlaser based on 3a was successfully illustrated with a lasing wavelength of 567.8 nm at a threshold of 0.3 mJ/cm2. We believe that this work will shed light on the chemical versatility of pentacene and its derivatives in the construction of novel functionalized PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Well&#8208;Defined Fluoropolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoropolymer is important to meet diverse requirements in high&#8208;end applications. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, highlights recent developments toward controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain fluorinated copolymers and emerging explorations toward applications.







Abstract
In the past 80&#8197;years, fluoropolymers have found broad applications in both industrial and academic settings, owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks present an important avenue to obtain high&#8208;performance materials by merging intrinsic attributes of fluorocarbons and great versatility of comonomers. Recently, while massive investigations have disclosed the great potentials of precisely synthesized polymers, researchers have made considerable efforts to approach well&#8208;defined fluorinated copolymers. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations (CRCPs) of fluoroalkenes and provides a concise perspective on recent progress in CRCPs of fluoroalkenes (e.g., tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, hexafluoropropene, perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers) with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, which have enabled on&#8208;demand preparations of various main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with predefined molar masses, low dispersities, as well as regulable chemical compositions and sequences. The synthetic advantages of CRCPs will promote controlled and facile access to customized fluoropolymers for high&#8208;tech applications such as batteries, coatings and so on.

         <title>High Valence State Sites as Favorable Reductive Centers for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high valence state of Co3+ in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid catalyst can serve as the active site to drive a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction at high current densities. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for producing sustainable and clean hydrogen. Typically, high valence state sites are favorable for oxidation evolution reaction (OER), while low valence states can facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, here we proposed a high valence state of Co3+ in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid as the favorable center for efficient and stable HER, while structural analogues with low chemical states showed much worse performance. As a result, the Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx catalyst could drive alkaline HER with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 22&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 175&#8197;mV for 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the industrial temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, with an excellent stability over 300&#8197;h. Moreover, this material could work for both OER and HER, with a low cell voltage being 1.730&#8197;V to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting at 60&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) clearly identified the high valence Co3+ sites, while in situ XAS during HER and theoretical calculations revealed the favorable electron capture at Co3+ and suitable H adsorption/desorption energy around Co3+, which could accelerate the HER. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anhydrous room temperature CAS&#8208;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified with thirty small molecules and twelve alternating conjugated polymers. Mechanism studies revealed the importance of room temperature and anhydrous condition in reducing the homocoupling defects and enhancing the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers.







Abstract
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most important and powerful methods for constructing C&#8722;C bonds. However, the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids hinder the development of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling in the precise synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs). Here, an anhydrous room temperature Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified by thirty small molecules and twelve CPs. Meanwhile, the mechanistic studies involving with capturing four coordinated borate intermediate revealed the direct transmetalation of boronic esters in the absence of H2O suppressing the protodeboronation. Additionally, the room temperature reaction significantly reduced the homocoupling defects and enhanced the optoelectronic properties of the CPs. In all, this work provides a green protocol to synthesize alternating CPs.

         <title>Engineering Soluble Diketopyrrolopyrrole Chromophore Stacks from a Series of Pd(II)&#8208;Based Ravels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of one, two, three, or four diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes was achieved by employing recent progress in Pd(II)&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs have been identified: a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack. With increasing stack size, the absorption bathochromically shifts and emission quenches, except for Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional luminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy to engineer the stacking of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes based on non&#8208;statistical metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assembly is introduced. For this, the DPP backbone is equipped with nitrogen&#8208;based donors that allow for different discrete assemblies to be formed upon the addition of Pd(II), distinguished by the number of &#960;&#8208;stacked chromophores. A Pd3L6 three&#8208;ring, a heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8242;2 ravel composed of two crossing DPPs (flanked by two carbazoles), and two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs (a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack), were obtained and systematically investigated. With increasing counts of stacked chromophores, UV/Vis absorptions red&#8208;shift and emission intensities decrease, except for compound Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%. This is extraordinary for open&#8208;shell metal containing assemblies and explainable by an intra&#8208;assembly FRET process. The modular design and synthesis of soluble multi&#8208;chromophore building blocks offers the potential for the preparation of nanodevices and materials with applications in sensing, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optics.

         <title>Chemical Bonding Tuned Lattice Anharmonicity Leads to a High Thermoelectric Performance in Cubic AgSnSbTe3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of p&#8208;d and s&#8208;p antibonding states near the Fermi level as well as metavalent bonding provide an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a high electrical conductivity, resulting in a high thermoelectric performance of the cubic AgSnSbTe3 single crystal.







Abstract
Comprehension of chemical bonding and its intertwined relation with charge carriers and heat propagation through a crystal lattice is imperative to design compounds for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we report the synthesis of large single crystal of new p&#8208;type cubic AgSnSbTe3 which shows an innately ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.47&#8211;0.27&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;1 and a high electrical conductivity (1238 &#8211; 800&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the temperature range 294&#8211;723&#8197;K. We investigated the origin of the low &#954;lat by analysing the nature of the chemical bonding and its crystal structure. The interaction between Sn(5&#8197;s)/Ag(4d) and Te(5p) orbitals was found to generate antibonding states just below the Fermi level in the electronic band structure, resulting in a softening of the lattice in AgSnSbTe3. Furthermore, the compound exhibits metavalent bonding which provides highly polarizable bonds with a strong lattice anharmonicity while maintaining the superior electrical conductivity. The electronic band structure exhibits nearly degenerate valence&#8208;band maxima that help to achieve a high Seebeck coefficient throughout the measured temperature range and, as a result, the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit reaches to &#8776;1.2 at 661&#8197;K in pristine single crystal of AgSnSbTe3.

         <title>Annulation&#8208;Induced Hidden Reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triazoles are an important class of compounds with widespread applications and functionalization of triazole backbone is of significant interest. In comparison to 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, C&#8211;H activation&#8208;functionalization of the congeners 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is surprisingly underdeveloped. In fact, no such C&#8211;H activation&#8208;functionalization is ever reported for 4&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazole core. Furthermore, although denitrogenative (release of N2 via N&#8211;N bond cleavage) ring&#8208;opening of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is well&#8208;explored, 1,2,4&#8208;triazole/triazolium substrates have not been known so far for exhibiting N&#8211;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reactivity. In this work, we unveiled an unusual hidden reactivity of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone involving the elusive N&#8211;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This new reactivity was induced by a Satoh&#8208;Miura&#8208;type C&#8211;H activation&#8208;annulation at the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole motif appended with a pyridine directing group. This unique reaction allowed ready access of a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamines, with one pyridine&#8208;ring fully&#8208;substituted with alkyl groups. The unsymmetrical 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamines were utilized to access unsymmetrical boron&#8208;aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes. Empowered with desirable optical/physical properties e.g., large Stokes shift and suitable hydrophobicity arising from optimal alkyl chain length at the fully&#8208;substituted pyridine&#8208;ring, new unsymmetrical boron&#8208;aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene dyes were applied for intracellular selective lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;imaging studies, which provided useful information toward designing suitable lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;imaging probes for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;quenched Fluorophore Dimers for DNA&#8208;PAINT and STED Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for fluorophore&#8208;labelled DNA oligonucleotides is introduced that relies on short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching of two identical fluorophores. This strategy achieves a reduction in background fluorescence, while at the same time increasing the photon budget two&#8208;fold. These probes can be applied to super&#8208;resolution techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM).







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution techniques like single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy have been extended by the use of non&#8208;covalent, weak affinity&#8208;based transient labelling systems. DNA&#8208;based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi&#8208;target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2&#8208;fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore&#8208;dimer single&#8208;stranded DNA, and show super&#8208;resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.

DNA-based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi-target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore-labelled single-stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short-distance self-quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2-fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore-dimer single-stranded DNA, and show super-resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous reaction cycle for the Wittig reaction has been developed by synthesising a polymer with permanent porosity that incorporates the Wittig reagent. Therefore, the highly energy&#8208;intensive separation process needed in the homogeneous reaction pathway can be avoided. The material described could enable a continuous Wittig process[WVAW1]&#160; in industry.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin&#8197;A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as a solid Wittig reagent that undergoes, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed for regeneration of the solid Wittig reagent and reuse for the same reaction cycle. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl amines are of constant interest in organic synthesis owing to their ubiquity in natural products, pharmaceuticals and organic materials. However, C&#8208;H amination or pre&#8208;functionalization frequently results in uncontrollable site selectivity, over activation and the generation of inseparable mixtures of regio&#8208;isomers. Here we present a novel metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type aminobenzannulation reaction that circumvents the selectivity issues inherent in aromatic chemistry, as well as the use of stoichiometric unstable organolithium reagents and toxic chromium complexes. The concept of utilizing readily available isocyanides and Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates to achieve1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling to construct ketenimine is the key to success, which has been experimentally and computationally verified. The tandem 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/aromatization process offers a versatile method for synthesizing functionalized anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture of Singlet Oxygen Modulates Host&#8208;Guest Behavior of Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of anthracene&#8208;based tetrahedral capsules have been shown to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The cage cycloadducts were found to bind an array of guest molecules more weakly than their precursor cages, offering a novel method for stimuli&#8208;driven guest uptake and release.







Abstract
The anthracene panels of two tetrahedral MII4L6 cages, where MII=CoII or FeII, were found to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen (1O2) in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. ESI&#8208;MS analysis showed the cobalt(II) cages to undergo complete transformation of all anthracene panels into endoperoxides, whereas the iron(II) congeners underwent incomplete conversion. The reaction was found to be partially reversible in the case of the 1&#8208;FeII cage. The dioxygen&#8208;cage cycloadducts were found to bind a set of guest molecules more weakly than the parent cages, with affinity dropping by more than two orders of magnitude in some cases. The light&#8208;driven cycloaddition reaction between cage and 1O2 thus served as a stimulus for guest release and reuptake.

         <title>Combinatorial screening of water/proton permeation of self&#8208;assembled Pillar[5]arene artificial water channel libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial water channels&#8208;AWCs that selectively transport water rejecting ions through bilayer membranes have potential to act as synthetic Aquaporins (AQPs). AWCs can have a similar osmotic permeability, better stability, with simpler manufacture on a larger&#8208;scale and have higher functional density and surface permeability when inserted into the membrane. Here, we report the screening of combinatorial libraries of symmetrical and unsymmetrical rim functionalized PAs A&#8208;D, that are able to transport ~107&#8208;108 water molecules/s/channel, which is within 1 order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; and show total ion and proton rejection. Among four channels, C and D are 3&#8208;4 times more water permeable than A, B when inserted in bilayer membranes. The binary combinations of A&#8208;D with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear ABA), a recessive (inhibition AB, AC, DB, ACA) or a dominant (amplification, DBD) behavior of the water net permeation events.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimalist Design of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes: Tunable Geometry, Size, Chirality, and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross&#8208;sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h&#8208;motif structure incorporating double&#8208;crossover (DX) tile&#8208;like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self&#8208;assembly of H&#8208;NT units, thus producing programmable, micrometer&#8208;long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the H&#8208;NT nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist H&#8208;NTs can assemble at near&#8208;physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA&#8208;economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonic or other functional materials and as cost&#8208;efficient drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products by Hydrophobicity&#8208;Induced Electro&#8208;Kinetic Retardation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the performance of the Cu&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO2, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO2 by cation&#8208;exchange ionomers can enhance the C2+ product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C2+ selectivity, and thus the resulting C2+ FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro&#8208;kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group&#8208;functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro&#8208;kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C2+ Faradaic efficiencies of ~90% at a partial current density of 223 mA cm&#8208;2, more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>The S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Is Critical for Substrate Selectivity and Can Be Targeted with Covalent Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) is a well&#8208;characterized target for antiviral drug discovery. To date, most antiviral drug discovery efforts have focused on the S4&#8208;S1&#8217; pocket of Mpro; however, it is still unclear whether the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket per se can serve as a new site for drug discovery. In this study, the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket of Mpro was found to differentially recognize viral peptidyl substrates; for instance, S3&#8217; in Mpro strongly favors Phe or Trp, and S1&#8217; favors Ala. The peptidyl inhibitor D&#8208;4&#8208;77, which possesses an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead, was discovered to be a promising inhibitor of Mpro, with an IC50 of 0.95&#160;&#181;M and an antiviral EC50 of 0.49 &#181;M. The Mpro/inhibitor co&#8208;crystal structure confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitor to the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket and revealed a covalent mechanism. In addition, D&#8208;4&#8208;77 functions as an immune protectant and suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro&#8208;induced antagonism of the host NF&#8208;&#954;B innate immune response. These findings indicate that the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro is druggable, and moreover, inhibiting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro can simultaneously protect human innate immunity and inhibit virion assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonate Hydrogenated to Formate in the Aqueous Phase over Nickel/TiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to utilize captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals, thus reducing carbon emissions and creating a revenue return. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. We report a supported non&#8208;noble metal catalyst, Ni/TiO2, with great selectivity over 96% and excellent stability in catalyzing the conversion of carbonate into formate in aqueous solution. Ni0 and Ni2+ species are both observed in Ni/TiO2 catalysts, and the synergistic effect of these two Ni components leads to high activity and high selectivity of carbonate hydrogenation to formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;valent Metals in Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and for fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include, post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and by providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs, to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Decomposition of Perfluorocarbons for over 1000 Hours via Active Site Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrafluoromethane (CF4), the simplest perfluorocarbon (PFC), has the potential to exacerbate global warming. Catalytic hydrolysis is a viable method to degrade CF4, but fluorine poisoning severely restricts both the catalytic performance and catalyst lifetime. In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF4 decomposition at 600&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000 hours. 27Al and 71Ga magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (GaIV), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8211;OH. In&#8208;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8211;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration&#8208;like process. As a result, the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieved 100% CF4 decomposition keeping an ultra&#8208;long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long&#8208;term CF4 decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Screening Protocol for Exploring Loop Length Requirements for the Formation of a Three Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine+ Base&#8208;Paired i&#8208;Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA sequences containing at least four runs of repetitive cytosines can fold into tetra&#8208;helical structures called i&#8208;Motifs. The interest in these DNA secondary structures is increasing due to their therapeutical and technological applications. Still, limited knowledge of their folding requirements is currently available. We developed a novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step pipeline for the systematic screening of putative i&#8208;Motif forming model sequences. Focusing on structures comprising only three cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ base pairs, we investigated what are the minimal lengths of the loops required for formation of an intra&#8208;molecular i&#8208;Motif. Our data indicate that two and three nucleotides are required to connect the strands through the major and the minor grooves of the i&#8208;Motif, respectively. Additionally, they highlight an asymmetric behavior according to the distribution of the cytosines. Specifically, no sequence containing a single cytosine in the first and third run was able to fold into intra&#8208;molecular i&#8208;Motifs with the same stability of those formed when the first and the third run comprise two cytosines. This knowledge represents a step forward to the development of prediction tools for the proper identification of biologically functional i&#8208;Motif as well as for the rational design of these secondary structures as technological devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are expected for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early&#8208;stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8211;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8211;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into the Carbon&#8208;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed aryne insertion into heteroaryl C&#8722;I bonds to access valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls, characterized by high efficiency and selectivity, has first been realized. The newly discovered Lewis acid catalyzed insertion model opens up numerous opportunities for the further development of aryne chemistry.







Abstract
Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine bonds.

         <title>Bulk Passivation Enables Hundredfold&#8208;Enhanced Electroluminescence of Monophosphine Cu4I4 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode based on a monodentate&#8208;ligand&#8208;based Cu4I4 cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 104&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulky passivation effect of the active host matrix through non&#8208;covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions, which markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100&#8208;fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.







Abstract
Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large&#8208;scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand&#8208;based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu4I4 cube named [TMeOPP]4Cu4I4. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host&#8208;cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton&#8208;confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap&#8208;state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7&#8208;fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 104 nits, which is &#8776;100&#8208;fold that of the non&#8208;doped analogue.

         <title>Benzotriazole&#8208;Based 3D Four&#8208;Arm Small Molecules Enable 19.1&#8201;% Efficiency for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;Based Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
We synthesized three 3D four&#8208;arm small molecules with spirobifluorene as the central core and different end&#8208;group&#8208;modified benzotriazole units as arms. By incorporating four&#8208;arm molecules, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved improved efficiencies of 18.7&#8211;19.1&#8201;%, benefiting from triggered multiple mechanisms and the inhibited excessive aggregation of Y6. Our results open a new avenue for the design of promising guest molecules for ternary OSCs.







Abstract
A third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the preferred ingredient for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3D&#8208;structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three four&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials to the classical system PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1&#8201;%, 18.7&#8201;%, and 18.8&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE=17.4&#8201;%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using combinations of machine&#8208;learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high&#8208;entropy materials for catalyst discovery.







Abstract
Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the chemical synthesis of F2 has been elucidated by experimental and electronic structure theory methods. The elimination of F2 from MnF4 requires a large excess of SbF5 occurring in the last reaction step by addition of SbF5 to the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11]&#8722; anion producing F2 and crystalline Mn[Sb2F11]2.







Abstract
The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn atom thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.

         <title>Electroreductive Radical Borylation of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Without Light by Using Cumulene&#8208;Based Redox Mediators
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically promoted functionalization of unactivated chloroarenes without light is achieved by using novel tetraarylcumulene&#8208;based redox mediators.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) plays a critical role in many chemical processes, from organic synthesis to environmental remediation. However, the selective reduction of inert substrates (Ep/2&lt;&#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+), such as ubiquitous electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8211;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8211;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step&#8208;wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron&#8208;neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag1812+ Cluster with Excitation&#8208;Intensity&#8208;Dependent Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag1812+ cluster displays dual emission which can be used to create a ratiometric light intensity meter.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are easily tunable emitters with intriguing photophysical properties. Here, a DNA&#8208;AgNC with dual emission in the red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions is presented. Mass spectrometry data showed that two DNA strands stabilize 18 silver atoms with a nanocluster charge of 12+. Besides determining the composition and charge of DNA2[Ag18]12+, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved methods were applied to characterize the picosecond red fluorescence and the relatively intense microsecond&#8208;lived NIR luminescence. During this process, the luminescence&#8208;to&#8208;fluorescence ratio was found to be excitation&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent. This peculiar feature is very rare for molecular emitters and allows the use of DNA2[Ag18]12+ as a nanoscale excitation intensity probe. For this purpose, calibration curves were constructed using three different approaches based either on steady&#8208;state or time&#8208;resolved emission measurements. The results showed that processes like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or photon upconversion through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) could be excluded for DNA2[Ag18]12+. We, therefore, speculate that the ratiometric excitation intensity response could be the result of optically activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first flex&#8208;activated fluorogenic mechanophore (FA) is presented. Its retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction, resulting in the release of anthracenes with turn&#8208;on fluorescence, is achieved through compression of FA&#8208;crosslinked networks or hydrostatic high pressure applied to FA crystals and its polymers. The structural and functional diversity of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores as sensitive and unconventional optical force probes is enriched.







Abstract
Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High&#8208;resolution imaging with CO&#8208;modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208; oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.

Comparing the assembly of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom-up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic-level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three-dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D- and L-oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.







Abstract
The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.

         <title>Directing (110) Oriented Lithium Deposition through High&#8208;flux Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)&#8208;orientated Li substrate. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle are expanded in Li electrocrystallization process to decouple the relationship between SEI engineering and preferred crystal orientation. Multi&#8208;spectroscopic techniques combined with dynamics analysis reveal that the high&#8208;flux CF3Si(CH3)3 (F3) induced SEI (F3&#8208;SEI) with high LiF and &#8208;Si(CH3)3 contents can ingeniously accelerate Li+ transport dynamics and ensure the sufficient Li+ concentration below SEI to direct Li (110) orientation. The induced Li (110) can in turn further promote the surface migration of Li atoms to avoid tip aggregation, resulting in a planar, dendrite&#8208;free morphology of Li. As a result, our F3&#8208;SEI enables ultra&#8208;long stability of Li||Li symmetrical cells for more than 336 days. Furthermore, F3&#8208;SEI modified Li can significantly enhance the cycle life of Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM811 coin and pouch full cells in practical conditions. Our crystallographic strategy for Li dendrite suppression paves a path to achieve reliable LMBs and may provide guidance for the preferred orientation of other metal crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Comparisons between Directing and Alternating Current Electrolysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrosynthesis has consistently aroused significant interest within both academic and industrial spheres. Despite the considerable progress achieved in this field, the majority of electrochemical transformations have been conducted through the utilization of direct&#8208;current (DC) electricity. In contrast, the application of alternating current (AC), characterized by its polarity&#8208;alternating nature, remains in its infancy within the sphere of organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. This minireview offers an overview of recent advancements in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and seeks to elucidate the differences between DC and AC electrolytic methodologies by probing into their underlying physical principles. These differences encompass the ability of AC to preclude the deposition of metal catalysts, the precision in modulating oxidation and reduction intensities, and the mitigation of mass transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence via Integrated Top&#8208;Down and Bottom&#8208;Up Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum). Square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal&#8722;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL&#8208;active, with &#934; and |glum| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft&#8208;lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely&#8208;ordered, one&#8208;dimensional co&#8208;assemblies to achieve the metrics to &#934; of 0.32 and |glum| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL&#8208;active emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;Off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique water transport mechanism is investigated in the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UTSA&#8208;280. An incoming water molecule can replace a coordinated molecule, referred to as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. UTSA&#8208;280 has 1D channels but the knock&#8208;off transport enables water diffusion along the other two dimensions, mimicking a pseudo&#8208;3D mass transfer. As a result, the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane has a high diffusion selectivity of water over ethanol.







Abstract
Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a high water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8211;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8211;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8211;F bonds. As such, C&#8211;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advancements of defluorinative functionalization is discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8211;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8211;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Vesicles Enable Mechano&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels are intriguing biomimetic materials. Previous efforts to develop mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels have mostly relied on chemical modifications of the hydrogel structures. Here, we present a simple, generalizable strategy that confers mechano&#8208;responsive behavior on hydrogels. Our approach involves embedding hybrid vesicles, composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic block copolymers, within the hydrogel matrix to act as signal transducers. Under mechanical stress, these vesicles undergo deformation and rupture, releasing encapsulated compounds that can control the hydrogel network. To demonstrate this concept, we embedded vesicles containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, into a calcium&#8208;crosslinked alginate hydrogel. When compressed, the released EGTA sequesters calcium ions and degrades the hydrogel. This study provides a novel method for engineering mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels that may be useful in various biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoop Polymers based on Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalenes for Charge Storage in Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With their bent &#960;&#8208;systems, cyclic conjugation and inherent cavities, conjugated nanohoops are attractive for organic electronics applications. For ease of processing and morphological stability, an incorporation into polymers is desirable, but to date was hampered with few exceptions by synthetic difficulties. We herein present a unique strategy for the synthesis of conjugated nanohoop polymers using a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) as central connector. We demonstrate this versatility by synthesizing three electronically diverse copolymers with dithienyldiketo(pyrrolopyrrol), fluorene and carbazole comonomers, and report the first donor&#8208;acceptor nanohoop polymer. Optoelectronic investigations reveal the prevalence of cyclic or linear conjugation, depending on the comonomer unit, and ambipolar electrochemical properties through the antiaromatic character of the DBP units. As the first report on using conjugated nanohoops for charge storage as positive electrode materials, we show a significant improvement in battery performance in a nanohoop&#8208;containing polymer compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer. We believe this study will pave the way for the synthesis of a diverse range of nanohoop polymers and further stimulate their exploration for charge storage in batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Resolved Organic Whispering&#8208;Gallery&#8208;Mode Hetero&#8208;Microrings for High&#8208;Security Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.</dc:description>

Through precisely regulating the charge-transfer (CT) strength, full-color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high-quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero-microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero-emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Near&#8208;Neutral Electrolyte Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performance of electrocatalytic reactions depends on not only the composition and structure of the active sites, but also their local environment, including the surrounding electrolyte. In this work, we demonstrate that BF2(OH)2&#8208; anion is the key fluoroborate species formed in the mixed KBi/KF (KBi = potassium borate) electrolyte to enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH. Through a combination of electrokinetic and in&#8208;situ spectroscopic studies, we show that the mixed KBi/KF electrolyte promotes the OER via two pathways: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH during the proton&#8208;producing reaction with its high buffering capacity; and 2) activating the interfacial water via strong hydrogen bonds with F&#8208;containing species. With the KBi/KF electrolyte, electrodeposited Co(OH)2 is able to achieve 100 mA/cm2 at 1.74 V, which is among the highest reported activities with earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts at near neutral conditions. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging electrolyte&#8208;engineering for improving the electrochemical performance of the OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferricyanide Armed Anodes Enable Stable Water Oxidation in Saturated Saline Water at 2 A/cm2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct seawater electrolysis at high current density and low overpotential affords an effective strategy toward clean and renewable hydrogen fuel production. However, the severe corrosion of anode as a result of the saturation of Cl&#8208; upon continuous seawater feeding seriously hamper the electrolytic process. Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co2P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8208;2000 mA cm&#8208;2 over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO43&#8208; and Fe(CN)63&#8208; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&#8208; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&#8208; adsorption by nearly 5&#8208;fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of elevated de&#8208;solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co&#8208;solvent to reduce H2O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&#8722; into the electrolyte. An I&#8722; ion&#8208;rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS2@SS full cell cycles 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8722; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 1600&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon nanocage substrates for NO3&#8722;RR was designed. The tuning of P increases the electron density of the Fe center, which promotes the adsorption and proton transfer of nitrate ions and related intermediates on the surface of electrocatalyst, leading to the superior NO3&#8722;RR performance at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C) as a NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalyst. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8722;RR process. The Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C catalyst exhibits 90.3&#8201;% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8722;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the critical role of atomic&#8208;level precision modulation by heteroatom doping for the NO3&#8722;RR, providing an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.







Abstract
Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3&#8201;Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3&#8201;Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.

     alt="When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrocene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe-center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;Fe&lt;/b&gt; and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;Fe&lt;/b&gt; can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li-carbenoid &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; that also displays unique reactivity. When &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; but with the added twist that the Li-carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li-carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li-carbenoid &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li-carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective formation of isoquinoline heterocycles by a PIII/PV=O redox organocatalyzed Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction is described. With N2 release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, the method permits the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomeric isoquinolines under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. and 93&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of isoquinoline heterocycles thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provides access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrahigh S&#8208;content additive, methylene methyl disulfonate, is preferentially oxidized via the strong interaction with PF6&#8722; anions, which forms the sulfur&#8208;rich interphase and broadens the oxidation stability of electrolyte. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cells.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an additive with ultrahigh S&#8208;content (34.04&#8201;%, methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8722; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, facilitating the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6&#8197;V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99&#8201;% even after 800&#8197;cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible coordination networks exhibit crossover sorption with change in affinity and uptake capacity on varying the temperature. The coordination networks show reverse affinity and uptake capacity for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4. This phenomenon was verified by both sorption isotherm and isobar measurements at different temperature ranges. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations were used to elucidate the mechanisms.







Abstract
Porous sorbents are materials that are used for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, in this study, we report a rare example of &#8220;crossover sorption,&#8221; in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs), [Zn2(L1)(L2)2]n (PCP&#8208;1) and [Zn2(L1)(L3)2]n (PCP&#8208;2) (L1= 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, L2=5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene, and L3=5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4, in which the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis to reveal the guest inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 for C2H2, CO2, C2H6, and C2H4 gases at various temperatures. Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (sc&#8208;sc) transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest binding positions, nature of host&#8211;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions, and their phase transformations upon exposure to these gases. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Driven, Switchable Catalysis Based on Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent regulatory systems of enzymes are widely used to modulate biological enzyme activities. Inspired by the regulation of reactive&#8208;site phosphorylation in organisms, we developed peptide&#8208;based catecholase mimetics with switchable catalytic activity and high selectivity through the co&#8208;assembly of nanofibers comprising peptides and copper ions (Cu2+). Through careful design and modification of the peptide backbone structure based on the change in the free energy of the system, we identified the peptide with the most effective reversible catalytic activity. Kinase/phosphatase switches were used to control the reversible transition of nanofiber formation and depolymerization, as well as to modulate the active&#8208;site microenvironment. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes of nanofibers were simulated using coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed the coordination of the peptide and Cu2+, forming a zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure at the catalytically active center of the nanofibers. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. This study opens novel avenues for designing biomimetic enzymes with ordered structures and dynamic catalytic activities.</dc:description>

Inspired by the regulation of reactive-site phosphorylation in organisms, we developed peptide-based catecholase mimetics with switchable catalytic activity and high selectivity through the co-assembly of nanofibers comprising peptides and copper ions (Cu2+). Through careful design and modification of the peptide backbone structure based on the change in the free energy of the system, we identified the peptide with the most effective reversible catalytic activity. Kinase/phosphatase switches were used to control the reversible transition of nanofiber formation and depolymerization, as well as to modulate the active-site microenvironment. Notably, the self-assembly and disassembly processes of nanofibers were simulated using coarse-grained molecular dynamics. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed the coordination of the peptide and Cu2+, forming a zipper-like four-ligand structure at the catalytically active center of the nanofibers. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. This study opens novel avenues for designing biomimetic enzymes with ordered structures and dynamic catalytic activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type ESIPT Chromophores with Distinctive Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;based solid luminescent materials with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) remain unexplored. Herein, we introduced a family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H&#8208;bonds with imines in imine&#8208;modified 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone&#8208;modified HBT chromophores. Imine&#8208;derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone&#8208;derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a concise and divergent synthesis of the complex hasubanan alkaloids metaphanine and oxoepistephamiersine from commercially available and inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal. Our synthesis features a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization reaction to set the tricyclic carbon framework of the desired molecules, a regioselective Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation followed by a MeNH2 triggered skeletal reorganization cascade to construct the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and a strategically late&#8208;stage regio&#8208;/diastereoselective oxidative annulation of sp3 C&#8208;H bond to form the challenging THF ring system and hemiketal moiety in a single step.

         <title>Enhanced Active Sites and Stability in Nano&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical Energy Storage through Dual Regulation by Tannic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited active sites and poor acid&#8208;alkaline solution stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), significantly limit their wider application. In this study, the acid property of tannic acid (TA) was used as an etchant to etch the surface&#8208;active sites. Subsequently, the further chelation of the protonated TA with the exposed metal active site can effectively protect the metal ions. Meanwhile, the TA provided a large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can greatly improve the stability of imidazolate&#8208;coordinated MOFs. The electrochemical test results indicated that the MOFs composite materials synthesized using this scheme had high specific capacitance and stability. And the mechanism of its electrochemical reaction process was explored through in&#8208;situ XRD and theoretical calculations. In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl&#8208;coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano&#8208;MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure elucidation of the first sex&#8208;inducing pheromone of a diatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for ~ 20% of global photosynthetic CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone&#8208;mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom Seminavis robusta, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex&#8208;inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an S. robusta SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MSn analyses, and chemical transformations. Essential was the use of negative ion mode MS to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of a High&#8208;Spin Aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulenes are open&#8208;shell triangular graphene flakes with
total spin increasing with their size. In the last years, onsurface&#8208;
synthesis strategies have permitted fabricating and
engineering triangulenes of various sizes and structures with
atomic precision. However, direct proof of the increasing total
spin with their size remains elusive. In this work, we report
the combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis of a
large nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene) and
the detection of its high spin ground state on a Au(111)
surface. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images
uncovered radical states distributed along the zigzag
edges, which were detected as weak zero&#8208;bias resonances in
scanning tunneling spectra. These spectral features reveal
the partial Kondo screening of a high spin state. Through
a combination of several simulation tools, we find that the
observed distribution of radical states is explained by a quintet
ground state (S = 2), instead of the expected quartet
state (S = 3/2), confirming the positively charged state of
the molecule on the surface.We further provide a qualitative
description of the change of (anti)aromaticity introduced by
N&#8208;substitution, and its role in the charge stabilization on a
surface, resulting in a S = 2 aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene on Au(111).</dc:description>

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Peptide Dimers Bind and Stabilize Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;stranded RNAs (dsRNA) possess immense potential for biomedical applications. However, their therapeutic utility is limited by low stability and poor cellular uptake. Different strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of dsRNA, including the incorporation of modified nucleotides, and the use of diverse carrier systems. Nevertheless, these have not resulted in a broadly applicable approach thereby preventing the wide&#8208;spread application of dsRNA for therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report the design of dimeric stapled peptides based on the RNA&#8208;binding protein TAV2b. These dimers are obtained via disulfide formation and mimic the natural TAV2b assembly. They bind and stabilize dsRNA in the presence of serum, protecting it from degradation. In addition, peptide binding also promotes cellular uptake of dsRNA. Importantly, peptide dimers monomerize under reducing conditions which results in a loss of RNA binding. These findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;based RNA binders for the stabilization and protection of dsRNA, representing an appealing strategy towards the environment&#8208;triggered release of RNA. This can broaden the applicability of dsRNA, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>
