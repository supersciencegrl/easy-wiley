      <title>Fluorescence Quenching Effects of Tetrazines and Their Diels&#8208;Alder Products: Mechanistic Insight Toward Fluorogenic Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iedDA) reactions between  s  &#8208;tetrazines and strained dienophiles have numerous applications in chemical biology and materials science. Tetrazines most often quench the emission of pendant fluorophores. This effect, however, is diminished upon iedDA, leading to the formation of emissive products with important applications in fluorescence labelling of biomolecules. Herein we investigate the effect of the dienophile on the fluorescence enhancement obtained upon reaction with a tetrazine&#8208;quenched fluorophore and study the possible mechanisms of fluorescence quenching by both the tetrazine and its reaction products through a combination of linear and ultrabroadband two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) experiments. The dihydropyridazine product obtained from reaction of the tetrazine with a strained cyclooctene shows a residual fluorescence quenching effect, greater than that exerted by the pyridazine arising from reaction of the tetrazine with the analogous alkyne. Ultrabroadband 2D ES measurements reveal that resonance energy transfer is the mechanism responsible for the fluorescence quenching effect of tetrazines, whereas a mechanism involving more intimate electronic coupling, most likely photoinduced electron transfer, is responsible for the quenching effect of the dihydropyridazine. These studies uncover parameters that can be tuned to maximize fluorogenic efficiency in bioconjugation reactions and they reveal that strained alkenes, though optimal for fast kinetics, are not the best reaction partners for achieving maximum contrast ratio in fluorescence labeling.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Promoted Cascade Rearrangement Involving the Enlargement of Two Rings: Efficient Access to Polycyclic Quinoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient cascade reaction of tryptamine&#8208;derived isocyanides with C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines is described. The polycyclic pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;  c  ]quinoline derivatives, which benefited from rearrangement process driven by hydrogen bonding, could be directly assembled in moderate to good yields (40&#8208;87%) under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. This transformation involved four new heterocyclic rings formations and uniquely, ring opening of indole as well as ring expansion of C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imine. Both experimental and DFT studies provided guidance on the in&#8208;depth insight into the reaction pathways and hydrogen bonding was identified to lower the free energy barrier in transition states. This work constitutes a rare example of tryptamine&#8208;derived isocyanide&#8208;based cascade reactions, and potentially could be a powerful synthetic strategy for accessing polycyclic analogues involved in natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D Dimensional Reduction for Exploiting Multilayered Perovskite Ferroelectric&#160;toward&#160;Polarized&#8208;Light&#160;Detection&#160;in Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Region</title>
      <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications, whereas new 2D candidates targeted at solar&#8208;blind UV range remain extremely scarce. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics that combine polarization and semiconducting properties have taken a booming position within this portfolio. Here, using the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D dimensional reduction of CH3NH3PbCl3, we successfully designed a multilayered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (CH3CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Cl10  , which shows notable spontaneous polarization and a high Curie temperature (390 K) comparable with that of BaTiO3  (393 K). Strikingly, the wide bandgap (~3.35 eV) and anisotropic absorbance stemming from its intrinsic 2D motif, greatly favor its polarization&#8208;sensitive activity in UV region. Consequently, the device displays excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive behaviours under 266 nm, along with a large dichroic ratio (~1.38) and high on/off current ratio (~2.3*103  ). This study sheds light on the further exploration of 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics toward new optoelectronic device application.</dc:description>

      <title>Dihydrogen Adduct (Co&#8208;H2) Complexes Displaying H&#8208;atom and Hydride Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>The prototypical reactivity profiles of transition metal dihydrogen complexes (M&#8208;H2) are well&#8208;characterized with respect to oxidative addition (to afford dihydrides, M(H)2) and as acids, heterolytically delivering H+ to a base and H&#8208; to the metal.

To this end, we describe herein the reactivity of an isostructural pair of a neutral S = &#189; and an anionic S = 0 Co&#8208;H2 adduct, both supported by a trisphosphine borane ligand (P3B). The thermally stable metalloradical, (P3B)Co(H2), serves as a competent precursor for hydrogen atom transfer to tBu3ArO&#183;. What is more, its anionic derivative, the dihydrogen complex [(P3B)Co(H&#173;2)]1&#8208;, is a competent precursor for hydride transfer to BEt3, establishing its remarkable hydricity.

      <title>Protein allostery at atomic resolution</title>
      <dc:description>Protein allostery is a phenomenon involving the long range coupling between two distal sites in a protein. In order to elucidate allostery at atomic resoluion on the ligand&#8208;binding WW domain of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;enzyme Pin1 multistate structures were calculated from exact nuclear Overhauser effect (eNOE). In its free form the protein undergoes a micro&#8208;second exchange between two states, one of which is predisposed to interact with its parent catalytic domain. In presence of the positive allosteric ligand, the equilibrium between the two states is shifted towards domain&#8208;domain interaction, suggesting a population shift model. In contrast, the allostery&#8208;suppressing ligand decouples the side&#8208;chain arrangement at the inter&#8208;domain interface thereby reducing the inter&#8208;domain interaction. As such, this mechanism is an example of dynamic allostery. The presented distinct modes of action highlight the power of the dynamics&#8208;function interplay in the biological activity of proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>A Genetically Encoded RNA Photosensitizer for Targeted Cell Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Genetically encoded RNA devices have emerged for various cellular applications in imaging and bio&#8208;sensing, but their functions as precise regulators in living systems are still limited. Inspired by protein photosensitizers, we propose here a  G  enetically encoded  R  NA  A  ptamer&#8208;based  P  hotosensitizer (GRAP). Upon illumination, the RNA photosensitizer can controllably generate reactive oxygen species for targeted cell regulation. The GRAP system can be selectively activated by endogenous stimuli and light of different wavelengths. Compared with their protein analogs, GRAP is highly programmable and exhibit reduced off&#8208;target effect. Our results indicate that GRAP enables efficient noninvasive target cell ablation with high temporal and spatial precision. We believe this new RNA regulator system will be widely used for optogenetics, targeted cell ablation, subcellular manipulation, and advanced imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photo&#8208;Switched MicroRNA Amplifier for Precise Photodynamic Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a hot topic in precise medicine. However the low abundance of responsive trigger molecules in early&#8208;stage diseases limits its application. Here we designed an amplifier with multiple upconversion luminances to achieve near&#8208;infrared photo&#8208;switched cascade reaction triggered by specific microRNA and precise PDT of early&#8208;stage cancers. This amplifier was composed of photo&#8208;caged DNA nanocombs and an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) sensitized with IRDye&#174; 800CW. The nanocomb was prepared by assembling a &#8220;photozipper&#8221;&#8208;protected hairpin and two kinds of hybridizable hairpin probes on a DNA skeleton. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, the produced UV light cleaved off the &#8220;photozipper&#8221; to induce microRNA&#8208;responsive cascade hybridization reaction, which activated the photosensitizers linked to different hairpins to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the simultaneously emitted blue light for efficient PDT. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the high amplification efficiency and promising application of the photo&#8208;switched amplifier in early&#8208;stage cancer treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Cocrystal prediction by artificial neural networks</title>
      <dc:description>A significant amount of attention has been given to the design and synthesis of cocrystals by both industry and academia because of its potential to change a molecule&#8217;s physicochemical properties. Yet, difficulties arise when searching for adequate combinations of molecules (or coformers) to form cocrystals, hampering the efficient exploration of the target&#8217;s solid&#8208;state landscape. This paper reports on the application of a data&#8208;driven cocrystal prediction method, based on two types of artificial neural network models and cocrystal data present in the Cambridge Structural Database. The models accept pairs of coformers and predict whether a cocrystal is likely to form. By combining the output of multiple models of both types, our approach shows to have excellent performance on the proposed cocrystal training and validation sets, and has an estimated accuracy of 80% for molecules for which previous cocrystallization data is unavailable.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Corona Structure on Gold Nanoclusters for Gastrointestinal Imaging by Red&#8208;shifted Emissions in the Second Near&#8208;infrared Window</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescence emissions in the second near infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have shown extraordinary advantages for bio&#8208;imaging. However, it&#8217;s a big challenge to exploit NIR&#8208;II emitters for gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging due to fluorescence quenching in digestive microenvironment. Herein, we made an interesting finding that red&#8208;shifted emissions of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) into NIR&#8208;II region with improved quantum yields (QY) could be achieved by engineering a corona structure of a ribonuclease&#8208;A (RNase&#8208;A) on particle surfaces. RNase&#8208;A encapsulated AuNCs (RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs) displayed emissions at 1050 nm with a 1.9% QY. Compare to rare earth and silver based NIR&#8208;II emitters, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs had excellent biocompatibility, showed &gt;50&#8208;fold higher sensitivity in GI tract, and homogeneously migrated during gastrointestinal peristalsis to allow visualization of the detailed structures of GI tract. Notably, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs could be exploited to successfully differentiate intestinal tumor mice from the healthy, indicating a potential utility for early diagnosis of intestinal tumors in clinics.</dc:description>

      <title>Versatile Nickel (II) Scaffolds as Coordination&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switches for 19F Magnetic Resonance&#8208;Based Detection</title>
      <dc:description>19  F magnetic resonance&#8208;based detection coupled with well&#8208;designed inorganic systems shows great promise in biological investigations including metabolic tracking, studies of protein structure and function, molecular imaging, and medical diagnostics, providing low biological background and high specificity of the modality. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept inorganic probes are reported that exploit a novel mechanism for  19  F MR sensing based on converting from low&#8208;spin (S=0) to high&#8208;spin (S=1) Ni  2+  . Activation of diamagnetic  NiL  1  and  NiL  2  via light or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase respectively converts them into paramagnetic  NiL  0  that displays a single  19  F NMR peak shifted by &gt;35 ppm with accelerated relaxation rates. This large chemical shift change is facilitated by contact and pseudo&#8208;contact interactions between the  19  F reporter and the 5&#8208;coordinate Ni  2+  . This spin&#8208;state switch is effective for sensing light or enzyme expression in live cells using  19  F MR spectroscopy and imaging that differentiate signals based on chemical shift and relaxation times. This general inorganic scaffold has potential for developing agents that can sense analytes ranging from ions to enzymes, opening up diverse possibilities for  19  F MR&#8208;based biosensing.</dc:description>

This large chemical shift change is facilitated by contact and pseudo&#8208;contact interactions between the  19  F reporter and the 5&#8208;coordinate Ni  2+  . This spin&#8208;state switch is effective for sensing light or enzyme expression in live cells using  19  F MR spectroscopy and imaging that differentiate signals based on chemical shift and relaxation times. This general inorganic scaffold has potential for developing agents that can sense analytes ranging from ions to enzymes, opening up diverse possibilities for  19  F MR&#8208;based biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Nitrogen Fixation Catalyzed by Stable Radical&#8208;Containing MOFs: Improved Efficiency Induced by a Structural Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we present a new viologen&#8208;based radical&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (RMOF) Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7, which upon heating in air undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to generate Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8. Both RMOFs exhibit excellent air and water stability as a result of favorable radical&#8208;radical interactions, and their long&#8208;lifetime radicals result in wide spectral absorption in the range 200&#8208;2500 nm. Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7 and Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8 show excellent activity toward solar&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation, with ammonia production rates of 128 and 220 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , respectively. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that both RMOFs have similar nitrogen fixation pathways. The enhanced catalytic efficiency of Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8 versus Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7 is attributed to intermediates stabilized by enhanced hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Surfactant&#8208;directed functionalization could serve as a promising tool for enabling targeted modification of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials and open up a whole new spectrum of exciting chemistry to be explored, as demonstrated by H. Bayley et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202005729). Shining light on the heterogenous reaction of chloroauric acid at the nanosheet&#8211;solution interface reveals that the employed surfactant plays a significant role in governing the reactivity of the nanomaterial and consequently on the functionalization outcome.

Bayley et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200572910.1002/anie.202005729&lt;/a&gt;). Shining light on the heterogenous reaction of chloroauric acid at the nanosheet&#8211;solution interface reveals that the employed surfactant plays a significant role in governing the reactivity of the nanomaterial and consequently on the functionalization outcome.

      <dc:description>The design, synthesis, and characterization of two novel nonfullerene acceptors (M8 and M34) based on ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacenes with different heterocycles are reported. Replacing the furan heterocycles with the thiophene heterocycles in the heteroheptacene backbone leads to hypsochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport for the resulting nonfullerene acceptor (M34) although the &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking distances are barely affected. Bulk&#8208;heterojunction polymer solar cells fabricated from M34 and a wide bandgap polymer (PM6) as the donor showed a best power conversion ef&#64257;ciency (PCE) of 15.24% with an open circuit voltage (  V  OC  ) of 0.91 V, much higher than a PCE of 4.21% and a  V  OC  of 0.83 V for the counterparts based on M8:PM6. These results highlight the importance of key atoms in the construction of high&#8208;performance nonfullerene acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Activating Versatile&#160;Mechanoluminescence in Organic Host&#8208;Guest Crystals by Controlling Exciton Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials are attracting increasing interest due to its promising applications in various areas. However, to date, it remains a major challenge to develop a precise and universal route to achieving organic ML materials. Herein, we report the first example that ML can be easily realized in organic piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals, under the conditions that neither the host nor the guest is ML&#8208;active. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that, excitons of the host generated by piezoelectricity can be harvested effectively by the guest for light emission, due to the restraint of intersystem crossing process. Moreover, different host&#8208;guest crystals are constructed, wherein the emission colour, intensity, colour purity and emission duration of ML can be manipulated. This work deepens our understanding of organic ML generation in piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals and provides an inspiring principle to design more organic ML materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing the Magnesium Storage Mechanism in Mesoporous Bismuth via Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Bismuth is a promising alternative to magnesium metal anode.

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Installation of Ln4(OH)4 Cubanes in an Anionic Metallosupramolecular Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
Soaking crystals of K6[Rh4Zn4O(l&#8208;cysteinate)12] in a lanthanide acetate solution results in the complete exchange of K+ with Ln3+ in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal process. For late lanthanides (Ln=Gd&#8211;Lu), this process afforded a series of lanthanide cubane clusters with a [Lu4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4]8+ core, which connect the RhIII4ZnII4 complex anions in a 3D MOF structure, showing magnetic cooling and heterogeneous catalytic abilities.







Abstract
Postsynthetic installation of lanthanide cubanes into a metallosupramolecular framework via a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation is presented. Soaking single crystals of K6[Rh4Zn4O(l&#8208;cys)12] (K6[1]; l&#8208;H2cys=l&#8208;cysteine) in a water/ethanol solution containing Ln(OAc)3 (Ln3+=lanthanide ion) results in the exchange of K+ by Ln3+ with retention of the single crystallinity, producing Ln2[1] (2Ln) and Ln0.33[Ln4(OH)4(OAc)3(H2O)7][1] (3Ln) for early and late lanthanides, respectively. While the Ln3+ ions in 2Ln exist as disordered aqua species, those in 3Ln form ordered hydroxide&#8208;bridged cubane clusters that connect [1]6&#8722; anions in a 3D metal&#8208;organic framework through coordination bonds with carboxylate groups. This study shows the utility of an anionic metallosupramolecular framework with carboxylate groups for the creation of a series of metal cubanes that have great potential for various applications, such as magnetic materials and heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles: An Emerging Versatile Platform for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificially synthesized affinity materials with tailor&#8208;made binding cavities complementary to the template molecules in shape, size and functionality. Recently, engineering MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines to improve cancer therapy has become a rapidly growing field and future research direction. Because of the unique properties and functions of MIPs, MIP&#8208;based nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) are not only alternative to current nanomaterials for cancer therapy, but also hold the potential to fill some gaps associated with biological ligand&#8208;based nanomedicines, such as immunogenicity, stability, applicability and economic rationality. In this mini&#8208;review, we survey recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanoMIPs for cancer therapy, and highlight their distinct features. In addition, using the features of MIPs to rationally design and construct cancer nanomedicines with desired performance, including extended circulation, active targeting, controlled drug release and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy are summarized and discussed. It is expected that this mini&#8208;review will inspire more advanced studies in MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Density and Thermally Stable Palladium Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Chemoselective Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have shown superior activity and/or selectivity for many energy&#8208; and environment&#8208;related reactions, but their stability at high site density and under reducing atmosphere remains unresolved. Herein, we elucidate the intrinsic driving force of palladium single atom with high site density (up to 5 wt%) under reducing atmosphere, and its unique catalytic performance for hydrogenation reactions.  In&#8208;situ  experiments (including scanning transmission electron microscopy, near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and quasi in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray adsorption) and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms tend to migrate into the surface vacancy&#8208;enriched molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process by transferring oxide crystals to carbide crystals, leading to the surface enrichment of atomic Pd instead of formation of particles. The Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent selectivity for both liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics (&gt; 99%) and gas&#8208;phase hydrogenation of CO  2  to CO (&gt; 98%), which is far superior to their nanoparticles analogues. More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of a Cryptic Depsipeptide from Streptomyces ghanaensis via MALDI&#8208;MS&#8208;Guided High&#8208;Throughput Elicitor Screening</title>
      <dc:description>Microbial genomes harbor an abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters, but most are expressed at low levels and need to be activated for characterization of their cognate natural products. In this work, we report the combination of high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) for the rapid identification of cryptic peptide natural products.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microbial genomes harbor an abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters, but most are expressed at low levels and need to be activated for characterization of their cognate natural products. In this work, we report the combination of high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) for the rapid identification of cryptic peptide natural products. Application to  Streptomyces ghanaensis  identified amygdalin as an elicitor of a novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, which we term cinnapeptin. Complete structural elucidation revealed cinnapeptin as a cyclic depsipeptide with an unusual 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;cinnamoyl group.

      <title>Probe&#8208;Free Direct Identification of Type I and Type II Photosensitized Oxidation Using Field&#8208;Induced Droplet Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>While Type I and Type II photosensitizers are often carefully tailored to achieve their respective advantages in treating different cancers, the identifications of the Type I and II mechanisms  per se  , the key reaction intermediates, and the consequent oxidation products of the substrates have never been easy. Using our unique home&#8208;built field&#8208;induced droplet ionization mass spectrometry (FIDI&#8208;MS) methodology that selectively samples molecules at the air&#8208;water interface,here we show the facile determination of both Type I and II mechanisms of a poster&#8208;child photosensitizer, temoporfin, without the addition of any probes. Remarkably, the unstable doublet radical resulting from the hydrogen abstraction by the triplet temoporfin through the Type I mechanism is captured, manifesting the  in&#8208;situ  advantage of FIDI&#8208;MS.

      <dc:description>The ability to incorporate functional metal ions (M  n+  ) into metal&#8208;organic coordination complexes adds remarkable flexibility in the synthesis of multifunctional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with tailorable electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.

      <title>LaOCl&#8208;coupled polymeric carbon nitride for overall water splitting through a  one&#8208;photon excitation pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Sun&#8208;light driven water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases in a large scale is a promising method for solar energy conversion. However, it is still a challenge to explore photocatalytic materials for overall water splitting due to the limited choice of a single semiconductor with suitable band energy levels (matching with water redox splitting potentials) while with minimized band gap for light harvesting. Here, we report a one&#8208;photon excitation pathway by coupling polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with LaOCl semiconductor to achieve overall water splitting. This artificial photosynthesis composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2, with evolution rates of 22.3 and 10.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1, respectively, outperforming most of the PCN&#8208;based materials. The high photocatalytic performance of PCN/LaOCl can be ascribed to the simultaneously accomplished reduction and oxidation of water on LaOCl and PCN domains, respectively, as well as the fast charge separation and migration induced by the interfacial electric field related to LaOCl modification. This study provides new insights on the development &#160;of composite photocatalysts for pure water splitting on the basis of polymer&#8208;based materials via charge modulation.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Spectral and Photochemical Properties of Bio&#8208;inspired Retinal Mimics via in Silico Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the spectral tunability and isomerization activity is currently one of the hot topics in the design of photo&#8208;reversible molecular switches for application in optoelectronic devices. The present work demonstrates how to manipulate the absorption of the retinal protonated Schiff base (rPSB) chromophore over the entire visible range by targeted functionalization of the retinal backbone. Moreover, we establish a correlation between the vertical excitation energy and the profile of the potential energy surface of the bright excited state responsible for the photoreactivity of rPSB. We exploited this correlation to rank the functionalized rPSB into different classes with characteristic photoisomerization activity. Eventually, the synergic effects of functionalization and of external electric fields in the few MV/cm range have been applied to achieve a reversable and regioselective control of the photoisomerization propensity of selected rPBS derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Posttranslational arginases provide a ribosomal route to non&#8208;proteinogenic ornithine residues in diverse peptide sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Ornithine is a component of many bioactive nonribosomal peptides but has been challenging to incorporate into ribosomal products. We recently identified OspR, a cyanobacterial arginase&#8208;like enzyme that installs ornithines in the antiviral ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) landornamide A. Here we report that OspR belongs to a larger family of peptide arginases from diverse organisms and RiPP types. In  E.&#160;coli  expressions, seven selected enzymes converted arginine residues to ornithines with little preference for the leader type. A diverse range of peptide sequences was modified, including polyarginine repeats. Further exploring the synthetic potential of OspR, we generated analogues of ornithine&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides using RiPP technology. Five pseudo&#8208;nonribosomal products with ornithines at correct positions were obtained. This included a brevicidine analogue containing ornithine and a d&#8208;amino acid that was installed by the peptide epimerase OspD, suggesting new opportunities for peptide bioengineering.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiospecific solid solution formation triggers the propagation of homochirality</title>
      <dc:description>Propagation of homochirality plays a crucial role in the discussion on the origin of life. We here investigate the role of structurally related enantiopure additives in chiral symmetry breaking during reactive crystallizations. We demonstrate that a symmetry breaking process can be driven towards the same absolute configuration as the additive if this additive forms an enantiospecific solid solution with the racemate. We observe two antagonistic processes: enantiospecific growth inhibition directs symmetry breaking to the opposite enantiomer following &#8220;the rule of reversal&#8221; and enantiospecific solid solution formation that favors homochiral outcomes. During continuous grinding, contributions of solid solution formation override contributions of enantiospecific growth inhibition, directing the process towards the absolute configuration of the additive. Collectively, our findings offer a potential mechanism for propagation of homochirality.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Mono&#8208;coordinated silicon(II) cations are predicted to be reactive ambiphiles, combining the typically high Lewis acidity of silicon cations with nucleophilicity due to the presence of an electron pair at the same atomic centre. Here, a carbazole&#8208;derived scaffold was used to isolate salts with a mono&#8208;coordinated silicon(II) cation, [RSi]+ (R = bulky carbazolyl substituent), by halide abstraction from a base&#8208;free halosilylene, RSiI, with the Ag[Al(O t BuF)4]. Despite the bulk of the carbazolyl moiety, the silylenylium cation [RSi]+ retains high reactivity. It was shown to react with an amine to form three bonds at the silicon atom in one reaction which conforms with the notion of a &#8220;supersilylene&#8221;. The resulting silylium cation [RSi(H)NR&#8217;2]+ (in the formal oxidation state SiIV) obtained by oxidative addition of an NH bond at [RSi]+ is even more acidic than the silylenylium cation (SiII) due to the absence of a lone pair of electrons the silicon atom.</dc:description>

Polymers containing an &#969;&#8208;OH end&#8208;group and only ethyl carbamate main&#8208;chain repeat units rapidly degrade in NaOH solution via an &#969;&#8594;&#945; depolymerization mechanism with no apparent sign of random chain cleavage.

      <title>Hydroxamic Acids Immobilized on Resins (HAIRs): A Toolbox for the Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Targeting HDAC Inhibitors and HDAC Degraders (PROTACs)</title>
      <dc:description>Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.</dc:description>

      <title>Intervening Tumor Progression by Coupling Bacteria Respiration with Tumor Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>By virtue of the unique feature of  Shewanella oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 (  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1) that anaerobically catabolize lactate through transferring electrons to metal minerals for respiration, a lactate&#8208;fueled biohybrid (Bac@MnO  2  ) here is constructed by modifying manganese dioxide (MnO  2  ) nanoflowers on the  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 surface. The biohybrid Bac@MnO  2  assigns decorated MnO  2  nanoflowers as electrons receptor and tumor metabolite of lactate as electrons donor to build complete bacteria respiration pathway in tumor sites, which results in continuously burning of intercellular lactate. Additionally, decorated MnO  2  nanoflowers can also catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to generate oxygen (O  2  ), which could originally prevent lactate production by downregulating hypoxia inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) expression.

      <title>Sharp Switching of DNAzyme Activity through the Formation of a Cu(II)&#8208;mediated Carboxyimidazole Base Pair</title>
      <dc:description>DNAzymes are widely used as functional units for creating DNA&#8208;based sensors and devices. Switching of DNAzyme activity by external stimuli is of increasing interest. Herein we report a Cu  II  &#8208;responsive DNAzyme rationally designed by incorporating one of the most stabilizing artificial metallo&#8208;base pairs, a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated carboxyimidazole base pair (  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  ), into a known RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme. Cleavage of the substrate was suppressed without Cu  II  , but the reaction proceeded efficiently in the presence of Cu  II  ions. This is due to the induction of a catalytically active structure by  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  pairing. The on&#8211;off ratio was as high as 12&#8208;fold, which far exceeds that of the previous DNAzyme having a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated hydroxypyridone base pair. The DNAzyme activity was regulated in response specifically to Cu  II  ions during the reaction via addition, removal, and reduction of Cu  II  .

      <title>Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with H2O (D2O) as the H (D) Source over a Pd&#8208;P Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Developing a facile controllable avenue to selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with a defined configuration using a cheap and safe hydrogen donor is highly desirable, but remains a big challenge. Here, we reported a selective semihydrogenation (deuteration) of numerous terminal and internal alkynes using H  2  O (D  2  O) as the H (D) source over a Pd&#8208;P alloy cathode at a lower potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the doping of P caused the enhanced specific adsorption of alkynes and the promoted intrinsic activity for producing adsorbed atomic hydrogen (H*  ads  ) from water electrolysis. The semihydrogenation of alkynes could be accomplished at a lower potential with up to 99% selectivity and 78% Faraday efficiency of alkene products, outperforming pure Pd and commercial Pd/C. This electrochemical semihydrogenation of alkynes might proceed via a H*  ads  addition pathway rather than a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. The decreased amount of H  ads  at lower potential and the more preferential adsorption of the Pd&#8208;P to C&#8801;C &#960; bond than C=C moiety resulted in the excellent alkene selectivity. The thermodynamically unstable but synthetically significant  Z  &#8208;alkenes with &gt; 99%  Z  selectivity were expediently accessed. This method is capable of producing the synthetically more useful but highly challenged mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;deuterated alkenes with up to 99% deuterium incorporation. The paired production of crucial industrial feedstock adiponitrile at anode and alkene at the cathode in a Pd&#8208;P || NiSe two&#8208;electrode system demonstrated its promising potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Descriptor &#916;GC&#8208;O Enables the Quantitative Design of Spontaneously Blinking Rhodamines for Live&#8208;Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Spontaneously blinking dyes eliminated the requirements of intense laser irradiations and additives to induce fluorophore blinking and greatly facilitated single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution imaging. While the spontaneously blinking had been demonstrated via the thermally induced spirocyclization equilibrium of rhodamines, the stringent requirement on this equilibrium sets a formidable obstacle for the creation of multi&#8208;colored spontaneously blinking rhodamines. Consequently, only a few such dyes were developed to date. Herein, we reported a simple, fast, and quantitative theoretical descriptor &#916;  G  C&#8208;O  that allows accurate predictions of a wide range of spontaneously blinking rhodamines. &#916;  G  C&#8208;O  denotes the Gibbs free energy differences between the closed and open forms of rhodamines and has a good linear relationship with experimental p  K  cycl  values. This correlation affords an effective guide for the quantitative designs of spontaneously blinking rhodamines and eliminates trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. We have validated the prediction power of &#916;  G  C&#8208;O  via the development of two spontaneously blinking rhodamines of different colors and enhanced brightness. We also demonstrated their super&#8208;resolution imaging utilities in dynamic live&#8208;cell imaging. We expect that &#916;  G  C&#8208;O  will greatly facilitate the efficient creations of spontaneously blinking fluorophores and aid the advancements of super&#8208;resolution bioimaging techniques for bioimaging applications.</dc:description>

      <title>A simple biosystem for the high&#8208;yielding cascade conversion of racemic alcohols to enantiopure amines</title>

      <title>How far does energy migrate in DNA and cause damage? Evidence for long&#8208;range photodamage to DNA</title>
      <dc:description>A new DNA architecture addresses the question, how far energy migrates in DNA and forms cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as photodamages causing skin cancer. The 3&#8208;methoxyxanthone nucleoside allows site&#8208;selective photoenergy injection into DNA. The designated CPD site lacks the phosphodiester bond and can be placed in defined distances. The CPD formation links two oligonucleotides together and allows probing by gel electrophoresis. We obtained a sigmoidal distance dependence with R  0  of 25&#177;3 &#197;. Below R  0  , short&#8208;range energy migration occurs with high CPD yields and shallow distance dependence, characteristic for a coherent process. 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;C as epigenetic modification on the 3&#8217;&#8208;side facilitates CPD formation. Above R  0  , long&#8208;range incoherent energy migration occurs over 30 A&#8208;T pairs (105.4 &#197;). The evidence of long&#8208;range CPD formation is fundamental for our understanding of DNA photodamaging.</dc:description>
