      <title>Stereoinduction in Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metallaphotoredox catalysis has evolved into an enabling platform to construct C(sp3)&#8208;hybridized centers under remarkably mild reaction conditions. The cultivation of abundant radical precursor feedstocks has significantly increased the scope of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, especially with respect to C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) linkages.

      <title>Biosynthesis of Indole Diterpene Lolitrems: Radical&#8208;Induced Cyclization of an Epoxyalcohol Affording a Characteristic Lolitremane Skeleton</title>
      <dc:description>Lolitrems  are tremorgenic indole diterpenes that exhibit a unique 5/6 bicyclic system of the indole&#160; moiety. Although genetic analysis has indicated that prenyltransferase LtmE and cytochrome P450 LtmJ are involved in the construction of this unique structure, the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway for lolitrems employing a recently established genome&#8208;editing technique for the expression host Aspergillus oryzae. Heterologous expression and bioconversion of the various intermediates revealed that LtmJ catalyzes multistep oxidation to furnish the lolitrem core. We also isolated the key reaction intermediate with an epoxyalcohol moiety. This observation allowed us to establish the mechanism of radical&#8208;induced cyclization, which was firmly supported by density functional theory calculations and a model experiment with a synthetic analog.</dc:description>

      <title>Electroreduction of CO2 to Formate with low overpotential using Cobalt Pyridine Thiolate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added products provides a viable alternative to the use of carbon sources derived from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the ability to carry out these transformations at reasonable energetic costs, e.g. with low overpotential, remains a significant challenge. Molecular catalysts offer a great option in this context, as fine control of their activity and selectivity can be obtained via the tuning of their coordination sphere and ligand set. To this end, we investigated here a series of cheap cobalt(III) pyridine&#8208;thiolate complexes as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The effect of the ligands and proton sources on activity was examined. We were able to identify [bipyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinethiolato)&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;hexaflurophosphate] as a highly selective catalyst for formate production operating at a very low overpotential of 110 mV to achieve a TOF of 10 s&#8208;1. Detailed electrokinetic analysis coupled with density functional theory allowed establishing a mechanistic pathway for these catalysts, highlighting the role of key metal hydride intermediates. The catalysts deactivate via the formation of stable Co carbonyl complexes, but we demonstrated that the active species could be regenerated upon oxidation and release of coordinated CO ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands: design, syntheses and applications in asymmetric catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The creation of new chiral ligands capable of providing high stereocontrol in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions is crucial in modern organic synthesis.

      <title>Polarization Effect in Surface Plasmon&#8208;Induced Photocatalysis on Au/TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the interaction of polarization light with an asymmetric nanostructure such as a metal/semiconductor heterostructure provides opportunities for tuning the surface plasmon excitation and near&#8208;field spatial distribution.

      <title>Cationic Lipid&#8208;based Intracellular Delivery of Bacterial Effectors for Rewiring Malignant Cell Signaling</title>

      <title>Ambient Chemical Fixation of CO2 Using a Robust Ag27 Cluster&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Coinage metals (Cu, Ag, Au)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used in organic synthesis chemistry, however, robust and  heterogeneous silver&#8208;based catalysts are hard to access due to its high photosensitivity and chemical instability. Herein, the unprecedented double S  2  &#8722;  templated Ag  27  clusters have been stabilized by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP&#8208;H  2  ) ligands to afford a robust 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (  Ag27&#8208;MOF  ). This silver cluster&#8208;assembled material serves as a highly efficient (TON &gt; 1000) heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclization of both terminal and internal propargylamines with CO  2  under atmospheric pressure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope are attributable to the saddle&#8208;shaped metallic node in  Ag27&#8208;MOF  , which features an accessible platform with high&#8208;density silver atoms as  &#960;  &#8208;Lewis acid sites for activating C&#8801;C triple bonds.

      <title>Heat&#8208;Free Biomimetic Metal Molding on Soft Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Fabrication of bio&#8208;templated metallic structures is limited by differences in properties, processing condition, packing, and material state. Herein, we demonstrate that using undercooled metal particles, differences in modulus and processing temperatures can be overcome. Similarly, adoption of autonomous processes like self&#8208;filtration, capillary pressure and evaporative concentration leads to enhanced packing, stabilization (jamming) and point sintering with phase change to create solid metal replicas of complex bio&#8208;based features. Differentiation of subtle differences between cultivars of the rose flower with reproduction over large areas shows that this BIOmimetic Metal Patterning (BIOMAP) is a versatile method to readily replicate biological features either as positive or negative reliefs irrespective of the substrate. Using rose petal patterns, we illustrate the versatility of bio&#8208;templated mapping with undercooled metal particles at ambient conditions, and with unprecedented efficiency for metal structures.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of bio&#8208;templated metallic structures is limited by differences in properties, processing condition, packing, and material state. Herein, we demonstrate that using undercooled metal particles, differences in modulus and processing temperatures can be overcome. Similarly, adoption of autonomous processes like self&#8208;filtration, capillary pressure and evaporative concentration leads to enhanced packing, stabilization (jamming) and point sintering with phase change to create solid metal replicas of complex bio&#8208;based features. Differentiation of subtle differences between cultivars of the rose flower with reproduction over large areas shows that this BIOmimetic Metal Patterning (BIOMAP) is a versatile method to readily replicate biological features either as positive or negative reliefs irrespective of the substrate. Using rose petal patterns, we illustrate the versatility of bio&#8208;templated mapping with undercooled metal particles at ambient conditions, and with unprecedented efficiency for metal structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photorelease of Pyridines Using the Metal&#8208;free Photoremovable Protecting Group</title>
      <dc:description>Photorelease of bioactive molecules has emerged as a valuable tool in biochemistry. Nevertheless, many important bioactive molecules, such as pyridine derivatives&#65292;cannot benefit from currently available organic photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs). We found that inefficient photorelease of pyridines is attributed to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from PPGs to pyridiniums. To alleviate PET, we rationally designed a strategy to drive excited state of PPG from S  1  to T  1  with heavy atom, and synthesized a new PPG by substitution of atom H at 3&#8208;position of 7&#8208;Dietheylamino&#8208;coumarin&#8208;4&#8208;methyl (  DEACM  ) with Br or I. This resulted in an improved photolytic efficiency of the pyridinium with hundreds of times in water solution. The PPG can be applied to various pyridine derivatives. The successful photorelease of a microtubule inhibitor, indibulin, in living cells was demonstrated for the potential application of this strategy in biochemical research.</dc:description>

      <title>Meta Junction Promoting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The meta junction is proposed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers. Based on triphenylamine as D and dicyanobenzene as A, as a proof of concept, a series of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers has been developed by changing their connection sites. When the junction between D and A is tuned from para to meta, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;  E  ST  ) is found to be significantly decreased from 0.44 to 0.10 eV because of the increasing hole&#8208;electron separation.

      <title>Controlling residual lithium in high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90 %) lithium layered oxides for cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The rampant generation of lithium hydroxide and carbonate impurities, commonly known as &#8216;residual lithium&#8217;, is a practical obstacle to the mass&#8208;scale synthesis and handling of high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90%) layered oxides and their use as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we suggest a simple  in situ  method to control the residual lithium chemistry of a high&#8208;nickel lithium layered oxide, Li(Ni  0.91  Co  0.06  Mn  0.03  )O  2  (NCM9163), with minimal side effects. Based on thermodynamic considerations of the preferred reactions, we systematically designed a synthesis process that preemptively converts residual Li  2  O (the origin of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  ) into a more stable compound by injecting reactive SO  2  gas. The preformed lithium sulfate thin film significantly suppresses the generation of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  during both synthesis and storage, thereby mitigating slurry gelation and gas evolution and improving the cycle stability. This simple and versatile approach is thus a promising practical solution to overcome the residual lithium issues currently encountered on mass production lines.</dc:description>

The formed well&#8208;defined end&#8208;capped polyethylene&#8211;iodine (PE&#8211;I) species is very stable upon storage. Molar&#8208;mass distributions with dispersities around 1.6 were obtained up to number average molar masses  M  n  of 7300 g&#160;mol  &#8208;1  .

By fine tuning the ethylene pressure and the vinyl acetate content, a broad range of copolymers containing from 0 to 85 mol% of VAc unit was achieved. By reactivating the iodo chain&#8208;end, block copolymer structures composed of ethylene and VAc such as poly(ethylene&#8208;  co  &#8208;vinyl acetate)&#8208;  b  &#8208;polyethylene (EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PE) or gradient block copopolymers EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;EVA with different content of VAc in the blocks were obtained for the first time using ITP. This highly versatile synthetic platform provides a straightforward access to a diverse range of well&#8208;defined PE based polymer materials. Finally, reactivity trends were explored by a theoretical mechanistic study.</dc:description>

By reactivating the iodo chain&#8208;end, block copolymer structures composed of ethylene and VAc such as poly(ethylene&#8208;  co  &#8208;vinyl acetate)&#8208;  b  &#8208;polyethylene (EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PE) or gradient block copopolymers EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;EVA with different content of VAc in the blocks were obtained for the first time using ITP. This highly versatile synthetic platform provides a straightforward access to a diverse range of well&#8208;defined PE based polymer materials. Finally, reactivity trends were explored by a theoretical mechanistic study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Identifying a&#160;Real Catalyst&#160;of [NiFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimic&#160;for Exceptional H2 Photogeneration</title>

Experimental studies of in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborated a dimeric structure of  2  as a closed&#8208;shell, symmetric structure with Ru  I  center. The isolated dimer  2  showed a real catalytic role&#160;in photocatalysis (TOF 1936 h  &#8208;1  ) for H  2  evolution.

      <title>An enzymatic platform for the highy enantioselective and stereodivergent construction of cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones</title>
      <dc:description>The development of enzymes capable of mediating abiological reactions offers new opportunities for sustainable chemistry. Here we report the development of biological catalysts derived from sperm whale myoglobin that exploit a carbene transfer mechanism for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones, which are key structural motifs found in many biologically active natural products.

Through an alternate evolutionary trajectory, a stereodivergent biocatalyst was also obtained for affording mirror&#8208;image forms of the desired bicyclic products. In combination with whole&#8208;cell transformations, the myoglobin&#8208;based biocatalyst was readily applied to enable the asymmetric construction of a cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone scaffold at a gram scale.

      <title>Thermochromic meltable materials with "reverse spin transition" controlled by chemical design</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of meltable Fe  II  complexes, which, depending on the length of aliphatic chains, display abrupt &#8220;forward&#8221; low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin transition or unprecedented melting&#8208;triggered &#8220;reverse&#8221; high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin transition on temperature rise. The &#8220;reverse spin transition&#8221; is perfectly reproducible on thermal cycling and the obtained materials are easily processable in the form of thin film due to soft matter nature.

      <title>Controlling CO2 hydrogenation selectivity by metal&#8208;support electron transfer under reaction conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning CO 2  hydrogenation selectivity to obtain targeted value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels has attracted great yet ever&#8208;increasing attention. However, a fundamental understanding of the nature to control the selectivity is still lacking, posing a challenge in catalyst design and development. Here, we report our new discovery in ambient pressure CO 2  hydrogenation reaction where selectivity can be completely reversed by simply changing the crystal phases of TiO 2  support (anatase &#8208; or rutile&#8208;TiO 2  ) or changing metal loadings on anatase&#8208;TiO 2  . Operando spectroscopy and NAP&#8208;XPS studies reveal the determining factor is electron transfer from metal to support under reaction conditions most probably caused by hydrogen spillover, which changes the adsorption and activation of the intermediate of CO. Based on this new finding, we can not only regulate CO 2  hydrogenation selectivity but also tune catalytic performance in other important reactions, thus opening up a door for efficient catalyst development by rational design.</dc:description>

      <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide in Metallic Nanopores through a Pincer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Metallic catalysts with nanopores are advantageous on improving both activity and selectivity, while the reason behind that remains unclear all along. In this work, porous Zn nanoparticles (P&#8208;Zn) were adopted as a model catalyst to investigate the catalytic behavior of metallic nanopores. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that the concave surface of nanopores works like a pincer to capture and clamp CO  2  and H  2  O precursors simultaneously, thus lowering the energy barriers of CO  2  electroreduction. Resultantly, the pincer mechanism endows P&#8208;Zn with a high Faradic efficiency (98.1%) towards CO production at the potential of &#8208;0.95 V vs. RHE. Moreover, DFT calculation demonstrates that Co and Cu nanopores exhibit the pincer behavior as well, suggesting that this mechanism is universal for metallic nanopores.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Activity and Stability Origin of BiVO4 Photoanodes with FeNi Oxyhydroxides for Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the origin of formation and active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalysts is highly required for solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices that generate hydrogen efficiently from water. Herein, we employed a simple pH&#8208;modulated method for in&#8208;situ growth of FeNi oxyhydroxide ultrathin&#8208;layers on BiVO 4  photoanodes, resulting in one of the highest currently known PEC activities of 5.8 mA&#8201;cm &#8722;2  (1.23 V RHE  , AM 1.5G) accompanied with an excellent stability. More importantly, both comparative experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies clearly reveal that the selective formation of Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Fe interfacial bonds mainly contributes the enhanced OER activities, while the construction of V&#8208;O&#8208;Ni interfacial bonds effectively restrains the dissolution of V 5+  ions and promotes the OER stability. Thereby, the synergy between iron and nickel of FeNi oxyhydroxides significantly improved the PEC water oxidation properties of BiVO 4  photoanodes. These results offer the unique insights into the crucial roles of bimetallic OER cocatalysts, which have significant implications for the design and construction of highly efficient PEC devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Endo&#8208;selective Epoxide&#8208;opening Cascade for Fast Assembly of the Polycyclic Core Structure of Marine Ladder Polyethers</title>
      <dc:description>Rapid synthesis of marine ladder polyethers from polyepoxide precursors (in analogy with the biosynthetic pathway hypothesized by Nakanishi) is hampered by the fact that the exo  &#8208;selective epoxide&#8208;opening cyclization cascade that gives THF&#8208;type polyethers is preferred over the endo  &#8208;selective cascade that gives the desired products. We found that perfluoro&#8208; tert  &#8208;butanol (PFTB) cooperates with 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM]BF 4  ) can promote endo  &#8208;selective epoxide&#8208;opening cyclization reactions of trisubstituted epoxy alcohols. Starting from readily accessible homochiral polyepoxy alcohols with a methyl group at all the endo  &#8208;cyclization sites, we were able to construct polyethers up to five consecutive fused 6&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and/or 8&#8208;membered rings in one step. Notably, molecules with the 7/7/6/6 and 7/7/6/7/6 polyether frameworks of hemibrevetoxin B and brevenal, respectively, could be synthesized in 40% and 17% chemical yields.</dc:description>

      <title>A Generalizable and Noncovalent Strategy of Interfacing Aptamers with Microelectrode for Selective Sensing of Neurotransmitter In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Selective probing of neurochemicals is essential for understanding the chemical basis of brain function and pathology. To this aim, interfacing excellent recognition features of aptamers with in vivo compatible carbon fiber microelectrode (CFE)&#8208;based electroanalytical system offers a plausible means, however, is significantly challenged in terms of coupling chemistry, stability, and versatility. Here, we present a new interfacial functionalization strategy created through the assembly of aptamer cholesterol amphiphiles (aptCAs) onto the alkyl chain&#8208;functionalized CFE. We show that the noncovalent cholesterol&#8208;alkyl chain interactions are capable of effectively immobilizing aptamers onto CFE surface. Moreover, the strategy is generalizable, facile, and applicable of synergizing the merits of microelectrode and aptamers, allowing the generation of a highly selective bioelectronic system for probing neurochemical dynamics in living systems. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of using noncovalent cholesterol&#8208;based anchoring of aptamers to carbon&#8208;based electrodes, opening up a vast array of new opportunities for designing in vivo sensors to exploring brain chemistry.</dc:description>

However, functionalization of C&#8208;C bonds by controlled cleavage remains difficult and challenging because they are inert.

Characterization and control experiments disclose that cobalt nanoparticles are responsible for the successive cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds to achieve excellent catalytic activity, while the presence of Co&#8208;N  x  has just the opposite effect.

      <dc:description>It is of great significance to track the platinum drugs in real time with super&#8208;resolution to elucidate their mechanism of action, such as their behavior and distribution in live cells, for drug development. However, it is always challenging to design  platinum complexes suitable for such research. Here, we design a  luminescent  building block (  L  ) for metal complexes and a dinuclear platinum complex (  Pt  2  L  ) for super&#8208;resolution imaging. Because of its super&#8208;large Stokes shift and excellent photophysical properties,  Pt  2  L  is capable of serving as an ideal candidate for super&#8208;resolution imaging with extremely low luminescence background and high photobleaching resistance. Moreover, upon light stimulation, a matter flux of  Pt  2  L  escaping from autolysosomes to nucleus was observed, which represents a new transportation path. Utilizing the photoactivated escape properties, we can regulate the nuclear accessibility of  Pt  2  L  form autolysosomes with photo&#8208;selectivity, which provides a new way to improve the targeting of platinum drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Pendant Alkoxy Groups on N&#8208;Aryl Substitutions Drive the Efficiency of Imidazolylidene Catalysts for Homoenolate Annulation from Enal and Aldehyde</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate generated from an imidazolylidene catalyst and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde forms a conjugated Breslow intermediate. This is a critical step affecting the efficiency of the NHC&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone formation via homoenolate addition to aryl aldehydes. A novel type of imidazolylidene catalyst with pendant alkoxy groups on the ortho&#8208;N&#8208;aryl groups is described. Catalyst of this sort facilitates the formation of the conjugated Breslow intermediate. Studies of the rate constants for homoenolate annulation affording &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones, reveal that introduction of the oxygen atoms in the appropriate position of the N&#8208;aryl substituents can increase the efficiency of imidazolylidene catalysts. Structural and mechanistic studies revealed that pendant alkoxy groups can be located close to the proton of the tetrahedral intermediate, thereby facilitating the proton transfer.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection with Strong Polarization&#8208;Sensitivity in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Hybrid Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>Polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet (UV) photodetection is highly indispensable in military and civilian applications and has been demonstrated with various wide&#8208;band photodetectors. However, it still remains elusive to achieve the self&#8208;powered devices, which can be operated in the absence of external bias. Herein, for the first time, ferroelectricity&#8208;driven self&#8208;powered photodetection towards polarized UV light was successfully demonstrated in a 2D wide&#8208;bandgap hybrid ferroelectric (BPA)  2  PbBr  4  (BPA = 3&#8208;bromopropylammonium) (  1  ). We found that the prominent spontaneous polarization in  1  results in a bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of 0.85 V, that independently drives photoexcited carriers separation and transport and thus supports self&#8208;powered ability. Emphatically, this self&#8208;powered detector show a strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity to the linearly polarized UV illumination with an impressive polarization ratio up to 6. 8, which is greatly superior to that of previously reported UV&#8208;polarized photodetectors (  e.g.  ZnO, GaN and GeS  2  ). As pioneering work, this work presents a paradigm for achieving self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection with strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity by integrating ferroelectricity into hybrid halide perovskites.</dc:description>

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE): A Historical Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
An old phenomenon in a new light: In this brief Essay, the currently highly recognized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon is discussed in a broader perspective by illustrating its roots in earlier work.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has attracted considerable interest over the last twenty years. In contrast to the large number of available reviews focusing specifically on AIE, this Essay discusses the AIE phenomenon from a broader perspective, with an emphasis on early observations related to AIE made long before the term was coined. Illustrative examples are highlighted from the 20th century where fluorescence enhancement upon rigidification of dyes in viscous or solid environments or J&#8208;aggregate formation was studied. It is shown that these examples already include typical AIE luminogens such as tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as well as stilbenes and oligo&#8208; or polyphenylenevinylenes and &#8208;ethynylenes, which became important fluorescent solid&#8208;state materials in OLED research in the 1990s. Further examples include cyanine dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) or its dimers (TOTOs), which have been widely applied as molecular probes in nucleic acid research. The up to 10&#8201;000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement of such dyes upon intercalation into double&#8208;stranded DNA, attributable to the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) concept, afforded commercial products for bioimaging and fluorescence sensing applications already in the early 1990s.

      <dc:description>Reported here is a synergistic enhancement strategy for realizing ultralong bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), involving polymerization between phosphor monomers and acrylamide and host&#8208;guest complexation interaction between phosphors and  cucurbit[6, 7, 8]urils  (CB[6, 7, 8]). The non&#8208;phosphorescent monomers exhibit 2.46 s ultralong lifetime after copolymerizing with acrylamide. The immense improvement is because of the rich hydrogen bond and carbonyl within the polymers which promote intersystem crossing (ISC), suppress nonradiative relaxation and shield quenchers effectively. By tuning the ratio of chromophores, a series of phosphorescent copolymers with different lifetimes and quantum yields are prepared. Significantly, the complexation of macrocyclic hosts CB[6, 7, 8] promote the RTP of polymers by blocking aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), and offsetting the losses of aforementioned interaction provided by polymer. Moreover, multiple lifetime&#8208;encoding for digit and character encryption are achieved by utilizing the difference of their lifetimes, demonstrating great potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This synergistic enhancement strategy provides a new approach for realizing high&#8208;performance RTP.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Deuteration of Halides with D2O as the Deuterium Source over a Copper Nanowire Arrays Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Precise deuterium incorporation with controllable deuterated sites and amount is extremely desirable. Here, a facile and efficient electrocatalytic deuterodehalogenation of halides using heavy water (D  2  O) as the deuteration reagent and electrochemical in situ formed copper nanowire arrays (Cu NWAs) as the cathode was demonstrated. A cross&#8208;coupling of carbon and deuterium free radicals might be involved for this ipso&#8208;selective deuteration. This method exhibited excellent chemoselectivity and high compatibility with the easily reducible functional groups such as C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, C=N, and C&#8801;N bonds. The C&#8211;H to C&#8211;D transformations were successfully achieved with high yields and deuterium ratios through a one&#8208;pot halogenation&#8208;deuterodehalogenation process.

      <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanism Since the 1930s:
Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>The first Cope Award was presented in 1973 to R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann (the only shared Cope Award). In his award lecture, Woodward described his fascination in his early teens with the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Beginning in the late 1930s with his B.S. and Ph.D. theses and extending throughout his career, Woodward studied the mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and used it extensively in his total syntheses. This article describes the evolution of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8208;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. There was much debate in the chemical literature about the validity of Woodward&#8217;s early mechanisms, especially with Michael Dewar. However, as discussed in this paper, many of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic hypotheses have turned out to be valid. Modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis&#8208;pericyclic transition states. This mechanistic type was first discovered in 2002 by the late Pierluigi Caramella from Pavia, Italy. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition that Woodward and Hoffmann predicted in 1965, and that Houk studied experimentally as a graduate student. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8208;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions, in solvents and in enzymes, provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how Woodward&#8217;s favorite reactions occur. &#160; Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward&#8217;s youth to today&#8217;s trajectory simulations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dearomatization/Debromination Strategy for the [4+1] Spiroannulation of Bromophenols with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Imines</title>
      <dc:description>A novel [4+1] spiroannulation of o&#8208; &amp; p&#8208;bromophenols with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines has been developed for the direct synthesis of a new family of azaspirocyclic molecules. Notably, several other halophenols (X = Cl, I) were also applicable for this transformation. Moreover, a catalytic asymmetric version of the reaction was realized with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols by using a chiral Sc(III)/Py&#8208;Box catalyst. Mechanistic studies revealed that this domino reaction proceeded through electrophile&#8208;triggered dearomatization of phenol derivatives at their halogenated positions and followed by halogen&#8208;displacement with N&#8208;nucleophiles via a radical&#8208;based SRN1 mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Mineral Respiration: How Iron Hemes Synchronize Electron Transfer Rates</title>
      <dc:description>
The bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens requires extracellular metal salts for respiration. Each microorganism produces 5&#215;105 electrons per second, which reduce the metal ions bound to the outer membrane cytochromes. With iron heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes, the electron flow is independent of the concentration and type of oxidant. This results in ATP homeostasis.







Abstract
Anaerobic microorganisms of the Geobacter genus are effective electron sources for the synthesis of nanoparticles, for bioremediation of polluted water, and for the production of electricity in fuel cells. In multistep reactions, electrons are transferred via iron/heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes from the inner cell membrane to extracellular metal ions, which are bound to outer membrane cytochromes. We measured electron production and electron flux rates to 5&#215;105&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1 per G.&#8197;sulfurreducens. Remarkably, these rates are independent of the oxidants, and follow zero order kinetics. It turned out that the microorganisms regulate electron flux rates by increasing their Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in the multiheme cytochromes whenever the activity of the extracellular metal oxidants is diminished. By this mechanism the respiration remains constant even when oxidizing conditions are changing. This homeostasis is a vital condition for living systems, and makes G.&#8197;sulfurreducens a versatile electron source.

      <title>Automated, Accelerated Nanoscale Synthesis of Iminopyrrolidines</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi 3&#8208;component reaction is described. I&#8208;DOT was used to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. The reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups.







Abstract
Miniaturization and acceleration of synthetic chemistry is an emerging area in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research and development. Herein, we describe the synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction. We used I&#8208;DOT, a positive&#8208;pressure&#8208;based low&#8208;volume and non&#8208;contact dispensing technology to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. In general, the reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups. We exemplify a pipeline of fast and efficient nanomole&#8208;scale scouting to millimole&#8208;scale synthesis for the discovery of a useful novel reaction with great scope.
