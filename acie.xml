         <title>Unlocking Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Beyond via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalent strategy to activate and enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free chromophores through external heavy&#8208;atom engineering (HAE) is reported. Incorporating these chromophores into halogen&#8208;rich polymer matrices brings them into close spatial proximity with heavy atoms, thereby facilitating the intersystem crossing process via external HAE and thus unlocking RTP.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from purely organic materials holds great potential for optoelectronic and bioimaging applications; however, its realization remains challenging due to inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and rapid nonradiative decay. Herein, we present an effective strategy to activate and enhance RTP in heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free chromophores through external heavy&#8208;atom engineering (HAE). By dispersing these chromophores within hydrophobic halogen&#8208;rich polymer matrices, external HAE is employed to enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling and promote efficient ISC. The generality of this strategy is demonstrated across a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and further extended to other heterocyclic chromophores, affording bright (phosphorescence quantum yields up to 61.6%) and long&#8208;lived (phosphorescence lifetimes up to 273&#160;ms) RTP materials under ambient conditions, with emission wavelengths spanning from 500 to 700&#160;nm. This supramolecular approach circumvents the need for covalent introduction of heavy atoms to the luminophores, thereby preserving their intrinsic photophysical properties while unlocking desirable triplet&#8208;state emissions. Overall, the current external HAE strategy provides a versatile platform for the construction of high&#8208;performance organic RTP materials, offering new insights into the design principles of organic RTP systems and broadening the material landscape for optoelectronic and bioimaging applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Upcycling of All&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Backbone Degradable Polyethylene with Dispersed On&#8208;Chain Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;carbon&#8208;backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) is synthesized through incorporating phenyl ketone group into the on&#8208;chain of PE, which balances stability and degradability of PE material and possesses dispersed distribution of on&#8208;chain keto group. Under ambient UVA light, these polar, upgrading PE material achieves complete conversion of ketone with significantly higher efficiency, producing well&#8208;defined telechelic PE oligomers, which serve as intermediates for upcycling into value&#8208;added PLA&#8211;PE&#8211;PLA triblock copolymers.








Abstract
The challenges of photodegradable polyolefins, which have attracted much attention, persist in achieving controlled synthesis, efficient degradation, and chemical upcycling. Here, we report an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) incorporating on&#8208;chain ketones through coordination&#8211;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and the optimal phenyl vinyl ketone (PVK). This strategy enables precise control over the chain structure, including PVK dispersed distribution (0.3&#8211;8.3 mol%), saturated Csp3&#8211;Csp3 backbone, and enhanced surface properties while retaining thermomechanical properties. Crucially, this is the first report that achieves the quantitative conversion (100%) of ketone units in photodegradable PE under ambient UVA light (&#955; = 390&#8211;395&#160;nm) with high efficiency. Mechanistic studies on photodegradation reveal two competitive pathways: Norrish Type II scission and Norrish&#8211;Yang cyclization (&#8764;50% for each), yielding well&#8208;defined telechelic PE oligomers. These insights allow predictable control over molecular weight of degraded product, enabling tailored polymer design. Photodegradation coupled with in situ thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry generates hydroxyl&#8208;terminated telechelic PE oligomers, which are upcycled into PLA&#8211;PE&#8211;PLA triblock copolymers, exhibiting excellent compatibility in HDPE/PLA blends. This work bridges the gap between PE degradation and upcycling, unifying customizable synthesis, controlled degradation, and value&#8208;added upcycling into a single platform for sustainable polyolefins.

         <title>The Chemistry of Space: From Crystallographic Abstraction to Framework Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved from a structural curiosity into one of the most dynamic areas of modern chemistry. In celebration of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, this Highlight reflects on their remarkable journey and the prospects that lie ahead.








Abstract
The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry celebrates the groundbreaking development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which revolutionised porous materials through the application of crystallography and reticular chemistry principles. Building on the pioneering contributions of Kitagawa, Robson, and Yaghi, MOF chemistry is now pursued with a level of precision comparable to that long established in molecular chemistry. Looking ahead, the field is exploring dynamic frameworks, defect engineering, and expanding practical applications, all in pursuit of designing high&#8208;performance materials driven by molecular design to meet pressing societal challenges.

         <title>Fragmentation of Isoxazolones to Alkynes Enabled by Anomeric Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evidence that anomeric amides can serve as nitrenium ion precursors in reactions with nitrogen nucleophiles other than amines is reported. Building on this finding, we developed a mild, scalable, and highly chemoselective method for the fragmentation of isoxazolones to alkynes. This transformation constitutes unique functional group interconversion &#8208; alkyne from &#946;&#8208;ketoester. 








Abstract
Over the past few years, isodiazenes have reemerged as an important class of intermediates with substantial synthetic potential. The most direct route to these reactive species is via reactions of N&#8208;nucleophiles with nitrenium ion precursors (e.g., anomeric amides). While emerging methodologies are almost exclusively focused on amine&#8208;derived isodiazenes, analogous transformations based on other nitrogen functionalities (e.g., oximes, heterocycles) are largely overlooked. Herein, we present evidence that the reactivity of nitrenium ion precursors can be expanded beyond its current scope, supported by the development of an unprecedented reaction between anomeric amides and isoxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. This unorthodox transformation provides an operationally simple, scalable, and highly chemoselective route to challenging sterically hindered alkynes. Moreover, we demonstrate that anomeric amides can behave as surrogates of nitrosonium cation.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of P(V) Skeleton via Catalytic Desymmetric Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advance in the construction of enantioenriched stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;P(V) compounds via catalytic asymmetric desymmetric substitution strategy, which is divided into two pathways including nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution.








Abstract
Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;P(V) skeletons exist ubiquitously in drugs, agrochemicals, organocatalysts, ligands and materials. Conventional synthetic methods mainly rely on chromatographic resolution, chiral auxiliary induction and optically active substrate control. Catalytic asymmetric transformation as an economic pathway has received much progress via racemic substrate resolution and desymmetrization of prochiral precursors. Among them, catalytic desymmetric substitution strategy has recently emerged as a new and powerful route to construct P(V) stereocenter, particularly witnessed a series of achievements in preparing seldom studied fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted P(V) scaffolds in the past one year. This minireview aims to provide a timely summary and highlight on this rapidly developing field, including reaction design, synthesis, mechanism and applications, and also perspective on the potential limitations and future trend.

         <title>Long Single&#8208;Stranded DNA with Site&#8208;Specific Modifications to Enable Single&#8208;Base&#8208;Resolution Epigenetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust one&#8208;pot synthesis of long single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with precise site&#8208;specific modifications. When applied to 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) patterns and CRISPR/HDR, this method enables single&#8208;base resolution epigenetic manipulation and uncovers synergistic density effects in methylation maintenance. 








Abstract
We report a method for synthesizing site&#8208;specifically modified long single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high purity and fidelity. With the successful synthesis of long ssDNA carrying different 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) patterns, single&#8208;base&#8208;resolution analysis of 5mC epigenetic dynamics at specific genomic loci were enabled in mammalian cells. The results revealed that the density of 5mC sites synergistically correlated with their maintenance. This study opens new avenues for precise epigenetic manipulation and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Programmed Pore Engineering in an Isoreticular Triazole&#8211;MOF Series for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed hydrogen&#8208;bond modulation within aminotriazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) creates supramolecular interlocks in ZSTU&#8208;30 that invert a usual adsorption order, enabling CO2&#8208;preferred removal, cascading separation C2H2, and obtaining polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from ternary gas mixtures in a single step. 








Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification from CO2/C2H2/C2H4 ternary mixtures is industrially crucial yet remains highly challenging. Current metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack the ideal CO2&#160;&gt;&#160;C2H2&#160;&gt;&#160;C2H4 adsorption sequence necessary for stepwise removal of impurities. Herein, we address this gap through precise pore environment tuning within an isoreticular series of zinc&#8211;triazole MOFs. By modulating the number and position of &#9472;NH2/&#9472;CH3 groups on the ligand, we precisely control pore chemistry from one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) interconnected channels, which successfully achieves the targeted adsorption order. The unilateral amino groups in the optimized MOF, ZSTU&#8208;30, create unique supramolecular interlocking sites that strongly bind CO2 while mitigating interactions with C2H4 and C2H2. Consequently, ZSTU&#8208;30 enables the direct production of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt; 99.9%) from a ternary gas mixture in a single step, with an exceptional C2H4 productivity of 3.18&#160;mmol g&#8722;1. The CO2&#8211;host interaction mechanism is elucidated by in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, which reveal multiple supramolecular interactions at the adsorption sites. Combining excellent water and pH stability, ZSTU&#8208;30 stands out as a robust and promising physisorbent for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification.

         <title>Contact Electrification via Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel molecular design strategy to perform electronic charge transfer during contact electrification by functionalizing surfaces with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. To elucidate and quantify the underlying molecular&#8208;level electron transfer processes, we combine X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical analysis, density functional theory calculations, and an atomic force microscopy&#8208;based contact electrification assay. 








Abstract
Contact electrification, as the transfer of charge upon the contact of two (dis)similar materials, is strongly influenced by surface chemistry, which governs the efficiency of charge separation. For harvesting electrical energy from mechanical energy, material pairs with high electron&#8208;transfer efficiency are essential. Here, we introduce a strategy to use electronic charge transfer in contact electrification via surface functionalization with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. Specifically, we functionalize Au(111) surfaces with mercaptomethyl&#8208;terminated redox&#8208;active molecules, namely triphenylamine and tetrathiafulvalene as donors and 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane as an acceptor, achieving stable and covalent immobilization, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical characterization, and density functional theory calculations, and enabling molecular&#8208;level electron&#8208;transfer. To quantify charge transfer at the micrometer scale, we introduce a contact electrification assay combining atomic force microscopy&#8208;based force spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. This approach allows for a precise measurement of charge transfer between Au(111) surfaces functionalized with redox&#8208;active molecules, revealing an electron&#8208;driven mechanism capable of achieving surface charge densities of (120&#160;&#177;&#160;17)&#160;&#181;C m&#8722;2. Our findings deepen the fundamental understanding of contact electrification by demonstrating that electron transfer&#8212;depending on the choice of materials&#8212;can indeed be its origin, and pave the way for the development of more efficient triboelectric devices.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation of Strong Aliphatic C&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired iron catalysis enables selective C(sp3)&#9472;H alkynylation via high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates, circumventing oxygen rebound to unlock direct functionalization of aliphatic feedstocks, natural products, and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
The development of synthetic catalysts capable of replicating cytochrome P450's remarkable C&#9472;H activation proficiency while suppressing oxygen rebound presents a fundamental challenge in catalysis, yet holds transformative potential for alkane functionalizations. Herein, we report an iron/EtBCMOM (L&#8208;cystine&#8208;based ligand) catalytic system for the selective distal methylene C(sp3)&#8208;H alkynylation of alkanes using alkynyl sulfones. This catalytic paradigm establishes a robust platform for the direct transformation of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds into versatile alkyne functionalities, exhibiting exceptional predictability in regioselectivity and accommodating an expansive substrate scope (&gt;60 structurally diverse examples). The technology unlocks previously inaccessible chemical space, enabling single&#8208;step derivatization of natural products, medicinally relevant molecules, and commodity feedstocks at traditionally unreactive positions.

         <title>Alkenylthianthrenium Salts as Synthetic Equivalents of (Cyclo)alkynes in Azide Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenylthianthrenium salts react as dipolarophiles and serve as synthetic equivalents of strained cycloalkynes, enabling efficient access to diverse 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles upon cycloaddition&#8211;elimination with azides. This strategy bypasses unstable cycloalkyne intermediates and provides a platform for fused&#8208;ring heterocycles and triazolium&#8208;functional polymers from simple alkene precursors.








Abstract
Cycloalkynes are highly reactive coupling partners in a variety of cycloaddition manifolds, but the synthetic utility of cycloalkynes with fewer than 8 atoms is limited by their fleeting stability. To expand access to heterocycles derived from formal cycloadditions to cycloalkynes, we have developed a methodology in which alkenylthianthrenium salts are used as synthetic equivalents of cycloalkynes in reactions with azides. This methodology enables expedient access to a variety of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from alkene building blocks in two steps, including triazoles fused with 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 8&#8208;membered carbocycles. Rather than serving as precursors to in situ&#8208;generated alkynes, we discovered that many alkenylsulfonium salts react with azides as dipolarophiles, generating 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via a distinct cycloaddition&#8211;elimination mechanism. We show that this methodology is viable for both acyclic and cyclic alkenylsulfonium salts and demonstrate its applications as a tool for the synthesis of new small molecule heterocycles and functional polymeric materials.

Rather than serving as precursors to in situ-generated alkynes, we discovered that many alkenylsulfonium salts react with azides as dipolarophiles, generating 1,2,3-triazoles via a distinct cycloaddition&#8211;elimination mechanism. We show that this methodology is viable for both acyclic and cyclic alkenylsulfonium salts and demonstrate its applications as a tool for the synthesis of new small molecule heterocycles and functional polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Schiff&#8208;Base Nickel Complexes as Cathode Interlayers for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes Ni&#8208;Me, Ni&#8208;iPr, and Ni&#8208;tBu were designed and synthesized as CILs through two steps with an overall yield up to 73%, with a low cost of 0.76 $ g&#8722;1, lower than PDINN of 1.56 $ g&#8722;1. When Ni&#8208;Me was employed as CIL achieved a high PCE of 19.11% in PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs, which is higher than PDINN (18.52%) and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (18.5%), and Ni&#8208;Me showed excellent universality (19.06% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 19.62% for D18:L8&#8208;BO).








Abstract
Efficient cathode interlayers (CILs) materials are crucial for high performance bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs). Herein, we report three excellent and low&#8208;cost CILs Ni&#8208;Me, Ni&#8208;iPr, and Ni&#8208;tBu based on Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes for the first time. The target molecules are obtained by highly efficient reactions and simple purification methods, affording a high overall yield of over 73%. These CILs show great work function tuning capability and film&#8208;forming property. Among them, Ni&#8208;Me demonstrates the highest electron conductivity (6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (5.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1), surpassing those of the widely used high&#8208;performance CILs PDINN (5.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, 1.76&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1), and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (3.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1, 2.64&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1). Grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicate that Ni&#8208;Me has higher crystallinity than Ni&#8208;iPr and Ni&#8208;tBu. When employed as the CIL in PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs, Ni&#8208;Me delivers a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.11%, outperforming PDINN (18.52%) and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (18.5%). The Ni&#8208;Me CIL also shows excellent universality (19.06% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 19.62% for D18:L8&#8208;BO). This work demonstrates that Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes have great potential as CILs in OSCs.

         <title>Giant Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Scaffolded Porphyrins as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates were synthesized from the iodinated CPP precursors. These conjugates exhibit high photocatalytic performance in the cycloaddition of tertiary anilines with maleimides, achieving high yields and broad substrate scope. Their superior activity over benchmark catalysts stems from the unique 3D CPP scaffold that suppresses &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and promotes efficient generation of 1O2/O2&#183;&#8722; via loose packing of porphyrin units.








Abstract
The efficient synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) with the designated functional groups still remains challenging. Meanwhile, the applications of functional CPPs have received increasing attention. In this paper, we first present a staged macrocyclization and TMS&#8208;I exchange strategy for the precise synthesis of [12]CPP&#8208;8I, while a direct three&#8208;fold macrocyclization of a diiodo&#8208;terphenyl precursor yields [9]CPP&#8208;6I in 39% yield. These results not only provide reliable routes to iodinated CPPs, but also reveal the influence of ring size on their chemical reactivity. Second, we further synthesized the giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates [12]CPP&#8208;8tBu3TPP and [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP from the respective iodinated precursors via Suzuki coupling with the porphyrin boronic ester. The unique 3D structure of the CPP scaffold can weaken intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favor the intermolecular loose packing of porphyrin units, ushering in generating 1O2 and O2&#183;&#8722; with high efficiency under light irradiation in DMF. Third, the giant porphyrin&#8208;CPP conjugates, in particular [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP, were demonstrated to be efficient photocatalysts for the photochemical reaction between tertiary aniline and maleimide with high yield and wide substrate scope, significantly outperforming porphyrins and other benchmark catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, the utility of [9]CPP&#8208;6tBu3TPP as the photocatalyst for developing photoinduced polymerization was explored.

Symmetric *CO&#9472;*CO coupling hinders CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion. We report a Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst where Pd atoms induce site differentiation on the Cu surface, creating two distinct sites. Pd&#8208;proximal sites promote *CO to *CHO protonation via H2O dissociation, while Pd&#8208;distal sites stabilize *CO. This strategy unlocks a highly efficient asymmetric CO&#9472;CHO coupling pathway, delivering a Faradiac efficiency of 78.8% (&#177;2.5%) for C2H4.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene (C2H4) presents a pivotal strategy for industrial decarbonization and carbon valorization but is persistently hindered by the intrinsic high kinetic barrier for symmetric *CO&#9472;*CO coupling on conventional Cu catalysts. To surmount this fundamental challenge, we synthesized a tandem Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst that achieves site differentiation of the surface Cu. The Pd1 atom induces electronic heterogeneity by creating two electronically distinct Cu sites. The Pd&#8208;proximal sites promote *CO protonation to *CHO by leveraging Pd assisted H2O dissociation, and Pd&#8208;distal sites stabilize *CO. This synergistic division unlocks a highly efficient asymmetric C&#9472;CHO coupling pathway. Operando spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirm that the engineered pathway lowers the critical C&#9472;C coupling barrier by &#8764;50%. The Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst delivers a peak C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.8% (&#177;2.5%) with a partial current density of 441&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;0.97&#160;V versus RHE in a flow cell, while maintaining excellent operational stability. This work validates asymmetric CO&#9472;CHO coupling as a superior route for C2H4 electrosynthesis by introducing a generalizable design paradigm of precisely steering reaction pathways on multi&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts.

A computational approach integrating quantum chemistry and machine learning enables the prediction of CO2&#8211;adduct stability. Model interpretability and experimental validation highlight its utility for designing base&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H carboxylation reactions.








Abstract
Base&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H carboxylation is a versatile pathway for utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a C1 building block in organic synthesis. However, CO2 constitutes a notorious thermodynamic sink, which restricts this approach to activated or intrinsically reactive nucleophiles. To qualitatively assess the stability of CO2 adducts, we present a computational approach that integrates quantum chemistry with statistical modeling to build a predictive workflow. The target property is the CO2 affinity, specifically the negative Gibbs free reaction energy. This predictive workflow has been applied to 60 novel carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles, suggesting reactions that yield stable carboxylation adducts. The results have been validated through experimental methods for five carbanions, which include three stable and two unstable adducts in DMSO according to our predictions. In addition, we examined two further carbanions that were suggested to form stable CO2 adducts in DMSO, to further assess the experimental protocol and broaden its scope to structurally distinct motifs.

         <title>Harnessing Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN): Responsive Chemical Tools for Delivering an Emerging Gasotransmitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCN is an important biological mediator, joining NO, CO, and H2S as a regulatory gasotransmitter. This report outlines the design, development, and application of responsive, activatable, and tunable HCN donors. In&#8208;solution kinetics and selectivity data, as well as demonstration of HCN delivery in live cell environments, support the effectiveness of this broad approach for the delivery of HCN in biological environments.








Abstract
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an emerging gasotransmitter, joining NO, CO, and H2S in a group of important endogenous signaling and regulatory molecules. Despite this importance, synthetic HCN donors that respond to broadly tunable stimuli remain absent. Here, I report a platform approach for developing synthetic HCN donors that can be tuned to release HCN on demand in response to endogenous stimuli. The reported donors are stable in solution until activated by a specific stimulus, in this case esterases, after which they release a caged cyanohydrin that is spontaneously hydrolyzed in water to generate HCN. This approach is also compatible with responsive self&#8208;immolative 1,6&#8208;elimination platforms, allowing for significant modification of release rates, while providing a general, modular, and tunable platform for HCN delivery in response to specific stimuli. Moreover, the developed donors are shown to release HCN in live cells, thereby significantly advancing the available approaches for HCN delivery in complex environments.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Twin abeo&#8208;Steroids Bufogargarizins A and B via a Divergent Intramolecular Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twin natural products. This manuscript describes a concise biomimetic synthesis of twin abeo&#8208;steroids bufogargarizins A and B with an unusual [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons in 19 steps (LLS). The described synthetic approach features the application of a bioinspired regiodivergent intramolecular aldol addition reaction and a selective singlet oxygen&#8208;based oxidation followed by an endoperoxide transposition to streamline the installation of the D&#8208;ring oxidation, which has enabled the concise synthesis of bufogargarizins A and B.








Abstract
This manuscript describes a concise bioinspired synthesis of twin abeo&#8208;steroids bufogargarizins A and B with an unusual [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons and a highly oxidized D&#8208;ring with an &#945;&#8208;pyrone substituent from (+)&#8208;methyl estrone. The described synthetic approach features ozonolytic cleavage of the &#916;5,10&#8208;alkene of an easily available estrone derivative, followed by a bioinspired regio&#8208; and stereoselective intramolecular aldol addition reaction that produced the desired bufogargarizins A and B precursors with the [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons in 27% and 63% yields, correspondingly. This work provides direct evidence that proves the biosynthetic hypothesis for the first time, as prior synthetic studies suggest that only bufogargarizin B could be formed via an intramolecular aldol reaction. The subsequent installation of the &#946;17&#8208;pyrone moiety along with the &#946;14, &#946;15&#8208;epoxide and &#946;16&#8208;acetoxy group was found to be challenging due to the instability of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone moiety to a range of basic, reductive, and oxidative conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a singlet oxygen&#8208;based oxidation method that results in a streamlined installation of the D&#8208;ring oxidation and stereochemistry from a &#916;14,16&#8208;diene precursor. This enabled the completion of the syntheses of bufogargarizins A and B in 19 steps (LLS) and 0.36 and 1.5% overall yields, respectively.

         <title>Benchmark C2H4/C3H6 Separation in MOF&#8211;COF Bilayer Membranes via Interfacial Coordination Induced Sub&#8208;Angstrom Channel Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial coordination induced sub&#8208;angstrom channel regulation strategy is developed where the abundant ionic groups in iCOF coordinate with ZIF&#8208;8 lattice, causing lattice contraction of ZIF&#8208;8 and shifting the molecular cut&#8208;off from 4.8 to 4.4&#160;&#197;. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;iCOF membrane exhibited record&#8208;high C2H4/C3H6 separation performance with C2H4 permeance of 405 GPU and C2H4/C3H6 selectivity of 45.








Abstract
Olefins including ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6) are pivotal raw materials in the chemical industry, and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) process provides a sustainable strategy to replace conventional petroleum&#8208;based methods for the olefin production. The purification of olefin mixture is an essential part in the MTO process where membrane technology has emerged as a high&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving approach. However, it remains a critical challenge to achieve precise sieving of C2H4 and C3H6 due to their similar molecular size. Herein, we report an interfacial coordination induced sub&#8208;angstrom channel regulation strategy and achieve unprecedented cut&#8208;off shift of ZIF&#8208;8 from C3H6/C3H8 to C2H4/C3H6. Ionic covalent organic framework with crystalline structure and high&#8208;density sulfonate groups was used as growth template for ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. The coordination between sulfonate groups and Zn2+ ions induced lattice contraction of ZIF&#8208;8 framework, which is confirmed by XRD patterns and molecular dynamic simulations. The resulting membranes demonstrate a distinct cut&#8208;off between C2H4 and C3H6, achieving a C2H4 permeance of 405 GPU and an exceptional C2H4/C3H6 selectivity of 45, surpassing the separation performance of all reported membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the excellent scalability of this strategy by fabricating large area flat sheet membrane (&gt;500&#160;cm2) on polymer substrates.

         <title>Boosting Reversible Photocontrol of a Photoxenase by an Engineered Conformational Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocontrol of enzymes with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids hitherto yielded only limited light&#8208;regulation factors (LRFs). Here we boosted the LRF of an imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase variant from &#8764;15 to &#8764;100 in a semi&#8208;rational design approach and unraveled the mechanistic fundamentals of this effect via biophysical and computational analyses, highlighting the potential and providing guidelines for this photocontrol approach. 








Abstract
Our study successfully explores strategies to effectively improve the photocontrol efficiency of light&#8208;sensitive enzymes, dubbed photoxenases, with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (UAAs). The engineering of photoxenases is a versatile method for the reversible photocontrol in various applications. To boost the photocontrol of an established allosteric and heterodimeric photoxenase based on imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, we turned from an ineffective tuning of the UAA photochemistry to a semi&#8208;rational enzyme design. Remarkably, mutations at the catalytically important heterodimer interface increased the light&#8208;regulation factor (LRF) for the kcat up to &#8764;100 with near&#8208;quantitative reversibility. Steady&#8208;state kinetic investigations combined with computationally determined correlation&#8208;based Shortest&#8208;Path&#8208;Map (SPM) analysis and conformational landscapes revealed how photocontrol was altered in the two best hits. The LRF(kcat) correlated with a shift of a conformational equilibrium between an active and inactive population at the targeted active site and a tuned population productivity upon irradiation. While the overall reduced kcat values originated from a rewiring of the allosteric signal transmission, the increased LRF(kcat) resulted from a change in i) the size of the conformational shift, ii) the population productivity, and iii) the conformational heterogeneity. With this, our findings provide initial guidelines to boost photocontrol and underscore the power of photoxenase engineering.

Here we boosted the LRF of an imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase variant from &#8764;15 to &#8764;100 in a semi-rational design approach and unraveled the mechanistic fundamentals of this effect via biophysical and computational analyses, highlighting the potential and providing guidelines for this photocontrol approach. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study successfully explores strategies to effectively improve the photocontrol efficiency of light-sensitive enzymes, dubbed photoxenases, with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (UAAs). The engineering of photoxenases is a versatile method for the reversible photocontrol in various applications. To boost the photocontrol of an established allosteric and heterodimeric photoxenase based on imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, we turned from an ineffective tuning of the UAA photochemistry to a semi-rational enzyme design. Remarkably, mutations at the catalytically important heterodimer interface increased the light-regulation factor (LRF) for the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; up to &#8764;100 with near-quantitative reversibility. Steady-state kinetic investigations combined with computationally determined correlation-based Shortest-Path-Map (SPM) analysis and conformational landscapes revealed how photocontrol was altered in the two best hits. The LRF(&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;) correlated with a shift of a conformational equilibrium between an active and inactive population at the targeted active site and a tuned population productivity upon irradiation. While the overall reduced &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; values originated from a rewiring of the allosteric signal transmission, the increased LRF(&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted from a change in i) the size of the conformational shift, ii) the population productivity, and iii) the conformational heterogeneity. With this, our findings provide initial guidelines to boost photocontrol and underscore the power of photoxenase engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Resolution in EPR Spectroscopy Using para&#8208;Hydrogen Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the advantageous properties of solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by investigating the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical. The spectral resolution of the P&#8208;centered radical in p&#8208;H2 is roughly enhanced by a factor of three compared to argon.








Abstract
We developed a matrix isolation experiment utilizing a closed&#8208;cycle helium cryostat, which operates at 2.5&#160;K and enables electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements in solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices. The EPR spectra of the persistent 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical were recorded at 2.5&#160;K in p&#8208;H2. The spectrum of TEMPO in p&#8208;H2 shows a narrower linewidth compared to argon, and its matrix&#8208;isolated spectrum and simulation are reported. The P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical was generated in p&#8208;H2 via in situ photolysis of the corresponding phosphorus iodide, which affords roughly a three&#8208;fold increase in spectral resolution compared to argon, as well as higher sensitivity due to the non&#8208;existing cage effect in soft p&#8208;H2.

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Alcohol Generation in Bipolar Membrane CO Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a forward&#8208;biased bipolar membrane (FB&#8208;BPM) CO electrolyzer that reduces liquid product crossover to&#160;&lt;10% (8x lower than conventional designs) while minimizing hydrogen production and in favor of multicarbon liquid species. By engineering catalyst morphology to modulate the binding of *CO, *H, and *OH intermediates, we identified a CuSn catalyst enhancing C2&#8211;C1 coupling pathways for alcohols formation. Integrating the reactor design with catalyst innovation, we achieve&#160;&gt;15 wt% alcohols production directly from the cathodic outlet.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide offers an electricity&#8208;powered route to make multicarbon liquid products. However, in conventional systems employing anion exchange membranes (AEMs), significant liquid product crossover leads to dilute product streams, increasing separation costs; and also produces unwanted anodic oxidation, further decreasing overall efficiency. Here, we report a forward&#8208;biased bipolar membrane (FB&#8208;BPM) system that achieves&#160;&lt;10% liquid product crossover while sustaining a highly alkaline environment near the cathode, suppressing ethylene and hydrogen and favoring liquid products. By tuning catalyst composition to modulate the adsorption of *H and *OH, we steer selectivity toward acetate and alcohols. Using the FB&#8208;BPM system, we achieve&#160;&gt;25 wt% acetate on CuZn and&#160;&gt;15 wt% alcohols on CuSn directly from the cathode outlet stream.

         <title>Microcondensate&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Infusion of mRNA Across the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delivery of mRNA without lipid nanoparticles remains challenging. FcB(L17E)3&#8208;driven microcondensates with nucleic acids, aided by short ssDNA, enable coacervate formation, actin&#8208;dependent cytosolic infusion, and in vivo protein expression, offering a potential platform for next&#8208;generation mRNA therapeutics and vaccination.








Abstract
This study presents a strategy for developing micrometer&#8208;sized coacervates comprised of cationic intracellular delivery peptide FcB(L17E)3 and nucleic acids (termed &#8220;microcondensates&#8221;) as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;free platform for intracellular messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This approach is based on our previous finding that FcB(L17E)3 forms a microcondensate through interactions with IgG labeled with a negatively charged fluorescent dye. Similarly, the negative charge of nucleic acids causes siRNAs to form microcondensates with FcB(L17E)3, resulting in the facile infusion of the siRNAs through the plasma membrane with 40% gene knockdown efficiency. mRNAs form aggregates with FcB(L17E)3 due to their longer chains, which prevents efficient delivery. Remarkably, adding short single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) to mRNA enables microcondensate formation with FcB(L17E)3, facilitating protein expression. Additionally, this microcondensate system successfully facilitated the intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) by optimizing the charge ratio between FcB(L17E)3 and nucleic acids. Finally, the subcutaneous injection of microcondensates into mice successfully induced protein expression in vivo. The achievement of in vivo mRNA delivery and protein expression using microcondensates may offer a strategy for nucleic acid delivery with potential applicability in cancer immunotherapy and mRNA&#8208;based vaccination.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrosynthesis of Glycine from Glyoxylic Acid and Nitrate via Stabilizing the NH2OH Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH2OH and promoting the key C&#8211;N coupling process from *NH2OH and GOA yet suppressing the generation of the by&#8208;products on CuSn alloys catalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling reactions have emerged as an important strategy for synthesizing value&#8208;added organic compounds under ambient environment, among which glycine is of practical importance for various biological activities and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, such synthesis suffers from limited selectivity due to the complex reaction pathways. In this study, we report the highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH2OH and optimizing the absorption of glyoxylic acid on copper&#8208;based model catalysts. Theoretical calculations and operando measurements indicate that CuSn alloys promote the generation of NH2OH and optimize the absorption of glyoxylic acid, thereby facilitating the precise coupling of C&#8211;N groups to synthesize glycine. Consequently, the CuSn electrocatalyst delivers an excellent performance for the co&#8208;reduction to generate glycine with a maximum Faradaic efficiency and selectivity of 78.69% and 99.32%, respectively. Moreover, the CuSn catalyst enables the production of 0.73&#160;g of glycine with a conversion rate of 100%, respectively, in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that the total cost for the proposed method is 1158.88 $ ton&#8722;1, 1.78&#8208;fold lower than the commercial price (2060.44 $ ton&#8722;1), suggesting that the electrosynthesis of glycine in our system is a feasible and profitable route.

&lt;p&gt;Highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co-reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and promoting the key C&#8211;N coupling process from *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and GOA yet suppressing the generation of the by-products on CuSn alloys catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling reactions have emerged as an important strategy for synthesizing value-added organic compounds under ambient environment, among which glycine is of practical importance for various biological activities and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, such synthesis suffers from limited selectivity due to the complex reaction pathways. In this study, we report the highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co-reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and optimizing the absorption of glyoxylic acid on copper-based model catalysts. Theoretical calculations and operando measurements indicate that CuSn alloys promote the generation of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and optimize the absorption of glyoxylic acid, thereby facilitating the precise coupling of C&#8211;N groups to synthesize glycine. Consequently, the CuSn electrocatalyst delivers an excellent performance for the co-reduction to generate glycine with a maximum Faradaic efficiency and selectivity of 78.69% and 99.32%, respectively. Moreover, the CuSn catalyst enables the production of 0.73&#160;g of glycine with a conversion rate of 100%, respectively, in large-scale synthesis. Techno-economic analysis reveals that the total cost for the proposed method is 1158.88 $ ton&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.78-fold lower than the commercial price (2060.44 $ ton&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), suggesting that the electrosynthesis of glycine in our system is a feasible and profitable route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in Bi&#8208;Layered Vanadium Oxides for Zinc Batteries by Nanoconfinement Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of regulating solvent co&#8208;intercalation by electrode nanoconfinement design is demonstrated. Through decreasing interlayer hydration and introducing organic molecules with reduced lone electron&#8208;pair density, the interlayer solvo&#8208;philicity of bi&#8208;layered vanadium oxides is tuned. As a result, progressively reduced hydration of intercalating Zn2+ can be achieved, thereby tuning the electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Electrochemical intercalation typically involves ion desolvation at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface, incurring kinetic limitations and strong ion&#8208;host interactions. The emerging mechanism of solvent co&#8208;intercalation, where ions intercalate together with a (partially) intact solvation shell, can mitigate these drawbacks, but has thus far been primarily explored from the viewpoint of electrolyte design. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of regulating solvent co&#8208;intercalation by electrode nanoconfinement design. Through the combined effects of decreasing interlayer water of bi&#8208;layered vanadium oxides and introducing molecules that tune the nanoconfining interlayer environment from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, the Zn2+ intercalation properties in aqueous electrolyte are modified. Comprehensive experiments and simulations reveal progressively reduced solvation/hydration of intercalating Zn2+ with decreasing interlayer hydrophilicity, affecting maximum capacity, redox potential, and kinetics of the electrochemical intercalation reactions. Similar electrochemical trends are observed in nonaqueous electrolytes, indicating the potential of nanoconfinement design as a universal strategy for regulating ion&#8208;solvent (co&#8208;)intercalation in various battery chemistries.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Engineered Interfacial Water Modulation on Single&#8208;Atom Cu Sites for Enhanced Dilute Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of O&#8208;engineered Cu&#8208;NCOx SACs featuring asymmetric Cu&#8208;N3O1 and oxygen functionalities for dilute NO3RR. Introducing Cu&#9472;O coordination results in electron&#8208;deficient Cu, beneficial for NO3&#8722; adsorption. While the nucleophilic oxygen functionalities trap Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O being close to the electrode, ensuring the *H supply. The synergistic effects of Cu&#9472;N3O1 and oxygen functionalities collectively lead to superior NO3RR to Cu&#8211;N4 catalyst.








Abstract
The efficiency of nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is highly dependent on the complex interfacial microenvironment, where the triumvirate of alkali metal cations, water network, and NO3&#8722; adsorption dynamics collectively dictate reaction activity and selectivity. However, how the structural engineering of catalyst governing the interfacial microenvironment is still unclear, yet critical for the construction of efficient catalytic system. In this work, we develop a series of oxygen&#8208;engineered Cu&#8211;NCOx SACs featuring asymmetric Cu&#9472;N3O1 active site with tunable oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups that enable highly efficient NO3RR in dilute nitrate concentrations (100&#160;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8211;N). Experimental and theoretical results show that the introduction of Cu&#9472;O coordination results in the pronounced electron&#8208;deficient Cu site, which is beneficial for NO3&#8722; adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the electron&#8208;rich nucleophilic oxygen functionalities specifically O = C&#9472;O and C = O can efficiently trap Na&#8314;&#8208;hydrated water (Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O) being close to the electrode through electrostatic interactions. The NO3RR performance follows a distinct volcano relationship with interfacial Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O concentration due to the enhanced HER with large localized *H enrichment. As a result, the Cu&#8211;NCOM electrocatalyst possessing optimal oxygen incorporation exhibits an exceptional NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.7% with an outstanding NH3 yield rate of 10.5&#160;mol h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1. This research provides an effective O&#8208;incorporation strategy to boost NO3RR performance in dilute NO3&#8722; aqueous solution by precisely controlling the interfacial water structure around asymmetric Cu SACs centers.

         <title>Recyclable Turing&#8208;Structured Polymer Electrolytes for Sustainable Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable Turing&#8208;structured polymer electrolytes (TPEs) were prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The Turing structure provides periodic Li ion&#8208;enriching microdomains that assemble shortened, ordered pathways into 3D percolating ion&#8208;conduction network. TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid&#8208;state batteries, alongside excellent self&#8208;healing, flame&#8208;retardant, and recyclable properties.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) face critical limitations in ionic conductivity, ion transference numbers, and recyclability. We report a recyclable Turing&#8208;structured polymer electrolyte (TPE) prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The Turing structure provides fast ion&#8208;conduction surfaces/channels with periodic lithium (Li)&#8208;ion (Li+) self&#8208;concentration domains to enable a 3D percolating Li+ conduction, reducing migration barriers to achieve a high Li+ conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and transference number (0.61). TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid&#8208;state batteries at low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), alongside excellent self&#8208;healing, flame&#8208;retardant, and recyclable properties. Closed&#8208;loop recycling recovers 86.5% of polymer precursors and 82.6% of costly Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt, with regenerated electrolytes retaining their initial performance. These results highlight the potential of Turing structure as a scalable design paradigm for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage and conversion systems.

         <title>About a Trillion Times More Acidic than Expected? On the Difference Between the Hammett H0 and the Unified pH Acidity of Sulfuric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take off the Glasses! Indicator bases are tools for determining the widely used Hammett H0 acidity, which was used to look at pure sulfuric acid. Yet, this is like looking through sunglasses: despite their usefulness, they work as a filter. We take off the glasses and see unfiltered the protochemical pH acidity measured with the H2 electrode: the acidity of pure sulfuric acid is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than the indicator glasses show.








Abstract
We report on the considerable difference between the distinct pH and Hammett's H0 acidity function&#160;in the entire H2O&#8208;H2SO4 mixing range. The Hammett acidity for 100&#160;wt% H2SO4 is accepted with H0 = &#8722;11.9. We measured the pH acidity using two different electrochemical cells, operating with at least one hydrogen electrode, giving for 100% sulfuric acid pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ as&#160;&#8722;24&#160;&#177;&#160;2. This value was confirmed by high&#8208;level compound calculations using the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) level at the basis set limit and COSMO&#8208;RS solvation. Thus, the difference between both scales amounts to pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ &#8722; H0 = &#8722;12 or 12 orders of magnitude. It results from the Gibbs transfer energies of the (protonated) Hammett&#8208;indicator bases B (BH+) used to define and determine H0. High&#8208;level computations of these Gibbs transfer energies confirm our experimental as well as our computational findings. A general method to convert H0 values of acids other than sulfuric acid into pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ values is given. Hence, this huge (pH&#160;&#8722;&#160;H0)&#8208;difference clearly delineates that the often used but erroneous assumption of the H0 values constituting an extension of pH acidity to the realm of negative pH values is wrong. The distinctive protochemical potential curve progression is discussed as a function of sulfuric acid concentration and physical properties, together with the assignment of the potential&#8208;determining species in the respective mixtures. Finally, superacidity is defined in a universal manner, i.e., applicable to all media, i.e., liquid, solid, or gaseous.

     alt="About a Trillion Times More Acidic than Expected? On the Difference Between the Hammett H0 and the Unified pH Acidity of Sulfuric Acid"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take off the Glasses!&lt;/b&gt; Indicator bases are tools for determining the widely used Hammett &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; acidity, which was used to look at pure sulfuric acid. Yet, this is like looking through sunglasses: despite their usefulness, they work as a filter. We take off the glasses and see unfiltered the protochemical pH acidity measured with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode: the acidity of pure sulfuric acid is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than the indicator glasses show.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the considerable difference between the distinct pH and Hammett's &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; acidity function&#160;in the entire H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixing range. The Hammett acidity for 100&#160;wt% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is accepted with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;11.9. We measured the pH acidity using two different electrochemical cells, operating with at least one hydrogen electrode, giving for 100% sulfuric acid pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ as&#160;&#8722;24&#160;&#177;&#160;2. This value was confirmed by high-level compound calculations using the DLPNO-CCSD(T) level at the basis set limit and COSMO-RS solvation. Thus, the difference between both scales amounts to pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ &#8722; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;12 or 12 orders of magnitude. It results from the Gibbs transfer energies of the (protonated) Hammett-indicator bases B (BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) used to define and determine &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. High-level computations of these Gibbs transfer energies confirm our experimental as well as our computational findings. A general method to convert &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values of acids other than sulfuric acid into pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ values is given. Hence, this huge (pH&#160;&#8722;&#160;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)-difference clearly delineates that the often used but erroneous assumption of the &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values constituting an extension of pH acidity to the realm of negative pH values is wrong. The distinctive protochemical potential curve progression is discussed as a function of sulfuric acid concentration and physical properties, together with the assignment of the potential-determining species in the respective mixtures. Finally, superacidity is defined in a universal manner, i.e., applicable to all media, i.e., liquid, solid, or gaseous.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binaphthalene&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Scorpionate Zinc Catalysts for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Bio&#8208;Based &#947;&#8208;Ketolactones to High&#8208;Molar&#8208;Mass Degradable Polyesters</title>

         <dc:description>
We developed binaphthalene&#8208;modified C&#8208;scorpionate zinc catalysts with high activity and stability, enabling efficient, controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;derived &#947;&#8208;ketolactones to produce high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polyesters (Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;800&#160;kDa) with excellent mechanical performance and photodegradability. This system also prevents catalyst aggregation and achieves precise chain&#8208;length control even at low catalyst loadings.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic (di)esters is a key strategy for producing sustainable polyesters, yet the development of robust, efficient, and tunable catalysts remains a major challenge. Herein, we reported a series of zinc catalysts supported by poly(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane (C&#8208;scorpionate) ligands for the controlled ROP of 4,4,6,7&#8208;tetramethyloxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (MeOPD), a bio&#8208;derived &#947;&#8208;ketolactone obtained from ketoisophorone. Ligand framework optimization afforded a highly active and stable binaphthalene&#8208;containing zinc complex, enabling the synthesis of degradable polyesters with absolute Mw&#160;&gt;&#160;900&#160;kDa and Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;800&#160;kDa. Mechanistic studies revealed that steric and electronic features of the ligand suppress catalyst aggregation and stabilize the Zn&#9472;OR species. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited remarkable tolerance to excess alcohols, allowing for precise molar mass control even at low catalyst loadings while maintaining polymerization efficiency. Tensile testing confirmed improved mechanical properties of the resulting polyesters with increasing molar mass, while photodegradation studies demonstrated efficient UV&#8208;triggered degradation enabled by backbone ketone functionalities. These findings offer important insights into catalyst design for next&#8208;generation sustainable polymers.

         <title>Bright Cyan Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Efficient Second Harmonic Generation in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Silver&#8208;Based Halides with Achiral Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantiomeric pair of zero&#8208;dimensional chiral silver halides, P/M&#8208;(MTP)2AgI3, with intrinsic chirality was constructed using achiral MTP+ cations and triangular&#8208;planar [AgI3]2&#8722; units. Through intentional copper doping, the PLQY was enhanced from 0.8% to near unity, accompanied by bright cyan circularly polarized luminescence and efficient second harmonic generation.








Abstract
Chiral metal halides featuring circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have drawn considerable attention due to their promising applications in imaging, sensing, and photonics. However, such materials largely rely on chiral organic cations, and technically significant cyan CPL remains out of reach. Here, we report an enantiomeric pair of zero&#8208;dimensional chiral silver halides, P/M&#8208;(MTP)2AgI3 (MTP&#160;=&#160;methyltriphenylphosphonium), constructed from achiral MTP+ cations and distorted triangular&#8208;planar [AgI3]2&#8722; units. Further intentional doping with copper(I) ions not only suppresses nonradiative recombination but also introduces additional emissive centers, leading to photoluminescence quantum yield enhanced from 0.8% to near unity and enabling bright cyan CPL with a large dissymmetry factor glum of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Moreover, the intrinsic non&#8208;centrosymmetry of this material enables efficient second harmonic generation, together with a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 52.6&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2. This study offers new insights into the design of chiral metal halides with rich chiroptical and nonlinear optical effects.

Carbon Insertion: An unprecedented visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ring expansion of cyclic oximes through a photochemical aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement, mediated by energy transfer catalysis has been developed. This diradical&#8208;mediated photochemical rearrangement provides a mild and efficient synthetic route and expands the toolbox of radical&#8208;based ring expansions, complementing classical approaches such as the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction.








Abstract
Skeletal editing has emerged as a transformative strategy for manipulating cyclic architectures, with radical&#8208;based approaches providing particularly mild and versatile routes. While significant progress has been made, molecular editing via diradical intermediates under visible&#8208;light irradiation remains rare. Herein, we report an unprecedented visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ring expansion of cyclic oximes through a photochemical aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement, mediated by energy transfer catalysis. This diradical&#8208;mediated photochemical rearrangement provides a mild and efficient synthetic route, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and versatile downstream reactivity of the rearranged scaffolds. The transformation can also be conducted under photochemical continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Mechanistic studies support a stepwise sequence involving triplet diradical formation, a challenging 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, &#946;&#8208;scission elimination, and diradical recombination. This method expands the toolbox of radical&#8208;based ring expansions, complementing classical approaches such as the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction.

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Derived from the Polyene Class of Antifungal Drugs Reveal Distinct Localization Patterns and Resistance&#8208;Associated Vacuolar Sequestration in Candida Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes derived from all three clinically used polyene antifungals (amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin) enabled direct visualization of distribution in yeast cells of various Candida species. While retaining the ergosterol&#8208;dependent mode of action of their parent drugs, the probes revealed distinct, structure&#8208;specific localization patterns and uncovered enhanced vacuolar sequestration in highly polyene&#8208;resistant strains.








Abstract
Amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin are the only polyene antifungals in clinical use and remain last&#8208;resort therapies for severe fungal infections. These agents disrupt fungal membranes through ergosterol binding, but how structural differences between the three polyenes influence subcellular distribution, and whether such distribution is linked to resistance, remains uncharacterized. To investigate these relationships, we developed fluorescent probes from each clinically used polyene by conjugating a common fluorophore to a conserved functional group, preserving the amphoteric nature and ergosterol&#8208;dependent antifungal activity of the parent drug while enabling live&#8208;cell imaging. This unified design allowed direct comparison of localization and trafficking across Candida species, including sterol biosynthesis mutants with a high level of polyene resistance. The probes revealed structure&#8208;specific distribution patterns, with resistant strains showing enhanced accumulation within the vacuole lumen for all three polyenes. These findings suggest that vacuolar sequestration contributes to polyene resistance and may represent an unrecognized aspect of the fungal stress response. More broadly, this work provides the first direct visual evidence that polyene structure dictates subcellular distribution patterns in fungal cells.

To investigate these relationships, we developed fluorescent probes from each clinically used polyene by conjugating a common fluorophore to a conserved functional group, preserving the amphoteric nature and ergosterol-dependent antifungal activity of the parent drug while enabling live-cell imaging. This unified design allowed direct comparison of localization and trafficking across &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species, including sterol biosynthesis mutants with a high level of polyene resistance. The probes revealed structure-specific distribution patterns, with resistant strains showing enhanced accumulation within the vacuole lumen for all three polyenes. These findings suggest that vacuolar sequestration contributes to polyene resistance and may represent an unrecognized aspect of the fungal stress response. More broadly, this work provides the first direct visual evidence that polyene structure dictates subcellular distribution patterns in fungal cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;Silicon Exchange of Aromatic Lactones via Decarbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;exchange strategy enables direct carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;silicon replacement in lactones. Scope evaluation and derivatization of the resulting silacycles demonstrate broad functional group compatibility and synthetic utility. This method is further applicable to late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, underscoring its potential for complex molecules modification.








Abstract
Sila substitution, the strategy of replacing a specific carbon atom in organic molecules with silicon has garnered significant interest for the development of new functional compounds. However, the synthesis of silicon analogs remains challenging and is typically achieved through de novo methods. A promising alternative is the direct replacement of a carbon atom with silicon at a later stage of molecular construction. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;silicon (CO&#8208;to&#8208;Si) atom swapping in lactones. Mechanistic studies reveal that the transformation proceeds via direct decarbonylation followed by silicon insertion. This method enables the efficient conversion of a broad range of lactones, including coumarins, isocoumarins, and dibenzopyranones, into their corresponding silacyclic analogs through decarbonylative silicon insertion. The resulting silacycles serve as versatile building blocks and undergo further derivatization. Notably, this strategy facilitates late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, providing a streamlined route to silicon&#8208;containing scaffolds from readily available lactones.

         <title>Physically Masked Nanoflares for Accurate Biological Applications by Blocking Nucleases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a porous nanocage constructed by polymer was used to trap the nanoflare for bio&#8208;application for the first time. Different from the traditional nanoflare, bulky nuclease was inhibited to traverse the nanocage but not for flexible nucleic acid target. Thus, high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence signal was acquired, and cancer cells can be differentiated from normal cells by fully avoiding the interference from nuclease.








Abstract
Nanoflare integrated with a gold nanoparticle (Au NP) core and a functional oligonucleotide shell is a powerful platform for bio&#8208;applications, such as sensing, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. However, degradation of nucleic acids by endogenous nucleases in vivo is an inevitable problem causing signal distortion. To solve this issue, in this work, a physically masked strategy was designed by trapping the nanoflare in a porous polymer nanocage. The porous structure of the nanocage allowed the penetration of small target molecules to react with the internal nanoflare, while bulky nucleases were blocked, resulting in high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence signaling. Using this method, cancer cells were differentiated from normal cells by a masked nanoflare that can recognize a microRNA biomarker (miRNA&#8208;21), and tumors were imaged with a high&#8208;contrast signal. The physical masking strategy opened up a new path for improving the stability of nucleic acid probes against nucleases, facilitating accurate bio&#8208;application.

         <title>Triply Responsive Control of Ion Transport with an Artificial Channel Creates a Switchable AND to OR Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a triply responsive artificial ion channel, showing tuneable activity, and responsive to three distinct stimuli &#8208; light, pH, and ligand &#8211; which we use to formulate an AND to OR switchable molecular logic gate.








Abstract
Ion channels are ubiquitous in Nature, performing complex and essential tasks in our bodies. Synthetic chemists have begun to understand how to form artificial channels, which hold great promise as components in artificial cells, and in synthetic biology more widely. Future generations of these systems will be critical in the treatment of channelopathies. Despite advances in synthetic ion transporters, the current generation cannot approach the selectivity and controllability of the biological ion channels they seek to emulate, and multimodal control over activity remains hard to achieve. Herein, we present a synthetic ion channel whose activity can be controlled by three orthogonal stimuli (light, pH, guest/ligand), based on a pillar[5]arene functionalized with photoswitchable ortho&#8208;tetrafluoroazobenzene moieties. We demonstrate excellent control over ten photoswitches (E&#8208;to&#8208;Z 82%, Z&#8208;to&#8208;E quant.). We show that the most active Z&#8208;isomer forms dimeric ion channels in membranes. Single molecule planar bilayer conductance studies show high and low conductance states dependent on irradiation wavelength. We demonstrate that this activity can be modulated over 170&#8208;fold by controlling pH, irradiation, and guest addition. We use these three stimuli to design a pH switchable AND to OR logic gate system, creating a powerful addition to the canon of synthetic ion channels.

         <title>Frame&#8208;Shifted Synthesis of Oligoheterocycles as a Platform for Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern chemistry seeks to turn the simple raw materials into complex molecules that matter in health, agriculture, and technology. Among these, oligoheterocycles stand out for their versatility, yet they are most often built by cross&#8208;coupling reactions that often rely on expensive metal catalysts. We outline a complementary path: an iterative construction platform that draws on high&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state carbon modules derived from commodity feedstocks. The bifunctional units we describe participate in condensation sequences and counterintuitively open routes to frameworks beyond the reach of traditional methods.








Abstract
Chemists continue to develop strategies that leverage abundant feedstocks to accelerate the production of medicines, agrochemicals, and materials. Oligoheterocycles are a broad class of molecules that span these disciplines. Cross&#8208;coupling strategies are commonly used to assemble oligoheterocycles; however, these methods can be challenging and often rely on precious metal catalysts and building blocks whose production entails significant environmental and economic costs. We present a strategy for the iterative construction of oligoheterocycles that leverages sustainable building blocks designed around high&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state carbon. By utilizing feedstocks from the base of the chemical supply chain, we generate bifunctional building blocks that chemoselectively engage with a variety of partners through simple condensation manifolds. This approach has enabled the creation of novel scaffolds previously inaccessible by conventional means, exemplifying sustainable design strategies.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Access to Chiral S(VI) Stereocenters by Kinetic Resolution of Sulfonimidoyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent approach for the kinetic resolution of S(VI) stereocenters that leverages the electrophilic reactivity of the chiral sulfur atom is described. The catalytic process provides access to sulfonimidoyl chlorides and sulfonimidates, which are among the least studied S(VI) functionalities. Mechanistic studies reveal key roles of substrate interactions with the unfunctionalized catalyst backbone in the enantioselective process.








Abstract
Sulfur chirality has recently gained in importance across a wide range of chemical domains. However, the dearth of catalytic approaches for sulfur(VI) stereocenters continues to present a challenge for the broader utilization of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur motifs. We report herein the development of a previously unexplored approach for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfur(VI) functionalities that leverages the electrophilic reactivity of sulfur(VI) stereocenters. This catalytic strategy provides enantioconvergent access to sulfonimidoyl chlorides and sulfonimidates, which are some of the least explored and catalytically accessible stereogenic S(VI) functionalities. This study also elucidates the key roles of noncovalent interactions and highlights the importance of the unfunctionalized backbone of the catalyst in imparting high enantioselectivity to the kinetic resolution of heteroatom stereocenters.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorus Radical Transformations for the Assembly of P&#8208;Stereogenic Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective copper&#8208;photoredox catalytic platform enables enantioselective generation of metal&#8208;bound P&#8208;centered radicals and their stereoretentive transformations within a precisely defined chiral environment. This strategy not only enables efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant P&#8208;chiral molecules but also provides mechanistic insights into heteroatom&#8208;centered asymmetric radical chemistry.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals hold transformative potential for organophosphorus synthesis, yet their configurational lability and distinctive reactivity profiles have historically restricted their application in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that enables the stereoselective generation of copper&#8208;bound P&#8208;centered radicals and their subequent stereoretentive transformations within a well&#8208;defined chiral environment. The synergistic approach achieves unprecedented kinetic resolutions of racemic H&#8208;phosphinates with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes or gem&#8208;difluorostyrenes, delivering 85 fluorine&#8208;containing P&#8208;chiral phosphinates with up to 98%&#160;ee. The method thereby bridges a synthetic gap for these previously inaccessible, pharmacologically significant compounds. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a stereochemical relay: enantiodiscriminatory binding of racemic substrates, photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) for radical generation, and stereoretentive bond formation. By reconciling radical reactivity with stereochemical fidelity, our strategy establishes metallaphotoredox catalysis as a versatile paradigm for heteroatom&#8208;centered stereochemistry.

         <title>Cis&#8208;Trans Isomerism Revealed in Circularly Polarized Luminescent Superatomic Ag28 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, cis&#8208;trans isomerism R&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans and S&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans were introduced into CPL superatomic nanoclusters. SCXRD shows that the Ag28 cluster has a chiral core&#8208;shell structure Ag12@Ag14S12, and two AgS units are differently attached to the framework, resulting in the cis&#8208;trans isomerism. The distinctions in electronic structures and optical performance were revealed with the theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters facilitate the exploration of chiral origin in metal nanomaterials, meanwhile, their structural isomers with subtle variations serve as ideal models for investigating the structure&#8208;property relationship at the atomic level. Here, we obtained two pairs of chiral superatomic cis&#8208;trans isomers with the formula [R/S&#8208;Ag28(SOC10H15)14(CF3COO)10] (denoted as R/S&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans), where the cis and trans configurations coexist within the R and S chiral forms, respectively. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis revealed that Ag28 clusters adopt a chiral core&#8208;shell configuration of Ag12@Ag14S12, consisting of an Ag12 kernel encapsulated within a chiral Ag14S12 cage. The additional two AgS units are located in a different fashion on the flanks of the framework, leading to the cis&#8208;trans isomerism of the silver clusters. DFT calculation reveals the distinctions in electronic structures and optical absorptions of the cis&#8208;trans isomers. The enantiomeric R/S&#8208;Ag28 exhibit intense red phosphorescence at 740&#160;nm in the crystalline state, and hold a &#8764;28&#160;nm blueshift in solution. Furthermore, R/S&#8208;Ag28 display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity, achieving a maximum (|glum|) value of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 in the crystalline state. This study enriches the diversity of chiral superatomic clusters and introduces cis&#8208;trans isomerism in metal clusters, establishing a novel platform to explore structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Compressed Co&#8211;O Bonds Resist Chlorine Corrosion to Enhance the Stability of Chlorine&#8208;Involved Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) over Co3O4 induces Cl corrosion through Cl coordination to Co sites. A Co3O4/SnO2 heterostructure with a shortened Co&#8211;O bond is designed to catalyze Cl&#8208;mediated epoxidation and other anodic chlorination reactions. The compressed Co&#8211;O bond of Co3O4/SnO2 leads to a restrained LOM, suppressing the interaction of Cl with Co sites and thus increasing structural stability.








Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;involved anodic reactions are essential for green manufacturing, whereas electrocatalysts suffer from deactivation due to Cl corrosion. Here, a Co3O4/SnO2 heterostructure with a shortened Co&#8211;O bond is designed to increase structural stability. The combined results of electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that the deactivation of Co3O4 involves the coordination of Cl to Co sites due to the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The compressed Co&#8211;O bond of Co3O4/SnO2 leads to a restrained LOM, thus resisting Cl&#8208;triggered corrosion. Therefore, Co3O4/SnO2 not only realizes the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of epoxides through the Cl&#8208;mediated method via stable and continuous electrocatalysis processes but is also suitable for other anodic chlorination reactions with enhanced durability. This work provides a facile way to prevent Cl corrosion by hindering LOM.

         <title>Lattice Hydrogen Participation and Mass Transport Acceleration Improve CO2 Electroreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced selectivity for C2 products achieved under broad&#8208;range high current densities via lattice hydrogen from Ho&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;stabilized CuH nanosheets participating in CO2RR.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction operated at high current densities typically face the critical issues of CO2 depletion and competing reactions. Here we prepared CuH branched nanosheets stabilized with holmium single atoms (HoSA&#8208;CuH). Finite&#8208;element analyses show that the branched HoSA&#8208;CuH structure could accelerate mass transport and alleviate CO2 depletion under high current densities. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Ho single atoms increase the electron density at Cu surface, which is conducive to CO2 enrichment and activation. Deuterium isotope labeling experiments confirm that the lattice hydrogen in CuH participate in the reaction, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step in C&#8211;C coupling. Therefore, the selectivity for C2+ over HoSA&#8208;CuH is above 80% under 700&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and C2 products account for 95% of all the C2+ products. Compared with the best&#8208;performing catalysts reported thus far, HoSA&#8208;CuH displays the broadest current density range for high FEC2.

         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;level electronic coupling between atomically dispersed Au single atoms and sub&#8208;nanometer clusters on ZrO2 induces significant O 2p&#8211;Zr 4d orbital hybridization, which optimizes the adsorption energetics of oxygen intermediates and simultaneously enhances both ORR and OER kinetics. The strong metal&#8211;support interaction further stabilizes the dual&#8208;active&#8208;site structure, enabling a Zn&#8211;air battery with exceptional cycling durability over 260 h and a record round&#8208;trip efficiency of 71.07%, surpassing all noble&#8208;metal benchmarks in power density and operational stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are fundamentally limited by the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen electrocatalysis, primarily due to the high surface energy and aggregation tendency of isolated metal atoms. Herein, we develop a low&#8208;temperature (200&#160;&#176;C) in situ thermal anchoring strategy to construct a hybrid Au catalyst (Au ACSA&#8211;ZrO2) comprising atomically dispersed Au single atoms and clusters stabilized on ZrO2 nanoparticles. This mild yet effective process induces strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI), leading to the formation of covalent Au&#8208;O&#8208;Zr interfacial bonds. These bonds effectively inhibit atomic migration and coalescence while simultaneously promoting interfacial charge transfer. Electronic coupling between Au single atoms and adjacent clusters induces significant hybridization between O 2p and Zr 4d orbitals, which modulates the local coordination environment and optimizes the adsorption energetics of oxygenated intermediates, thereby accelerating both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics. When applied in a Zn&#8211;air battery, this dual&#8208;site catalyst exhibits exceptional durability with 71.07% round&#8208;trip efficiency and negligible decay over 260&#160;h of continuous cycling, demonstrating that precise orbital interaction, achievable even at low synthesis temperatures, is crucial for high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalysis.

         <title>Construction of Small&#8208;Molecule Deubiquitinase&#8208;Targeting Chimeras to Reactivate and Stabilize Mutant p53 Y220C in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrated that DUBTAC A1 effectively reactivated and deubiquitinated mutant p53 Y220C in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this dual&#8208;action strategy proved superior to PK5196 (p53 Y220C reactivator) in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C&#8208;mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model, marking a significant advance for both p53 Y220C therapy and the broader DUBTAC field.








Abstract
Wild&#8208;type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is crucial in various pathological processes. The predominant strategy for p53 Y220C mutant involves binding reactivators to mutation&#8208;induced pocket to stabilize the protein thermally and restore wild&#8208;type structure. However, the corrected p53 Y220C remains vulnerable to ubiquitination, reducing protein levels and impairing function. Herein, we report the development of p53 Y220C&#8208;specific deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimeras (DUBTACs)&#8212;bifunctional small molecules concurrently recruiting both p53 Y220C and the deubiquitinase OTUB1. The most potent compound, A1, effectively restored wild&#8208;type conformation and potently removed ubiquitin. Furthermore, A1 demonstrated superior efficacy in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C&#8208;mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model. Our results demonstrated&#160;the viability of the DUBTAC strategy for p53 Y220C, successfully re&#8208;establishing conformation&#160;and promoting&#160;deubiquitination. More importantly, this study provides the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for DUBTAC application&#160;in vivo, establishing targeted deubiquitination as a therapeutic approach.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Hollow Spheres of Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Boron Capture from Brine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain engineering enables covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to undergo dynamic reconstruction, synergistically embedding polyol groups and advancing structural ordering. The resulting HSPCOF (hollow, stable, and polyol&#8208;functionalized COF) features uniform hollow particles and high surface area, achieving 150 mg&#160;g&#8722;1 adsorption at 298&#160;K within 180&#160;min, with outstanding adsorption performance even in complex Salt Lake brines.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold grand promise in chemical separations owing to their tunable pore architectures and rich functionalities. However, their practical efficacy is often plagued by disordered stacking and restricted accessibility of functional groups. In this study, we present a side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, which synergistically manipulates pore&#8208;wall functionalization, dynamic structural reconstruction, and bond stabilization, to fabricate hollow, stable, and polyol&#8208;functionalized COFs (HSPCOF) adsorbents for high&#8208;efficiency capture of boron from brine. For the first time, we demonstrate that side&#8208;chain&#8208;engineering can be employed to introduce polyol groups, enabling boron chelation while concurrently enhancing the crystallinity of COFs. The resultant HSPCOF exhibits a high specific surface area, interconnected channels, and exceptional boron adsorption capacity of 150.05&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K, within 180&#160;min, 10.29&#8208;fold higher than commercial resin MK51. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the HSPCOF preferentially binds borate anions via bidentate cyclic ester formation with polyol groups, affording strong affinity and high selectivity. Remarkably, HSPCOF maintains robust borate anion adsorption performance in harsh Salt Lake brine, achieving 848.79&#160;mg g&#8722;1 capacity and 91.51% removal efficiency, validating its practical utility. This work affords generic guidelines for designing crystal and functionally precise COF materials by side&#8208;chain engineering.

         <title>Homologative 1,3&#8208;Functionalization of Alkenes via an Iodomethyl Thianthrenium Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to access 1,3&#8208;functionalized patterns from alkenes remain limited. Recently, Silvi and co&#8208;workers reported a strategy to add the methyl thianthrenium radical across alkenes to rapidly produce 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles. The 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles can be diversified through sequential nucleophilic substitution reactions, delivering a wide array of 1,3&#8208;functionalized products.








Abstract
Despite tremendous progress in alkene 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, analogous methods to generate 1,3&#8208;patterns from alkenes remain limited. Recently, Silvi and co&#8208;workers reported a homologative strategy to transform alkenes into 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70005). They introduce a novel iodomethyl thianthrenium salt as a precursor to methyl thianthrenium radical, which adds across unactivated alkenes. Substitution of the 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles delivers a general homologative alkene difunctionalization platform.

Aromatic heterocycle engineering stabilizes TEMPO by redistributing charge and suppressing proton&#8208;induced degradation, as reported by Gang He et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202512613). The dimethylaminopyridine&#8208;functionalized derivative (DMA&#8208;TEMPO) achieves near&#8208;perfect cycling stability, highlighting a powerful molecular design strategy for durable organic catholytes in next&#8208;generation aqueous redox flow batteries.

In the Research Article by Anjana Devi and co&#8208;workers (e202513066) a new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex is introduced as a thermally stable atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. It features a rare mononuclear structure, suitable volatility, and a low melting point of 55 &#176;C. ALD trials yielded lithium silicate films. This study opens new directions for NHC&#8208;ligand chemistry in thin&#8208;film deposition applications.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;grafted hydrophobic polymer brushes play a critical role in surface modification. Hydrophobic polymer brushes are facilely but efficiently fabricated in pure aqueous phase with phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered water&#8208;immiscible monomers using methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the transport carrier. The method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers in an environment and user&#8208; and user&#8208;friendly manner. The resulting polymer brushes show great potential in information encoding and low&#8208;friction lubrication, as reported by Wei Li in their Research Article (e202516468).

An energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical platform enables dual&#8208;side formate production by pairing CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR), replacing the energy&#8208;intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With an optimized Cu3Ag7&#8208;based FOR anode and a BiOCl&#8208;based CO2RR cathode, the cell operates at just 0.5 V&#8208;1.5 V lower than the conventional OER||CO2RR setup, delivering markedly higher energy efficiency and productivity (e202516232)

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores the potential of micro&#8208;/nanorobots in treating neurological diseases, focusing on blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration, stem cell regulation, and energy metabolism modulation. These advancements shift treatment toward more precise, targeted therapies, with intelligent technologies offering promising prospects for revolutionizing care.








Abstract
Neurological diseases (NDs) are associated with barrier transport dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation, and impaired cellular energy metabolism, with bioenergetic deficits increasingly recognized as a central factor in disease progression. Micro&#8208;/nanorobots offer a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling active and targeted regulation of neuronal metabolism. Unlike passive nanocarriers, micro&#8208;/nanorobots can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) under external guidance and deliver therapeutic agents with subcellular precision. By integrating mitochondrial&#8208;targeting components, ATP&#8208;generating modules, and redox&#8208; or ion&#8208;responsive release systems, they can restore cellular energy supply and attenuate oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic function, synaptic activity, and neural repair. This minireview summarizes recent advances in micro&#8208;/nanorobot applications for drug delivery, barrier penetration, stem&#8208;cell differentiation, and metabolic regulation. It explores their potential roles in improving neuronal function, limiting pathological protein aggregation, and facilitating neural network reconstruction. Also, clinical translation faces significant challenges, including safety evaluation, large&#8208;scale manufacturing, and regulatory compliance. A therapeutic framework centered on micro&#8208;/nanorobot&#8208;mediated metabolic regulation may provide a novel and effective approach for treating NDs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent advances in photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement and its heteroatom variants (ODPM, ADPM), showcasing their evolution from UV&#8208;driven curiosities to versatile visible&#8208;light photocatalyzed reactions for synthesizing complex strained architectures through energy transfer mechanisms, enabling efficient synthesis of complex natural products and functional materials.








Abstract
Photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement, a classic transformation pioneered by Zimmerman, elegantly converts 1,4&#8208;dienes and related systems into complex, strain&#8208;rich vinylcyclopropane architectures. For decades, its utility in organic synthesis was constrained by its reliance on direct UV irradiation, which limited functional group tolerance and practical application. However, the recent integration of this elegant photochemical rearrangement with the principles of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer catalysis has sparked a dramatic renaissance. This review chronicles the journey of the DPM rearrangement from its foundational mechanistic principles to its modern catalytic incarnation. We detail the expansion of the reaction family&#8212;encompassing oxa&#8208; (ODPM) and aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ADPM) variants&#8212;and highlight its evolving applications in the total synthesis of natural products and beyond. Finally, we offer a perspective on future opportunities, underscoring how this venerable reaction continues to enable synthetic innovation and discovery in the 21st century.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells: From Failure Mechanisms to Practical Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines key failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, including short circuits caused by zinc dendrite, high polarization due to by&#8208;product accumulation, and swelling from H2 evolution. It highlights practical solutions such as anode protective layers, separator optimizations, and electrolyte designs (e.g., hydrogels, high&#8208;entropy, co&#8208;solvents, additives). Future directions for commercialization are also discussed.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been regarded as promising candidates for stationary energy storage owing to their low cost, inherent safety, and high volumetric energy density. To fully leverage these advantages in practical applications, the pouch cell configuration offers a favorable design with compactness and lightweight packaging. Nonetheless, commercial viability remains limited by inadequate cycling stability in pouch cells, despite the extended cycle life achieved in coin cells. In this review, we emphasize the performance gap between materials&#8208;level coin cells and device&#8208;level pouch cells and elucidate the failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type zinc&#8208;ion batteries. These mechanisms include internal short&#8208;circuits caused by severe zinc dendrite growth under high area capacity conditions, and high polarization resulting from by&#8208;product accumulation and hydrogen evolution due to water&#8208;induced corrosion. We then comprehensively review recent progress in zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells, highlighting strategies such as artificial protective layers on the Zn anode, separator modifications, and electrolyte design. Finally, we propose a future research direction to advance and commercialize zinc&#8208;ion battery technology.

Why should we divide noncovalent interactions into dozens of ambiguous bond types when it is completely unnecessary to do so?








Abstract
In a recent Scientific Perspective, Pizzi et&#160;al. recommend that &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole bonds should be named after the Periodic&#8208;Table group to which the electrophile belongs or, if greater specificity is required, after the element type of the electrophile. This could easily give rise to dozens of noncovalent bond types. The stated benefits of this naming scheme are of debatable value. In addition, it conceals the strong underlying similarity of the differently named interactions. The obvious alternative is to use the terms that reflect the physical natures of these interactions: &#963;&#8208;hole bond, &#960;&#8208;hole bond and, possibly, p&#8208;hole bond. The concerns that Pizzi et&#160;al. have about these terms are shown here to be unjustified, largely because they are based on irrelevant hypothetical interactions. The benefits of using &#963;&#8208;, &#960;&#8208; and p&#8208;hole bonds instead of dozens of individual names are simplicity, greater clarity and a lack of ambiguity.

         <title>Hybrid of Indolizine and Merocyanine&#8212;A New Class of Organelle&#8208;Specific Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new merocyanines and cyanines possessing an indolizine scaffold were synthesized via tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, by leveraging the special reactivity of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. Indolizine scaffold as a donor enables the bathochromic shift of emission independent of solvent polarity, whereas indolizine&#8211;cyanine selectively marks mitochondria or RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli. 








Abstract
Unlocking the potential of electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;hydroxyindolizines led to the discovery of a new class of dyes&#8212;indolizine&#8208;merocyanines (IndMer) and indolizine&#8208;cyanines. Tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution afforded structurally diverse dyes, as both the nucleophilic and electrophilic partners can be broadly modified. A convergent fragment coupling strategy allowed rapid access to these &#960;&#8208;conjugated merocyanines in three steps from pyridines. Uniform distribution of the HOMO and LUMO combined with negligible change of dipole moment upon excitation is responsible for the intense orange or red emission of this new family of reasonably photostable dyes in a broad range of solvents. The new merocyanine dyes have the potential to target a variety of organelles&#8212;both uncharged and positively charged indolizine&#8211;merocyanines localize a subset of cellular lysosomes, positively charged indolizine&#8211;cyanine hybrid accumulates in mitochondria, while coumarin&#8211;merocyanine shows context&#8208;dependent localization to mitochondria and RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli of the living cells.

         <title>Redox Noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Enabling Electron Transfer Catalysis</title>

The redox noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has been evaluated for indole alkoxycarboxylation reactions, where the electron&#8208;rich ligand backbone steers the electron transfer reactions.








Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is an iconic class of ligand that spans a wide variety of metal complexes across the periodic table. Compared to the well&#8208;evaluated redox noninnocent nature of several other ligand classes, detectable redox activity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is scarce. The development of an effective homogeneous catalyst leveraging the redox reservoir property of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has never been achieved. Herein, we present a copper bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) complex that enables the completely ligand&#8208;centric redox for steering alkoxycarboxylation at the 2&#8208;position of indole. The success of the reaction pivots on the electron reservoir property of an electron&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;diketiminate that can facilitate single electron transfer to reductively cleave a C&#9472;Br bond. X&#8208;ray structure determination of the complex, along with CV, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility, describes the electronic structure of the catalyst molecule and proves the ligand's predominant role in such single&#8208;electron transfer catalysis.

         <title>Photochargeable Nanopores in Gas Permselective Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework, a photochargeable CO2 permselective mixed&#8208;matrix membrane is realized. Photocharging leads to enhanced CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity.








Abstract
Gas permselective membranes are inherently constrained by a trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity. Overcoming this limitation is key to enabling broader industrial adoption, and advanced porous materials&#8212;particularly metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8212;has emerged as promising candidate. Yet, to truly rival established separation technologies such as, distillation, pressure swing adsorption and chemisorption, innovative design strategies remain essential. Traditionally, efforts to surpass the trade&#8208;off have focused on regulating porosity, pore architecture, pore surface chemical functionality, and macroscopic transport pathways (particle morphology). These modifications are achieved either through bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches or by employing external stimuli such as light, pressure, or electric fields. In this work, we introduce a photochargeable membrane that enhances gas permselectivity through precise, molecule&#8208;specific interactions&#8212;without altering the underlying porous architecture. This is achieved by incorporating a nanoporous MOF, constructed from redox&#8208;active organic ligands, as filler in a mixed matrix membrane. Upon photoexcitation, ligand&#8211;ligand charge separation yields stable pore surface charges, facilitating selective interactions with quadrupolar CO2. This specific interaction enhances CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept can be explored for mixed and high purity gas feed preparation.

         <title>Quantum Interference Effect in Saturated Systems: Effect of Anchoring Group Position on Conductance of Bipiperidines and their in&#8208;situ Derived Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates distinct quantum interference effect in saturated systems as compared to their unsaturated counterparts and the origin of multiple conductance features observed in single molecule conductance experiments of different isomers of bipiperdine and their in&#8208;situ generated dithiocarbamates.








Abstract
This study investigates quantum interference in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems, focusing on the impact of anchoring group nature and its position. Using a combined approach of mechanically controlled break junction experiments and quantum transport calculations, we demonstrate that meta&#8208;connected &#963;&#8208;conducting bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular junctions exhibit higher conductance than para&#8208;connected ones. This trend is opposite to that of the trend typically observed in &#960;&#8208;molecular systems, indicating the existence of distinctly different quantum interference phenomenon in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems. Further, we show that anchoring group modifications achieved through in&#8208;situ dithiocarbamylation significantly alters the conductance and decay factors. We also elucidate the mechanism behind multiple conductance features observed in aliphatic bipiperidines with cyclic secondary amine and dithiocarbamate anchoring groups. This work demonstrates &#963;&#8208;quantum interference in bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular systems and highlights how changes in junction configuration, nature of the anchoring group and its position can be used to control conductance in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems.

         <title>Anhydride&#8208;form Cellulose Derivatives: Synthesis, in Situ Reactive Separation, and Solvent Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the differential reactivity of acyl chlorides and anhydrides, we introduce anhydrides into the cellulose backbone. Ammonolysis of the anhydrides enables an in situ reactive separation without external precipitants within the cellulose solvents. Cellulose derivatives can be processed into films and fiber materials through aqueous solution, with an anhydride form offering a variety of reactive designs.








Abstract
The utilization of cellulose remains underexploited due to the use of toxic solvents, high energy consumption, difficulty in separation, and environmental concerns during dissolution, processing, and separation processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride cellulose (PAC), the first reported anhydride&#8208;form cellulose derivative, and in situ reactive separation of the cellulose derivatives by introducing ammonia gas. PAC is synthesized by a catalyst&#8208;free esterification reaction between cellulose and trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC). Excess ammonia is then added to convert the anhydride into a water&#8208;soluble amide&#8208;ammonium salt, resulting in the complete precipitation of all reactants from the homogeneous organic phase, thus achieving in situ reactive separation without external precipitants and producing phthalamide acid cellulose (PAAC). A simple solid&#8208;liquid separation allows for a solvent recovery efficiency of 90%. PAAC can dissolve in water and be processed into film and fiber materials, avoiding safety issues related to toxic or organic solvent processing. After processing, PAAC can be converted into phthalimide cellulose (PIC) or PAC by thermal treatment. PIC is a water&#8208;insoluble imide&#8208;form derivative with excellent resistance to organic solvents, acids, and heat, while PAC serves as a multi&#8208;functional platform for carrying out various functional reactions of anhydrides on demand.

         <title>Quantifying the Biodegradation of Water&#8208;Soluble Polymer Mixtures with Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fate of polymers in liquid formulations in natural environments has not been extensively researched, in part as a result of incompatible analytical techniques. We show that diffusion NMR spectroscopy can be used to quantify the simultaneous biodegradation of multiple water&#8208;soluble polymers with limited sample preparation, measuring the molar mass, and chemical composition of multiple species with no molar mass restriction.








Abstract
Polymers in liquid formulations result in 36 million tons of waste each year. It is estimated that 13% of these polymers directly enter, and accumulate in, natural environments, however, their fate is poorly understood; in part as a consequence of challenges in characterizing how the polymers biodegrade. Multiple analytical techniques have been used to quantify polymer biodegradation but require extensive sample preparation and can only measure one species accurately at a time, inhibiting the measurement of water&#8208;soluble polymer mixtures. Here, we report the application of diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an alternative method to enable the facile monitoring of polymer biodegradation. This technique uniquely aids the understanding of biodegradation mechanisms, by measuring chemical as well as molar mass changes, concurrently, for both the polymer and degradation products. Furthermore, the ability to detect and measure the molar mass of multiple separate species enables the measurement of simultaneous biodegradation of polymer mixtures, including polymers with different chemical structures but the same molar mass.

         <title>Influence of the Acid Reactivity of Carbenium Ions in Zeolites on the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we studied the Br&#248;nsted acid reactivity of polymethylbenzenium and alkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentenyl cations, key intermediates in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. CD3CN selectively and reversibly deprotonates benzenium ions, while cyclopentenyl cations require stronger bases. These results reveal a reactivity scale and provide insight into carbocation chemistry in reactive environments.








Abstract
Carbocations are typical intermediates in acid catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry synthesis. Confinement within the framework of zeotype materials distinguishes the function of carbenium ions as catalytic centers in various chemical processes. A selective and reversible deprotonation event of benzenium ions built in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 during methanol conversion was observed by experiment and theory as a result of CD3CN dosage, denoting their higher acid reactivity compared to the cyclopentenyl cations, which undergo deprotonation only in presence of pyridine. This study uncovers the inverse relationship between the acid reactivity of carbenium ions of different nature and their stability in the surface&#8208;bound state.

A desymmetrization strategy for an enantioselective Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling to access highly enantioenriched, axially chiral biaryl boronic esters is disclosed. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct.








Abstract
An efficient protocol for a desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl bis(nonaflates) and B&#8211;B reagents is disclosed. An in situ&#8208;formed palladium(0)&#8211;(S,S)&#8208;f&#8208;Binaphane complex discriminates between the enantiotopic nonaflate groups, and the subsequent transmetalation of the B&#8211;B reagent is enhanced by a copper co&#8208;catalyst. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct. This enantioselective Miyaura reaction enables the synthesis of highly valuable, axially chiral boron compounds with superb enantiomeric ratios (up to e.r.&#160;= 99:1) and exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Failure Mechanism of High&#8208;Temperature Li&#8211;S Batteries in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insufficient Li2S dissociation and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be dominant factors for the rapid performance deterioration of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in r&#8208;LHCE. To this end, B&#8208;LMCE featured by suitable anion concentration and weak solvation ability is developed, which concurrently alleviates electrolyte consumption, restricts polysulfide shuttling, and enables kinetically favorable sulfur redox reaction at elevated temperatures with a tailored electrochemical voltage range.








Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes struggle to sustain steady operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries at high temperatures due to inferior thermal durability and aggravated parasitic reactions. Although localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance thermal stability, its deployment in high&#8208;temperature (HT) Li&#8211;S batteries has met with limited success. Herein, the failure mechanism of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in LHCE is revealed via probing sulfur redox reactions and electrolyte solvation chemistry. Slow reaction kinetics and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be the dominant factors causing the rapid capacity deterioration at high temperatures. To this end, a diethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based localized medium concentration electrolyte (B&#8208;LMCE) with suitable anion concentration and weakly solvating effect is developed. The new electrolyte concurrently achieves fast cathode kinetics and stable anode/electrolyte interface. With the assistance of a tailored electrochemical voltage range of 1&#8211;3.8&#160;V, Li&#8211;S batteries sustain a durable cycling performance over 250 cycles at 60 &#176;C. They also showcase superior wide&#8208;temperature operation (0&#160;&#176;C&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C) while enabling feasible fabrication of Ah&#8208;level pouch cells. Our study opens a new avenue for designing extreme&#8208;temperature electrolytes toward pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cis/Trans Isomerization of a Metal Centre Involving a Metal&#8208;Organic Halogen&#8208;Bonded (MOXB) Cocrystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization&#8208;enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours.








Abstract
Halogen bonding enables the mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling isomerization of an otherwise persistent cis&#8208;coordinated metal complex into the corresponding trans&#8208;isomer. The importance of halogen bonding for enabling the cis&#8594;trans isomerization of the metal centre is evidenced by real&#8208;time in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction monitoring of the ball&#8208;milling experiments that showed the transient appearance of a cis&#8208;geometry metal&#8208;organic halogen&#8208;bonded (MOXB) cocrystal, which is rapidly replaced by the corresponding trans&#8208;geometry one, with any excess, non&#8208;halogen&#8208;bonded cis&#8208;geometry complex being retained throughout the milling experiment. The importance of cocrystallization for cis&#8594;trans isomerization is supported by periodic density&#8208;functional theory calculations which show that the process becomes notably more enthalpically favourable in the presence of the halogen bond donor. The presented work indicates that the formation of MOXB cocrystals can open the door to new, metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours, different from those of parent solid&#8208;state coordination complexes.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Based Azo Compound&#8208;Mediated CO Activation and N2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare silicon(IV)&#8208;based azo compound featuring a Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkage was synthesized via the direct reaction of an organoazide with a silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor. This compound undergoes an unusual CO activation process, resulting in N2 release and complete cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond, forming a Si(II)/Si(IV) product bridged by an oxygen atom and an organic isonitrile.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;substituted azo compounds featuring Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkages remain elusive in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a silicon&#8208;based azo compound generated directly from a mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor and a bulky organic azide. Unlike classical iminosilane formation, this reaction affords a thermally stable Si(IV)&#8211;azo species. Upon treatment with carbon monoxide (CO), this compound undergoes N2 extrusion, complete C&#8801;O bond cleavage, and formation of a formal Si(II)/Si(IV) product in which an oxygen atom bridges both silicon centers. Notably, the transformation incorporates the carbon atom into a DippNC byproduct via ligand rearrangement. A similar transformation occurs upon reaction with Fe(CO)5, wherein N2 release and CO cleavage also occur, but with the resulting Fe(CO)4 fragment coordinating to the silicon center. These results demonstrate a rare example of silicon based azo&#8208;mediated small&#8208;molecule activation and highlight the potential of silicon&#8208;based systems for multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry typically associated with transition metals.

&lt;p&gt;A rare silicon(IV)-based azo compound featuring a Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkage was synthesized via the direct reaction of an organoazide with a silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor. This compound undergoes an unusual CO activation process, resulting in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and complete cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond, forming a Si(II)/Si(IV) product bridged by an oxygen atom and an organic isonitrile.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) Using a Super&#8208;Reducing Photoredox Catalyst</title>

A super&#8208;reducing organic photocatalyst expands the scope of O&#8208;ATRP to challenging initiators and monomers. The system enables controlled polymerizations with air tolerance, temporal regulation, and grafting&#8208;from strategies, highlighting the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.








Abstract
The development of highly reducing photoredox catalysts (PCs) has brought forth new approaches to activating strong chemical bonds for small molecule and polymer synthesis. Organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) is a polymerization methodology that uses organic PCs for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers proceeding through a reversible&#8208;deactivation mechanism. However, the reaction scope of O&#8208;ATRP is confined to initiators and dormant polymer states that can be reduced by a PC. Herein, we report an O&#8208;ATRP system using a super&#8208;reducing PC to expand the capability of O&#8208;ATRP to monomers (such as styrene (St) and vinylcarbazole (VCz)) and initiators (including aromatic halides and pseudo&#8208;halides) that are challenging with most O&#8208;ATRP systems. This system provides control over polymerization, air tolerance, and temporal regulation and enables the synthesis of polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting&#8208;from reactions on linear chains. This strategy builds upon the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs toward advancing the field of reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.

A &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent can synergistically target amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology and innate immunity, achieving a heightened efficacy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapeutics.








Abstract
Recent progress in antibody&#8208;based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical benefits, and pro&#8208;inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA) that synergistically targets amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA actively migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed &#946;&#8208;secretase, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from A&#946; antigen&#8208;specific Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage A&#946; and inflammatory microglia, thereby synergistically eradicating A&#946; and reducing pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. In AD mouse models, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust A&#946; removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings highlight ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA as next&#8208;generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the limitations of conventional antibody&#8208;based treatments for AD.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Channel Gas&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Switch: Realizing a Reversible Fluorescent Response to HCl and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the first metal&#8211;organic frameworks integrating molecular conformation locking and coordination&#8208;induced energy transfer mechanism for fluorescent sensing of harmful gases were rationally designed and constructed. Ln&#8208;TCPE achieves a reversible fluorescent response to HCl gas through the dual channels while Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves a reversible fluorescent response to NH3 gas through the single channel. This study provides more detailed and deeper mechanistic insights into the fluorescent gas responsive process.








Abstract
Luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) provide exceptional advantages over conventional materials in detecting harmful gases. However, challenges remain, such as limited stability, unclear fluorescence signal changes and insufficient mechanistic understanding. In this study, we developed two types of lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting rapid (&lt;5&#160;s) and reversible fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses to vapor exposure. Specifically, Ln&#8208;TCPE demonstrates a swift response to HCl vapor via a unique dual&#8208;channel mechanism: highly dipolar HCl molecules stabilize the conformation of tetraphenylethylene ligands through weak intermolecular interactions, causing a 780% increase in fluorescence intensity. Simultaneously, HCl coordination with Ln3+ triggers a pronounced 45&#160;nm redshift in fluorescence by altering the MOFs' overall energy and electron transfer dynamics. The combination of these two signals greatly amplifies the fluorescence transition. Outstanding stability allows the sample's initial fluorescence to be fully restored through simple thermal desorption, enabling recyclability. With fewer open metal sites, Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; detection of NH3 vapor solely via benzene ring locking, and it can likewise be recycled. This study presents the first report of such dual&#8208;channel gas&#8208;responsive LMOFs. We thoroughly elucidated the underlying mechanisms through experimental work and DFT calculations, paving the way for new advancements in LMOFs&#8208;based gas sensing.

         <title>Synergic Coordination Effect in Nonflammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel sodium&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte, which is induced to form by the double synergistic action of Na&#9472;O and hydrogen bonding together, and the unique solvated structure significantly enhances the compatibility at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which leads to the excellent performance of the sodium&#8208;ion batteries. 








Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are emerging as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation electrolytes, poised to revolutionize the performance of safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, a significant challenge hindering the progress of SIBs is the scarcity of suitable DEEs capable of harmonizing electrolyte conductivity, interfacial compatibility, and safety. In this study, we have engineered a DEE leveraging the synergistic interplay between Na&#8208;bonds and hydrogen bonds, achieved through the integration of N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA) and sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). The findings reveal that the distinctive interaction between the polar C&#9552;O group in NMA and Na+ ions, coupled with hydrogen bonding with DFOB&#8722; anions, facilitates the formation of the DEE. The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na+/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance. The incorporation of amide&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes into SIBs infuses fresh vitality into electrolyte design, propelling the advancement of high&#8208;performance SIBs.

In this study, we have engineered a DEE leveraging the synergistic interplay between Na-bonds and hydrogen bonds, achieved through the integration of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylacetamide (NMA) and sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). The findings reveal that the distinctive interaction between the polar C&#9552;O group in NMA and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, coupled with hydrogen bonding with DFOB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, facilitates the formation of the DEE. The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance. The incorporation of amide-based eutectic electrolytes into SIBs infuses fresh vitality into electrolyte design, propelling the advancement of high-performance SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prediction of One&#8208;Dimensional Metallicity and &#960;&#8208;Band Superconductivity in Rhodizonate Radical Pancakes</title>

         <dc:description>
Equidistant stacking of radicals is typically unstable due to symmetry&#8208;lowering distortions. We predict that such arrangements can be stabilized by multicentered covalent (&#8220;pancake&#8221;) bonding and Coulombic repulsion between negatively charged radicals. This leads to design principles for a new class of organic conductors&#8212;potentially superconductors&#8212;based on abundant, environmentally benign elements. 








Abstract
Computational exploration of condensed phases made of potassium and carbon monoxide leads to predictions of stable salts composed of cyclic six&#8208;membered oxocarbon anions and K+ cations, Kn(C6O6)m. The states of reduction in these systems are wide&#8208;ranging, with C6O6 molecules formally reduced by &#8722;2, &#8722;3, &#8722;3.5, and &#8722;6 in semiconducting and metallic phases. Special attention is paid to K3C6O6, in which triply charged radical anions stack closely and equidistantly in one dimension. Equidistant interactions of radicals are exceedingly rare and typically unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, Peierls or Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The predicted exception of K3C6O6 is explained by inter&#8208;ring multicenter bonding, also known as pancake bonding, in combination with large ionic repulsion. This fascinating interplay of interactions facilitates an exceptionally high density of states at the Fermi level and leads us to predictions of metallicity, a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity, and rare &#960;&#8208;band superconductivity. These predictions reinvigorate the search for new organic conductors and superconductors using molecular design of metallic salts.

         <title>Polycyclic Heteroaromatics with Planar&#8208;Curved Hybrid Skeletons for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One kind of polycyclic heteroaromatics with the unique planar&#8208;negatively curved hybrid skeletons was constructed through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of NBN&#8208;embedded dibenzophenalene. Their photophysical properties, electrochemical behaviors, and hydrogen bond interactions can be significantly improved through tuning their curvatures. Upon visible&#8208;light stimulation, they enable high&#8208;performance photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Creating curvature in the scaffolds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enables breaking their molecular planarity or even symmetry, leading to some exceptional optoelectronic activities and assembling behaviors, but rarely explored for promoting photoredox catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of two PAHs through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of a dibenzophenalene precursor edged with a pristine zigzag nitrogen (N)&#8211;boron (B)&#8211;nitrogen (N) unit. Their unique planar&#8208;negatively curved molecular skeletons were revealed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. Fusing another benzene ring at the terminal positions of such kinds of PAH molecules resulted in a more contorted structure, which led to the successive reversible electrochemical behaviors, stronger hydrophilicity, and better photogenerated charge generation and separation as evidenced by experimental and theoretical data. Upon visible&#8208;light activation, the as&#8208;prepared PAHs showed a curvature&#8208;strengthened photocatalytic activity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (yield: up to 6696&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) with good recyclability and reusability. Finally, the femtosecond transient absorption spectra (fs&#8208;TAS) indicate that the more curved structure Nap&#8208;NBN&#8208;PAH has more photogenerated charges and a longer excited state lifetime, which is consistent with better photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Simultaneous Measurement of RNA Synthesis and Degradation Rates in Single Cells Unveils the Regulatory Mechanisms of Temporal RNA Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double metabolic RNA labeling&#8208;based single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method (scDUAL&#8208;seq) was developed to measure RNA synthesis and degradation rates simultaneously in single cells. scDUAL&#8208;seq resolves the cell cycle&#8208;dependent variations of RNA kinetic rates in cortisol response, identifies the underlying regulatory strategies, and elucidates the coordinated regulation of RNA kinetic rates that control distinct strategy transitions.








Abstract
The temporal dynamics of coordinated RNA transcription and degradation are heterogeneous among different cell types or states. However, current transcriptomic approaches are unable to simultaneously measure transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA synthesis and degradation rates in single cells for resolving the RNA regulatory mechanisms during dynamic processes. Herein, we develop scDUAL&#8208;seq, which integrates double nucleoside analogs pulse&#8208;pulse labeling, chemical nucleoside conversion, and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing to record both RNA transcription and RNA degradation in heterogeneous cell populations. Compared to single nucleoside analog labeling&#8208;based methods, scDUAL&#8208;seq allows simultaneous recording of RNA transcription and degradation, leading to more accurate determination of RNA kinetic rates and RNA regulatory strategies. In a cortisol response model, scDUAL&#8208;seq enables the discovery of key regulons driving strategy transitions and elucidation of the coordinated regulation of RNA synthesis and degradation rates that control distinct strategy transitions. scDUAL&#8208;seq is expected to provide new insights into RNA regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological processes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Conjugated Macrocyclic BODIPYs for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic substitution&#8208;cyclization&#8208;dehydrogenation reactions generate a photosensitizer exhibiting enhanced non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. 








Abstract
With this research we developed a cyclization strategy that effectively converts radiative transitions (RTs) to non&#8208;radiative transitions (NRTs) during the decay process of BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers. Compared to BODIPY monomers, cyclization leads to a significant decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and a significant increase in the HOMO energy. In particular, the absorption spectrum of 7a exhibits a significant redshift, with the maximum absorption wavelength reaching 794&#160;nm. Photophysical characterization indicates that the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d) exhibit a reduced RT process. While, the crystal structure and theoretical calculations suggest that the molecular ring distortion enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d). In addition 7a&#8208;NPs constructed using DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 encapsulation exhibit excellent water solubility, stability, and photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%). The photothermal therapeutic performance of 7a&#8208;NPs was evaluated through in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments. The results indicated that 7a&#8208;NPs could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near&#8208;infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali&#8208;induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo&#8208;thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Modulation of Ion Clustering and Polymer Crystallinity for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;driven modulation effectively tailors ion clustering and polymer crystallinity, significantly enhancing low&#8208;temperature performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with diverse inorganic&#8208;rich SEI species demonstrates superior ionic conductivity, coulombic efficiency, and capacity retention at &#8722;20&#176;C compared to conventional electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries have garnered significant attention for their intrinsic safety and high energy density. Among various solid&#8208;state electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer their excellent processability and interfacial compatibility but suffer from the formation of large ionic clusters and crystallization, which hinder Li+ transport and desolvation, particularly at low temperatures (e.g., deep&#8208;sea conditions). In this study, a multicomponent strategy is adopted to enhance the configurational entropy of SPEs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold reduction in Li cluster size and suppression of polymer crystallization. These changes facilitate rapid desolvation and promote the formation of a high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase. Owing to these benefits, the resulting SPEs exhibit an 8.5&#8208;fold improvement in ionic conductivity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (0.17 mS cm&#8722;1). The Li/Cu cells exhibit an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.59% over 300 cycles at room temperature, and maintain nearly unchanged CE even after a temperature drop to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the Li/LiFePO4 cells (N/P&#160;=&#160;4) achieve a 13&#8208;fold capacity improvement and an average capacity retention of 91.49% after 500 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C (over 248 days). This strategy builds a new approach for high performance SPEs for practical low&#8208;temperature operation.

Fused B&#8208;N coordinated organic NIR phosphors (TPP&#8208;BN/BF) with 819&#160;nm emission and 28.6&#160;ms lifetime are synthesized. PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG nanoengineering yields nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;folds enhanced afterglow. A GrB&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) leveraging peptide&#8211;PRET enables tumor immune monitoring with a 216.4 signal&#8208;background ratio, advancing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging, and programmable immunity assessments via molecular&#8208;to&#8208;nanoscale RTP design.








Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold great potential for bioimaging due to their ability to eliminate background noise and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we synthesized octa&#8208;ring fused RTP molecules (TPP&#8208;BN and TPP&#8208;BF) with B&#9472;N coordination bonds via a two&#8208;step reaction, enabling NIR phosphorescent emission at 819&#160;nm and a 28.6&#160;ms lifetime. Using PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG as host and surfactant to stabilize the RTP molecules, we fabricated PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG based nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;fold brighter afterglow than conventional F127&#8208;based methods (FNPs). We further developed a granzyme B (GrB)&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) that achieves specific and quantitative detection. In vivo studies demonstrated their ability to monitor and distinguish tumor immune response with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) as high as 216.4. This study provides a new method for constructing NIR organic RTP probes and advances applications of RTP materials in real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and tumor immune monitoring.

         <title>Studies of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Epoxyketone Synthesis by Small&#8208;Molecule Flavins and Flavoenzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
A combined synthetic and biochemical approach links the flavoenzyme EpxF to three key steps in epoxomicin biosynthesis. Crystallography, mutagenesis, and 13C&#8208;labeling complete the mechanistic picture of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone formation and illustrate the potential of flavin&#8208;mediated transformations.








Abstract
Epoxomicin is a highly potent natural proteasome inhibitor and the structural scaffold for the anticancer drug carfilzomib. The biosynthesis of its &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone warhead involves the flavoenzyme EpxF, but a molecular understanding of the key catalytic reaction cascade remained elusive. Here, we disclose detailed mechanistic insights by characterizing all intermediates in the sequential steps of decarboxylation, desaturation, and epoxidation with synthetic flavins and the flavin&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase EpxF. A high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of EpxF revealed the architecture of the active site and enabled the identification of key catalytic residues. Exploratory docking based on this structure served as a qualitative tool to guide mutagenesis and rationalize substrate recognition. NMR studies with a 13C&#8208;labeled epoxomicin precursor and structure&#8208;based EpxF variants further supported the proposed mechanism. Our integrated approach revealed similarities between synthetic and natural flavin catalysts and offers avenues for developing sustainable biomimetic reactions.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Resistant N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked TEMPO Catholytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of proton&#8208;resistant TEMPO catholytes were developed via N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and heterocycle grafting, enabling efficient charge redistribution and exceptional redox stability. The optimized DMA&#8208;TEMPO derivative delivers near&#8208;quantitative capacity retention (99.98% over 560 cycles), offering a robust molecular design strategy for durable AORFBs.








Abstract
TEMPO is a widely studied catholyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) but suffers from proton&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening degradation when its solubility is enhanced via hydrophilic substitution at the 4&#8208;position, leading to structural failure and rapid capacity fade. To address this issue, five TEMPO derivatives were synthesized through N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle grafting strategy. Combined analyses using atomic dipole moment&#8208;corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) charges, Fukui functions, and linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LTQ&#8208;XL) reveal that aromatic heterocycle functionalization enables favorable charge redistribution during redox cycling, enhancing both redox kinetics and molecular stability. In particular, dimethylaminopyridine&#8208;functionalized TEMPO (DMA&#8208;TEMPO) exhibits enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation and basicity, which suppresses proton&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and significantly improves structural resilience. 1&#160;M DMA&#8208;TEMPO catholyte delivers exceptional cycling performance, retaining 99.98% of its capacity after 560 cycles, while 2&#160;M system maintains 97% capacity over 100 cycles. Compared to its structural analog 1&#160;M PA&#8208;TEMPO, the cycle life is improved 18&#8208;fold. This study offers a robust molecular design strategy for developing proton&#8208;resistant catholytes, advancing the practical deployment of long&#8208;lasting AORFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

A new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex is introduced as a thermally stable atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. It features a rare mononuclear structure, suitable volatility, and a low melting point of 55&#160;&#176;C. ALD trials yielded lithium silicate films. This study opens new directions for NHC&#8208;ligand chemistry in thin&#8208;film deposition applications.








Abstract
Lithium is the core material of modern battery technologies and fabricating the lithium&#8208;containing materials with atomic layer deposition (ALD) confers significant benefits in control of film composition and thickness. In this work, a new mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex, [Li(tBuNHC)(hmds)], is introduced as a promising precursor for ALD of lithium&#8208;containing thin films. Structural characterization is performed, comparing density functional theory (DFT) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), confirming a rare mononuclear structure. Favorable thermal properties for ALD applications are evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The compound exhibits a low melting point, clean evaporation, and its volatility parameters are encouraging compared to other lithium precursors. ALD trials using [Li(tBuNHC)(hmds)] with ozone demonstrate its effectiveness in depositing LiSixOy films. The ALD process exhibits a saturated growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.95&#160;&#197;. Compositional analysis&#160;using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry/nuclear reaction analysis (RBS/NRA), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD&#8208;OES), confirms the presence of lithium and silicon in the expected ratios. This work not only presents a new ALD precursor but also contributes to the understanding of lithium chemistry, offering insights into the intriguing coordination chemistry and thermal behavior of lithium complexes stabilized by NHC ligands.

         <title>Continuous Dual Hydrogenation of Biomass Substrates in a Membrane&#8208;Free Solid Electrolyte Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic dual hydrogenation method has been developed using hydrazine and cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, enhancing continuous biomass conversion to succinic acid with substantial hydrogenation Faraday efficiency (200%) and long durability (200&#160;h, 100&#160;mA) in a membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor. This advancement highlights significant potential for sustainable green chemistry applications.








Abstract
Production of chemicals from biomass through electrocatalytic hydrogenation shows great potential to reduce environmental impact across various applications in sustainable materials, medicine, food, and more. Particularly, dual electrocatalytic hydrogenation, leveraging concurrent reactions at both anode and cathode stand out with maximized electron efficiency (&#8764;200%) and production yield. However, at higher voltages, anodic hydrogen atoms (H*) tend to revert to protons. This tendency results in challenges such as low conversion rates and selectivity, and difficulties in maintaining continuous production. Herein, by employing hydrazine and water as the hydrogen sources for anode and cathode reactions, respectively, we achieved efficient dual hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid. This approach produces two H* atoms per electron transferred, promoting effective carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation at both cathode and anode. We further developed a modular, membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor for continuous dual hydrogenation of maleic acid using a commercial cobalt catalyst. By leveraging the hydrazine oxidation and water reduction, the reactor consistently produces succinic acid with a Faraday efficiency of approximately 180% for over 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA. Our approach shows significant potential for practical applications in green chemistry, particularly in efficient biomass conversion.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule DNA Tweezers Enable Programmable Control of Enzyme Activity via Arbitrary Molecular Cues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling enzyme activity with molecular precision remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a DNA&#8208;based strategy for the dynamic and programmable regulation of enzyme function in response to arbitrary, user&#8208;defined chemical cues. We report the development of single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs)&#8212;structures that can be programmed to bind and inhibit enzymes, then release upon sensing specific signals, restoring activity.








Abstract
Engineering allosteric control sites into enzymes typically requires extensive protein modification. Here, we introduce single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs), which enable programmable, allosteric&#8208;like regulation of enzyme activity in response to user&#8208;defined chemical cues, without altering the enzyme itself. SMDTs consist of two aptamers connected by a tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA linker. By binding non&#8208;covalently to two distinct sites on an enzyme, the SMDT adopts a &#8220;pinched&#8221; conformation, reminiscent of mechanical tweezers, that inhibits enzymatic activity. Upon exposure to specific molecular triggers, the SMDT undergoes a conformational change that releases the inhibitory aptamer, restoring function. The degree of inhibition and reactivation efficiency can be finely tuned by adjusting the DNA linker's length, sequence, flexibility, and geometry. Operating at nanomolar concentrations, the system exhibits high specificity, capable of discriminating between closely related inputs, including single&#8208;base mismatches in nucleic acids. Importantly, SMDTs can be programmed to respond not only to molecular abundance but also to molecular activity. We show the versatility of this platform by regulating enzymes using diverse triggers, including nucleic acids, transcription factors (TATA&#8208;binding protein [TBP], cellular myelocytomatosis [c&#8208;Myc]), signaling proteins (platelet&#8208;derived growth factor [PDGF]), small molecules (kanamycin), and metal ions (Mn2+). These results establish a generalizable framework for designing responsive protein binders that translate molecular recognition into functional outcomes.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B cross&#8208;coupling method was developed, utilizing commercially available 10BF3. This approach features a Lewis acid/base activation strategy to generate reactive borenium ions in situ. It enables the efficient synthesis of a wide range of 10B&#8208;enriched organoboron compounds, which hold significant potential for applications in boron neutron capture therapy drug development and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.








Abstract
The boron&#8208;10 isotope (10B) is critical for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); however, the direct use of industrially available 10BF3 for synthesizing 10B&#8208;enriched compounds remains challenging due to the strong B&#9472;F bonds. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol that enables direct C(sp2)&#9472;10B bond formation using 10BF3. This approach employs AlCl3 and a Lewis base to generate electrophilic borenium ions in situ. The method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized boron reagents, providing an efficient route to diverse 10B&#8208;enriched compounds with promising applications in BNCT and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.

         <title>Localizing the Long&#8208;Range Disorder of Reconstructed Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is finely localized by fluoride&#8208;mediated stabilization of lattice Co sites during reconstruction. The localized long&#8208;range disorder efficiently promotes Co&#9472;O covalency and induces tensile strain, leading to balanced activation and regeneration of lattice oxygen for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).








Abstract
Controlling the long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed nanostructures represents a challenging but important approach for achieving practical catalysts with high performance. Here, we report a facile fluoride&#8208;mediated&#8208;stabilization strategy to finely localize the long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions with compatible lattice&#8208;oxygen activation and regeneration for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). The stabilized lattice Co by fluoride&#8208;induced bond reinforcing in pre&#8208;catalysts enabled localized long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous oxyhydroxides. The localized long&#8208;range disorder can promote Co&#9472;O covalency for activating lattice oxygen and also induce tensile strain as an oxygen pump for regenerating lattice oxygen. The corresponding AEMWE yielded a cutting&#8208;edge current of 3.4 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V and remarkable stability with imperceptible degradation of 0.09&#160;mV h&#8722;1 in 1200&#160;h. This work opens up a feasible avenue for developing targeted catalysts under operating conditions by finely tuning the long&#8208;range disorder during reconstruction.

&lt;p&gt;The long-range disorder of dynamically reconstructed Co-based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is finely localized by fluoride-mediated stabilization of lattice Co sites during reconstruction. The localized long-range disorder efficiently promotes Co&#9472;O covalency and induces tensile strain, leading to balanced activation and regeneration of lattice oxygen for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the long-range disorder of dynamically reconstructed nanostructures represents a challenging but important approach for achieving practical catalysts with high performance. Here, we report a facile fluoride-mediated-stabilization strategy to finely localize the long-range disorder of reconstructed amorphous Co-based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions with compatible lattice-oxygen activation and regeneration for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). The stabilized lattice Co by fluoride-induced bond reinforcing in pre-catalysts enabled localized long-range disorder of reconstructed amorphous oxyhydroxides. The localized long-range disorder can promote Co&#9472;O covalency for activating lattice oxygen and also induce tensile strain as an oxygen pump for regenerating lattice oxygen. The corresponding AEMWE yielded a cutting-edge current of 3.4 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0&#160;V and remarkable stability with imperceptible degradation of 0.09&#160;mV h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 1200&#160;h.

         <title>Topology Regulation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers for Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers. Thus, distinct topological arrangements lead to orders of magnitude differences in photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers, especially those with a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, are emerging as potent photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, even constructed with identical D&#8211;A building blocks, conjugated polymers with diverse topologies can yield distinct photocatalytic properties, underscoring the significance of topology regulation. Herein, two conjugated polymers, Bi&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A2 motif and Tri&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A3 motif, were designed with identical building blocks, and synthesized via a low&#8208;energy, rapid sonochemical method to investigate the influence of topologies on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Comprehensive theoretical calculations and femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy reveal that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of the D&#8211;A conjugated polymer. Specifically, Bi&#8208;CBTP achieves a rather high hydrogen production rate of 516.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 as the state&#8208;of&#8208;art performance under simulated solar irradiation, along with a 61.2% apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420&#160;nm. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular electronics is confronted with a fundamental challenge: balancing interfacial coupling strength. Strong coupling enhances mechanical stability but often reduces conductivity, whereas weak coupling favors high conductance yet compromises structural integrity. We solve this by integrating both strong and weak coupling modalities within a single&#8208;molecule architecture, achieving programmable ternary switching and memory with ON/OFF ratios &gt;102 and 950&#160;Hz frequency&#8212;setting a new performance benchmarkin molecular&#8208;scale electronic devices.








Abstract
Advances in molecular electronics focus on developing miniaturized electronic devices by leveraging molecules as fundamental building blocks. This approach exploits the unique structural properties of molecules and the robustness of their interfacial interactions with electrodes to achieve enhanced functionalities at the nanoscale. Achieving optimal balance between strong and weak interfacial couplings in molecular&#8208;scale devices to reconcile competing performance and stability requirements remains a significant scientific challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid coupling strategy utilizing multichannel parallel circuits to integrate the stability of strong coupling with the high&#8208;energy molecular orbitals of weak coupling. Through precise mechanical modulation of interfacial coupling, we demonstrate programmable ternary switching and storage devices, achieving On/Off ratios exceeding 102 and switching frequencies up to 950&#160;Hz via tip manipulation experiments. This investigation illuminates the complex dynamics of interfacial coupling in molecular devices and proposes a promising approach to optimize device stability and functionality by harmonizing strong and weak coupling in multichannel parallel circuits.

         <title>Tuning the Adsorption of H and OH on Ruthenium Aerogel to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Ru hetero&#8208;phases (fcc/hcp) combined with Cr ions doping effectively weakens the strong adsorption of OH and H species on Ru sites. This modulation of adsorption energetics exposes more active Ru centers, thereby significantly enhancing the alkaline HER activity of the Ru aerogel.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is an ideal alternative to platinum for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its exceptional catalytic performance. However, during the reaction, the excessively strong adsorption of proton (H) and hydroxyl (OH) species on Ru significantly limits its alkaline HER activity. Herein, we enhanced the alkaline HER performance of Ru by modulating its crystalline phase structure and incorporating a low dosage of Cr ions. The synthesized Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel exhibits a lower overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming Ru aerogels (Rufcc and Ruhcp) and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel demonstrates a remarkable stability at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, sustaining continuous operation for 800&#160;h. Experimental results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the heterogeneous phase interfaces in the CrRufcc/hcp aerogel effectively weaken the strong adsorption of H at Ru sites. Additionally, with their high affinity for OH species, Cr ions facilitate the removal of OH from adjacent Ru sites. Furthermore, Cr ion incorporation modifies the local electronic structure of Ru, further reducing its OH adsorption energy. This work highlights a synergistic approach to improving catalytic performance and offers a novel strategy for designing highly efficient and durable alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>Interrupting the Hydroxide Enrichment&#8208;Induced Electrode Degradation Loop for Achieving Stable Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper utilizes an electrolyte additive to dynamically interrupt the OH&#8722; crossover&#8208;induced electrode degradation and polyiodide formation. Moreover, it builds water&#8208;deficient electric double layers (EDLs) and forms a ZnS&#8208;rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), constrains OH&#8722;, and captures polyiodides at the cathode to simultaneously boost the aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery.








Abstract
Severe adverse reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, lead to short lifetimes of rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries and have aroused widespread attention. However, few studies have specifically investigated the impact of hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) disturbance generated by side reactions on the Zn anode and I2 cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a facile electrolyte additive strategy was introduced to break the OH&#8722; enrichment&#8208;induced bidirectional electrode degradation loop toward achieving stable Zn&#8208;I2 cells. Particularly, the bidirectional additive restricts the crossover of OH&#8722;, suppressing the iodine hydrolysis reaction&#8208;induced polyiodide formation and capturing polyiodides to prevent shuttling. It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn&#8208;I2 cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&#8722;2. The concept of bi&#8208;directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The concept of bi-directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Nitroso/Hydroxylamine Redox Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Cathodes in Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>

N&#9552;O/NHOH redox chemistry, inspired by biological processes, enables proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron storage with high voltage and fast kinetics, providing a blueprint for high&#8208;capacity organic cathode materials for aqueous proton batteries.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials are emerging candidates for aqueous proton batteries due to their structural tunability and sustainability. However, the simultaneous realization of high voltage, low solubility, and high capacity remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce a biomimetic redox pair, nitroso/hydroxylamine (&#9472;N&#9552;O &#8652; &#9472;NH&#9472;OH), for the first time in energy storage systems. We report 1&#8208;(hydroxyamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (NHOH&#8208;A), a rationally designed aromatic hydroxylamine compound capable of undergoing a highly reversible proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron redox process. Benefiting from its strong hydrogen bonding, uniform charge distribution, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, NHOH&#8208;A delivers a high discharge voltage of 1.15&#160;V, excellent capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1, and remarkable cyclability (&gt; 13,000 cycles) when coupled with a Zn anode. Furthermore, leveraging its intrinsic proton&#8208;donating capability, we construct a rocking&#8208;chair type all&#8208;organic proton battery by pairing NHOH&#8208;A with an alloxazine anode. The full cell maintains 164 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C (1 C = 224&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and delivers an energy density of 125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, among the highest for all&#8208;organic proton batteries. This work establishes the N&#9552;O/NHOH chemistry as a promising redox platform, opening new avenues for developing advanced organic cathodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Highly Stable &#960;&#8209;Extended Viologen Functionalized Hybrid Lead Halides for Near Infrared&#8208;Driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly stable viologen&#8208;functionalized lead iodide framework featuring strong UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR absorption extending up to 965&#160;nm, achieving record&#8208;high NIR&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 photoconversion. The intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor architecture, combined with excellent carrier mobility in lead iodide layers, facilitates photoinduced charge separation and directs electrons toward adjacent N radical sites, effectively promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling for selective C2 product formation.








Abstract
Hybrid lead halides show great potential for CO2 photoreduction owing to their structural tunability and excellent photophysical properties. However, their intrinsic instability and the suppressed efficiency of C&#8211;C coupling under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation highlight the significant challenges of developing a stable, single&#8208;component photocatalyst with efficient NIR utilization. Herein, we incorporate &#960;&#8208;extended viologen units into two hybrid lead halides via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, forming intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) configurations. Dimensional modulation from 1D to 2D extends the NIR absorption to 965&#160;nm, affording a narrow bandgap of 1.28&#160;eV. The inherent D&#8211;A system, combined with excellent carrier mobility of lead halides, promotes efficient electron migration from the lead halide components to the viologen moieties, generating stable N&#8208;radical species. The resultant single&#8208;component photocatalyst achieves selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with high apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of 0.81% at 700(&#177;15)&#160;nm and 0.38% at 800(&#177;15)&#160;nm, exceeding typical NIR&#8208;responsive photocatalysts that typically generate C1 products. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the accumulated carriers enhance *CO intermediate formation on adjacent N radical sites with close proximity (&#8764;4.7&#160;&#197;), promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling. This work presents an effective strategy for utilizing low&#8208;energy NIR light and drive CO2 conversion to high&#8208;value C2 hydrocarbons, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance metal halide photocatalysts.

Atomically dispersed transition metal modified Pt&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized via the ALD method, which are used to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of Ni and Fe against Pt in methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction, which was achieved by combining microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, DFT calculations. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited optimal activity and the lowest activation energies, attributed to moderate electronic modification against Pt.








Abstract
The electronic effects of bimetallic components in catalysis remain poorly understood. Herein, atomically dispersed transition metal (TM) modified platinum (Pt)&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized with the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Methanol steam reforming (MSR) was selected as a probe reaction to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) on Pt species. In situ/ex situ characterizations, isotope labeling, and DFT calculations reveal that different transition metals and ALD cycles tune the Pt electronic structure, significantly affecting catalytic activity. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits optimal electronic modification, achieving the highest MSR and water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) conversions and the lowest activation energies. Additionally, kinetic isotope effect studies confirm that hydrogen formation proceeds via methanol dehydrogenation coupled with WGS. These findings provide new insights into electronic modifications at atomic scales within the bimetallic components, offering valuable guidance for the design and development of advanced catalytic systems.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Driven Organelle Cross&#8208;Linking Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that respectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, achieving precise spatial manipulation at the organelle level through molecular recognition. This approach selectively induced abnormal ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections and ultimately led to strong immunogenic cell death. This supramolecular recognition&#8208;based strategy provides a new perspective for precision medicine.








Abstract
Organelles maintain cellular homeostasis through highly specialized division of labor, dynamic interactions, as well as extensive inter&#8208;organellar information exchange, thereby ensuring the physiological functions of organisms. Although functionalized polymers that target a specific organelle to modulate or disrupt their function have been developed for therapeutic applications, macromolecular systems capable of manipulating two or more types of key organelles remain rare. Here, we designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that can respectively target endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, to achieve precise spatial manipulation of both organelles at the subcellular organelle level via a specific molecular recognition approach. This approach selectively induced unusual junctions between the ER and mitochondria, disrupting their functional synergy, triggering multiple cellular stress responses, such as Ca2+ homeostasis imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, energy metabolism disorder, and ultimately leading to severe immunogenic cell death (ICD). By converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, this strategy provides a supramolecular perspective for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Photocatalytic Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Single&#8208;Atom Skeletal Editing</title>

Acridinium&#8208;based COFs (Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB) are synthesized via a single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement from xanthylium precursors. The resulting COFs possess high crystallinity, stability, redox activity, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB serves as an efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. 








Abstract
The rational synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with customized functionalities and enhanced stability requires innovative bond&#8208;forming strategies beyond conventional dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;atom skeletal editing approach to construct acridinium&#8208;based crystalline COFs through an irreversible Katritzky&#8208;type reaction. This strategy enables precise transformation of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;(2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylxanthylium) with either 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8201;(TAPB)&#8201;or&#8201;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TADB) into acridinium&#8208;linked COFs, denoted as Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB, respectively. The transformation proceeds via a unique single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement, converting the xanthylium precursor into acridinium frameworks. The resulting COFs exhibit high crystallinity, robust stability, strong redox ability, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB functions as a highly effective metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, supporting gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. This work establishes skeletal editing as a powerful strategy for engineering functionalized COF architectures for advanced applications.

         <title>Defects Induced in Situ Reconstruction of CdS with Oxygen&#8208;Tolerance Up to 23% in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective CdS&#8208;D showed superior oxygen tolerance than traditional CdS, maintaining a stable CO generation rate of 2.77&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 23% O2 (matching pure CO2 conditions). Defect&#8208;induced hole accumulation triggered oxidative reconstruction to active Cd2SO4(OH)2, enhancing CO2 adsorption and suppressing O2 adsorption, thus enabling high oxygen resistance.








Abstract
Direct driving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 from air or flue gas to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is very challenging due to the suppressing effect of the more favorable thermodynamically oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we presented a novel oxygen&#8208;involved reconstruction pathway on a unique defective CdS&#8208;D in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The material is highly tolerant to O2 and generates 2766.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of CO under visible light irradiation in the presence of up to 23% content of O2. Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the performance of CO2 reduction, the presence of oxygen positively promotes it, CO generation rate is up to 5124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after multiple experimental cycles. The meticulously structural analysis reveals that the CdS&#8208;D with abundant defects tended to accumulate photogenerated holes, and S2&#8722; is oxidized to SO42&#8722; in the presence of oxygen to produce Cd2SO4(OH)2 as the active center for preferable CO2 adsorption and inhibit the O2 adsorption, which is the root cause for the high tolerance of oxygen in CO2 reduction (CO2RR). This work reveals a unique reconstruction process of sulfides photo corrosion, which provides a new idea for realizing the direct conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 by omitting expensive carbon capture or purification in industrial carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Cu Evolution over Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta Zeolite Under H2 and Ethanol Atmospheres: Unveiling the Role of Diatomic Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between isolated Cu(II) and Y(III) sites in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts increase the energy barrier for Cu(II) reduction under H2 atmosphere at high temperature, contributing to distinct induction period during ethanol dehydrogenation compared with monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the dynamic evolution of Cu species under varying environmental conditions is critical for addressing challenges related to the activity and the stability of copper&#8208;based catalysts in thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electrocatalysis. However, metal&#8211;metal interactions between dual single atoms and their effects on Cu evolution after exposure to different environmental molecules remain underexplored. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts with dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts with isolated Cu sites in dealuminated Beta zeolites. By varying Cu and Y compositions, diatomic interactions were studied under H2 and ethanol atmospheres. With 6 wt% Y loading, approximately 0.4 wt% of Cu species in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta remained partially oxidized as Cu(I) after reduction in pure H2 at 350 &#176;C, in contrast to the full transition to metallic Cu observed in Cu&#8208;Beta. Combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with kinetic studies revealed that metallic Cu became the predominant species after reduction with H2 as Cu loading increased from 0.4 to 1.7 wt%, quadrupling the initial ethanol dehydrogenation rate and demonstrating the dominant role of Cu(0) sites. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory simulations indicated spatial proximity between dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and elucidated Cu speciation controlled by diatomic interactions.

         <title>Organic Ion&#8208;Mediated Electrostatic Shielding Facilitates Membrane&#8208;Free Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with LiFePO4 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free electrolysis is developed that synergistically integrates hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries. The redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl enables efficient electron transfer from LFP. An electrostatic shielding mechanism is employed by adding polyquaternium&#8208;7 to the electrolyte. This approach effectively minimizes the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by repelling them electrostatically from the electrode surface.








Abstract
Electrolytic water splitting is a cornerstone technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production. However, conventional methods face substantial challenges due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limitations imposed by ion&#8208;exchange membranes, highlighting the need for innovative approaches. This study introduces a novel, membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system that synergistically combines hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Central to this system is the redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (4&#8208;HO&#8208;TEMPO), which facilitates electron transfer from LFP. To mitigate parasitic reactions in the absence of a membrane, an electrostatic shielding mechanism is implemented through the addition of polyquaternium&#8208;7 (PQ&#8208;7) to the electrolyte. This strategy effectively suppresses the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by electrostatically repelling them from the electrode surface, as evidenced by rotating disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The proposed system achieves a remarkable hydrogen faradic efficiency of 92.4% and facilitates lithium ion recycling at a rate of 54.45&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Our work presents a straightforward yet effective strategy for membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis integrated with the sustainable recycling of spent LFP batteries through interfacial microenvironment control.

To mitigate parasitic reactions in the absence of a membrane, an electrostatic shielding mechanism is implemented through the addition of polyquaternium-7 (PQ-7) to the electrolyte. This strategy effectively suppresses the unwanted reduction of redox-active species by electrostatically repelling them from the electrode surface, as evidenced by rotating disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The proposed system achieves a remarkable hydrogen faradic efficiency of 92.4% and facilitates lithium ion recycling at a rate of 54.45&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work presents a straightforward yet effective strategy for membrane-free water electrolysis integrated with the sustainable recycling of spent LFP batteries through interfacial microenvironment control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Catalysts based on earth abundant cobalt {as cationic [LCoI]+} and readily available ligands are practical alternatives to prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;catalysts for intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes. Tunable phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligands enable an alternate intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition mode in 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. A mechanism that involves a cobaltacycle formed via intramolecular oxidative dimerization of the precursors is proposed.








Abstract
Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions have been extensively used for the syntheses of biologically active compounds including natural products. We have identified Co(I) complexes and optimal reaction conditions to accomplish highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. These catalysts, readily prepared from an earth&#8208;abundant metal and tunable ligands, serve as practical replacements for the prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;complexes previously used for similar reactions. The cationic complexes are readily prepared by the reaction of LCoX2 with Zn in the presence of NaBARF. Both neutral and cationic Co(I)&#8208;complexes of (S)&#8208;BINAP and (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINAP ligands effect the cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes giving the expected [4+2]&#8208;addition products in excellent selectivities. The [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of the less reactive 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes proceed only with the cationic complexes and 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;[(2S,5S)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane (PhBPE) and appropriately substituted phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) are the most optimal ligands for these reactions. Depending on the ligands, 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes bearing an aromatic substituent at the terminal position undergo an intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, giving cyclobutane products in very good yields and enantioselectivities. The absence of the corresponding [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition in the 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;yne substates may be related to the enhanced strain in the expected bicyclo[3.2.0]heptene products. A unified mechanism involving Co(I)/Co(III)&#8208;redox cycle, consistent with all available evidence, is proposed for these reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Stereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Sulfinylamines with Allenes</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides is reported, wherein the allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes is demonstrated to proceed with broad substrate scope, accompanied by excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Sulfinamides, pivotal scaffolds in modern organic synthesis, have undergone a continuous evolution of synthetic methodologies over the past century, yet the precise construction of sulfur stereocenters remains a significant synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a versatile catalytic asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides through the direct allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes. Our methodology employs a catalytic system comprising copper salts, hydrosilanes, and readily accessible chiral ligands, which facilitates the in situ generation of organocopper surrogates via hydrocupration of allenes. This approach demonstrates remarkable substrate scope and excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity across a diverse array of sulfinamide products. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations, including detailed experimental studies and computational analyses, have been conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway and identify the key factors governing enantioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H Functionalization of Nitramines for Accessing Bifunctional Energetic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H functionalization of nitramines enables the synthesis of molecules containing bifunctional energetic heterocycles with promising properties. A telescoped, HNO3&#8208;free sequence involving nitration and azolation steps offers a safer, modular, and scalable platform for the synthesis of energetic compounds.








Abstract
The synthesis of energetic materials (EMs) often involves hazardous reagents and harsh conditions, raising safety and environmental concerns. We herein present an electrochemical method for the &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H azolation of nitramines, enabling the integration of nitramines and various nitrogen&#8208;rich azoles as dual energetic components within the same molecule. To enhance the practicality of the overall synthesis, we developed a tandem two&#8208;step process that transforms free amines into nitramines using stable and readily available reagents, which was complemented by subsequent electrochemical azolation to complete a streamlined, scalable preparation of bifunctional energetic compounds. Finally, a continuous flow system was employed to further improve the practicality of the electrosynthetic method, which substantially reduced electrolyte usage and increased productivity. Computational and experimental data revealed that the introduction of azoles, particularly those with additional nitro substituents, improves the energy density and thermal stability of nitramines. This work provides a proof of concept that the reported electrochemical azolation reaction may not only offer a safer and more sustainable alternative to traditional approaches for energetic material synthesis, but it will also provide a platform for the discovery of novel compounds with favorable energetic properties.

         <title>Molecular Locking in Triplet Sensitization Amplifies Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular geometry matters: We employ nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots to sensitize triplet fusion upconversion, achieving a 43&#8208;fold CPL amplification and high upconversion efficiency. DFT simulation reveals that the record glum originates from the structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during triplet sensitization, maximizing the magnetic dipole moment.








Abstract
The potential of chiral organic molecules exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) for practical applications hinges on the luminescence efficiency and dissymmetry factor (glum). However, surpassing the molecular limitations of dissymmetry factors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the different parity selection rules governing the electric and magnetic dipole moments in chiral molecules. In this study, we tackle this inherent constraint by designing a triplet sensitization photon upconversion system using nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) photosensitizer. We demonstrate a 43&#8208;fold amplification of CPL in QD&#8208;sensitized triplet fusion process compared to the direct photoexcitation. Notably, a high green&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion quantum efficiency of 12.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% (normalized to 100%) was achieved. The dissymmetry factors of QD&#8208;sensitized upconversion CPL outperform previous reports based on molecular photosensitizers. The observed large glum, according to our modeling and first&#8208;principles calculations, originates from the unique structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during the ultrafast triplet energy transfer process. Our work provides a new strategy and mechanistic insights for CPL amplification through triplet sensitization.

         <title>EII/EIVO (E&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn) Catalyzed Nitrous Oxide Activation and Chemodivergent Reduction of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent germanium and tin redox catalysis: Catalytic N2O activation at an EII/EIVO redox platform was reported using carbodiphosphorane&#8208;ligated germylene and stannylene as catalysts. Notably, the SnII&#8208;catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes, mediated by a SnII/SnIVO redox cycling, demonstrates excellent selectivity and enables the synthesis of four distinct reduced products under mild conditions.








Abstract
While homogeneous catalysis remains predominantly dominated by transition metal complexes, the utilization of main group compounds as redox catalysts for diverse chemical transformations represents a long&#8208;sought yet underexplored frontier. This work reports the catalytic reduction of N2O in the presence of HBpin via an unprecedented EII/EIVO (E&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn) redox platform, employing carbodiphosphorane ligated germylene or stannylene as the catalyst. The key GeIV and SnIV&#8208;oxo intermediates have been isolated and characterized. Furthermore, we extend this redox platform to achieve efficient and chemodivergent reduction of nitroarenes under mild conditions. Notably, through systematic modulation of reaction conditions, four different reduced products including amino, hydroxylamine, azoxy, and hydrazine derivatives can be synthesized from nitroarenes with high yields and selectivity. This work establishes a novel heavy group 14 element&#8208;based catalytic manifold and unlocks new opportunities for the application of heavy carbene analogues in redox catalysis.

         <title>Formation of Interconnected Nanofiber Sheets by Chemical Vapor Polymerization at the Free Surface of Liquid Crystalline Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation of a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional interconnected amine functionalized nanofiber network at a gas&#8211;liquid crystal interface by chemical vapor polymerization. The network forms via an interfacial phase separation pathway, revealing that the range of morphologies accessible via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystal is much greater than previously understood.








Abstract
We report that chemical vapor polymerization (CVP) of aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane into nematic liquid crystal (LC) films (thicknesses of 18&#160;&#181;m) yields quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional, sub&#8208;micron thick nanoporous polymer networks consisting of interconnected amine&#8208;functionalized nanofibers/nanowalls (widths of 30&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;nm). We establish that the polymer networks form at the free surface of the LC films with thicknesses ranging from 79&#160;&#177;&#160;5 to 280&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;nm and nanoscopic pores tunable via the choice of LC and monomer loading. Structural analysis using electron microscopy reveals the networks to possess morphologies ranging from open bicontinuous&#8208;like to cellular foam&#8208;like structures which, along with optical observations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, supports a synthesis pathway involving an interface&#8208;confined phase separation. MD simulations provide further insight into the atomic&#8208;scale processes determining the synthesis pathway, including the role of reactive precursor chemistry (e.g., hydroxymethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus [2.2]paracyclophane) in defining the nanostructure of the polymer product. Fluorescence and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm that the nanofiber sheets are decorated with primary amine groups, permitting covalent functionalization of the surfaces of the nanosheets. Finally, we show how the nanosheet synthesis can be integrated with existing membrane technology, illustrating the potential utility of the nanoporous sheets in a range of contexts, including filters, separators, and heat exchanger surfaces.

         <title>Synergistic Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis and Photocatalysis via TiO2@PTFE Composites for Efficient N2 to NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step synthesized TiO2@PTFE catalyst integrates contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis with photocatalysis, achieving 133.6 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 NH3 production under mild conditions. The synergy arises from improved dispersion, electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven charge separation, Fermi&#8208;level upshift, and enhanced N2 adsorption. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm dual&#8208;field&#8208;driven activation, providing a sustainable pathway for efficient nitrogen fixation and advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Catalytic nitrogen fixation from N2 and water under mild conditions offers a sustainable NH3 synthesis route. Herein, we report a synergistic nitrogen fixation strategy combining contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) with photocatalysis via one&#8208;step in situ hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 @PTFE catalyst, and achieved an activity of 133.6 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. It represents 10.9&#8208;fold and 7.5&#8208;fold enhancements over pristine TiO2 and PTFE, respectively, outperforming current CEC systems and many photocatalytic systems operating without sacrificial agents. Further characterization and theoretical calculations reveal the synergy: the composite catalyst enhances the CEC catalyst dispersion; the CEC&#8208;generated electric fields promote photogenerated charge separation and elevate the semiconductor's Fermi level, bolstering photocatalytic N2 reduction; conversely, the semiconductor boosts CEC efficiency via enhanced N2 adsorption and supplemental electron donation. We anticipate that this work establishes a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, providing novel insights into CEC&#8208;photocatalysis synergy and a pathway for rational design of high&#8208;performance nitrogen fixation catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Cascade Reaction Efficiency by Local pH Regulation for Integrated Anodic H2O2 Generation and Ammoximation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for efficient oxime synthesis. By regulating the local pH through electrolyte engineering, the system achieves 81% electron efficiency (EE) and 98% H2O2 utilization, offering a generalizable strategy for cascade electrochemical&#8211;chemical processes.








Abstract
Cascade reaction strategies integrating electrochemistry with chemical transformations offer routes for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the efficiencies of such integrated processes get compromised due to competitive electrochemical reactions and incompatibility between electrochemical and chemical transformations. We report an integrated electrochemical&#8211;chemical coupling of anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for oxime synthesis. An FTO/Sb2WO6 anode was designed and optimized to anodically produce H2O2 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87%. H2O2 from the anode oxidizes NH3 to NH2OH, which subsequently reacts with cyclohexanone to yield cyclohexanone oxime with 99% selectivity and a maximum electron efficiency (EE) of 81%. Continuous and adjustable H2O2 input ensures synchronization with the ammonia oxidation reaction while minimizing over&#8208;oxidation of the reaction intermediates. Operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) revealed local pH shifts caused by the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and its effect on the FE of H2O2 synthesis and competing NH3 oxidation, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing the reaction microenvironment. By regulating the electrolyte composition to modulate the interfacial pH, side reactions were suppressed and H2O2 generation was promoted, thereby enhancing cascade selectivity. This work highlights local pH regulation as a tool to improve reaction compatibility and efficiency in cascade electrosynthesis.

         <title>Fluorophenyl and Trifluoromethylphenyl Terminal Groups: Enabling BT.2020&#8208;Targeted Narrowband Green Emission in High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically fusing diboron&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks with dibenzo[b,d]furan units and introducing fluorine&#8208;containing units as terminal substituents, highly efficient narrowband pure green&#8208;emitting multiple resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials can be developed, with precisely controlled emission peaks while maintaining a narrow full width at half maximum.








Abstract
To meet the critical demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) display technology, luminescent materials must achieve precise peak emission positions and narrow emission bandwidths simultaneously. Herein, we report a new class of narrowband pure green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3. These compounds are constructed on diborane&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeletons fused with a dibenzo[b,d]furan motif. Through strategic incorporation of three distinct terminal substituents, 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units, we further precisely modulate emission maxima while maintaining narrowband emission characteristics. All of these emitters exhibit bright green luminescence and narrowband emission characteristics, with luminescence peaks ranging from 513 to 518&#160;nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is only 14 to 16&#160;nm in dilute toluene solution. Additionally, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for all of these emitters exceed 95%. The corresponding optimized OLEDs based on DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3 achieved peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 33.7%, 32.4%, and 32.0%, respectively. The CIEy coordinates for these OLEDs were 0.74, 0.75, and 0.75, with FWHM values ranging from 18.5 to 19.4&#160;nm. To the best of my knowledge, the EQEs, FWHM, and CIEy values represent some of the most exceptional performance metrics reported in the current literature.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed O&#8208;Alkylisourea&#8208;Enabled Electrochemical Radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel electrochemical protocol for the deoxygenative arylation of bench&#8208;stable O&#8208;alkylisoureas as C(sp3) radical precursors via reductive activation. Combined with nickel catalysis, this methodology enables the deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of alcohol derivatives with a wide range of aryl electrophiles, offering a mild and efficient electrochemical strategy for C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods to employ naturally abundant alcohol derivatives as C(sp3) precursors for deoxygenative carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;coupling holds significant value for expanding sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space. While progress has been made in this area, the field lacks readily accessible, bench&#8208;stable alkylation reagents capable of undergoing reductive activation to generate alkyl radicals. Herein, we report an electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed system for efficient C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) radical cross&#8208;coupling between aryl electrophiles (halides, triflates, tosylates, and boronic acids) and O&#8208;alkylisoureas as radical progenitors. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. Its synthetic utility is highlighted through the preparation of beclobrate analogs and bifonazole, as well as late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations support a radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Dual Spatial and Electronic Regulation in van der Waals Cu3Se2 Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3Se2 NSs are synthesized via chemical vapor transport and electrochemical exfoliation and feature in&#8208;plane Cu&#9472;Se frameworks and layered van der Waals structure. Spatial confinement and Cu 3d&#8211;Se 4p hybridization synergistically modulate Cu active sites, enabling &#960;&#8208;activation of acetylene, efficient H* utilization, and 90.6% FEethylene at 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability. 








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are promising for electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation to sustainable ethylene production, yet conventional catalysts suffer from a dilemma: contiguous Cu ensembles induce C&#9472;C coupling, while isolated Cu atoms on electronegative supports cause over&#8208;polarization and competing hydrogen evolution reaction, limiting selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene. Here, we report atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals Cu3Se2 nanosheets featuring a unique Cu&#9472;Se coordination that enables simultaneous spatial confinement and electronic modulation of Cu sites. The catalyst delivers a FEethylene over 90% at a current density of 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains &gt;90% FE for 25&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial and advanced Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies show that Cu 3d&#8208;Se 4p orbital hybridization tailors the density of states and d&#8208;band center, facilitating &#960;&#8208;orbital activation of acetylene, boosting active hydrogen utilization, and reducing the hydrogenation barrier. Simultaneously, it raises energy barriers for C&#9472;C coupling and H* recombination, suppressing C4 and H2 byproducts. This work positions van der Waals Cu3Se2 as a robust platform for selective ethylene production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Dual Formate Electrosynthesis via Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation and CO2 Reduction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>

This study optimized CuxAg10&#8722;x catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration&#8208;dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&#8722; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO2RR achieved dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO3RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
Electrochemical formate (HCOO&#8722;) production via CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise for carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu3Ag7 catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&#8722; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;VRHE. When coupled with CO2RR, the FOR||CO2RR system enabled dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production, achieving a total HCOO&#8722; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&#8722; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy&#8208;efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.

The optimal Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. When coupled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, the FOR||CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR system enabled dual-side HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production, achieving a total HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultra-low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy-efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable and Programmable Al8 Macrocycles for Advanced Dielectrics: Uniting High Permittivity, Minimal Loss, and Robust Moisture Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tunable macrocycles surface engineering, we developed solution&#8208;processable aluminum molecular ring (Al8)&#8208;based dielectric materials. Guided by theoretical calculations, the metal center engineering strategy significantly improved material synthesis efficiency. The designed Al8&#8208;based materials effectively addressed critical issues of conventional Al2O3 fillers, including interfacial hydrolysis and uneven polarization, achieving synergistic optimization of high permittivity, low loss, and superior moisture resistance.








Abstract
The development of polymer composite dielectrics exhibiting high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and excellent environmental stability is essential for enhancing field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) performance and reliability. While conventional high&#8208;&#954; materials like Al2O3 suffer from surface hydrolysis&#8208;induced polarization inhomogeneity, we present herein a molecular engineering solution through solution&#8208;processable and structurally programmable Al8 macrocycles. By employing computationally guided metal center and macrocycle surface engineering, we achieved highly efficient synthesis of solution&#8208;processable Al8&#8208;based dielectric materials. The resulting series of 10 structurally programmed Al8 macrocycles creates tailored electronic microenvironments, delivering exceptional dielectric properties: a threefold enhancement in dielectric constant compared to pure polymer matrices, remarkably low dielectric loss (tan &#948; = 0.064), and superior humidity resistance versus conventional Al2O3 fillers. This work establishes a comprehensive materials paradigm that simultaneously optimizes the critical dielectric parameters (&#954;, tan &#948;, and moisture resistance) while demonstrating the versatility of cluster molecular design.

         <title>Converting Residual Unstable PbI2 into Robust 2D Perovskite via Spacer Cation Engineering Toward Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering is developed, which stabilizes grain boundaries and thus improves device operational stability. The p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted devices incorporating guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) fulfill a champion efficiency of 26.19%, maintaining 92% of their initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation.








Abstract
Addressing light instability challenges induced by residual PbI2 is essential for simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency and excellent stability. Herein, we report an effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering. The guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) as additive or interface modifier is used to modulate perovskite films, converting residual PbI2 at grain boundaries (GBs) into stable 2D perovskites, which suppresses the photodecomposition of perovskite films, inhibits ion migration and thus stabilizes GBs. The formation of 2D perovskites can result in reduced defect density and facilitated carrier transport and extraction, thereby mitigating carrier nonradiative recombination. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating GUFCl achieve a champion efficiency of 26.19% with significantly improved operational stability. The unencapsulated inverted PSC maintains 92% of its initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point (MPP) continuous tracking. This work provides a simple yet effective method to solve the residual PbI2&#8208;induced intrinsic instability issue, aiming to realize efficient, operationally stable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and versatile strategy for surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization (PTD&#8208;SIP), which employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) as a phase&#8208;transfer agent. This approach enables the surface&#8208;initiated polymerization of hydrophobic monomers in a pure aqueous phase, allowing precise synthesis of hydrophobic polymer brushes with different topologies and tunable physicochemical properties of material surface and interface.








Abstract
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes hold significant potential in antifouling, energy, medical, and lubrication applications. Because of rigorous polymerization conditions and requirements of organic solvents, research on hydrophobic polymer brushes is limited. Herein, we report a simple but efficient surface&#8208;initiated polymerization technique based on phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered hydrophobic monomers (named PTD&#8208;SIP) that enables generally grafting hydrophobic brushes using minimal chemicals in an oxygen&#8208;tolerant environment with high end&#8208;group reactivity. This method employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CD) as a transport carrier to deliver hydrophobic monomers in water, eliminating the need for organic solvents. The PTD&#8208;SIP method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers and is applicable to various substrates and monomer types. Furthermore, reversible structural color has been achieved through rewritable surface&#8208;grafted polymer brushes, while permanent inorganic hybrid coatings provided expanded opportunities for applications in optics and tribology. These features make water&#8208;based hydrophobic polymer brushes a powerful tool for developing high&#8208;performance interfacial materials.

         <title>Unlocking Cryogenic Flexibility in Organic Crystals via Photoinduced E&#8594;Z Isomerization</title>

Organic crystals based on acylhydrazone derivatives fracture upon immersion in liquid nitrogen. After UV irradiation, they exhibit remarkable elastic bending at 77&#160;K. This strategy unlocks cryogenic elasticity in organic crystals.








Abstract
Dynamic tuning of mechanical properties in organic crystals remains a major challenge due to their intrinsic brittleness and rigidity, especially at cryogenic temperatures. Herein, we report the first example of light&#8208;induced cryogenic elasticity in organic molecular crystals via photoactivated E&#8594;Z isomerization. Crystals of a photoresponsive acylhydrazone derivative (NPH) undergo surface&#8208;localized isomerization upon 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, inducing partial surface melting while maintaining internal crystallinity. This remote, postsynthetic modulation dramatically enhances mechanical compliance, enabling irradiated crystals to exhibit elastic deformation and photomechanical bending even in liquid nitrogen (77&#160;K)&#8212;whereas nonirradiated crystals fracture upon immersion, with only the fragments retaining photomechanical activity. This work represents a breakthrough in mechanically reconfigurable molecular crystals and establishes a generalizable strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials operable in extreme environments. These findings open new avenues for the development of cryogenic actuators, adaptive optical systems, and low&#8208;temperature flexible electronics.

Rh single&#8208;cluster catalysts were designed for efficient thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. An unprecedented TOFRh of 595.2 h&#8722;1 with 95.3% ethanol selectivity and 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 ethanol yield was achieved over RhSC/CN. Mechanisms revealed by extensive characterizations and simulations demonstrate that Rh4 single&#8208;clusters facilitate efficient coupling of CH3* with CO* and benefit ethanol formation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is a promising strategy for efficient utilization of CO2. However, it remains a grand challenge to achieve a high ethanol yield due to the difficulty in accurate control of CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling under thermocatalytic reaction conditions. Herein, a precise rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;cluster catalyst on carbon nitride support (RhSC/CN) was designed for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The RhSC/CN catalyst, with an average Rh&#8211;Rh coordination number of 2.06, exhibits a record turnover frequency (TOFRh) of 595.2&#160;h&#8722;1, a high ethanol selectivity of 95.3% and an ethanol yield of 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 240&#160;&#176;C and 5.0&#160;MPa (H2/CO2&#160;=&#160;3), surpassing previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and H2/D2 isotope exchange probing experiments altogether reveal the reaction mechanism, and show that the synergetic interaction between Rh&#8211;Rh and Rh&#8211;N sites boosts CO2 adsorption and asymmetric C&#8211;C coupling between CH3* and CO* to form CH3CO*, leading to a high ethanol selectivity. This discovery provides new insights into the design of single&#8208;cluster catalysts for simultaneously promoting CO2 reactivity and ethanol&#160;selectivity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages for Ultrafast Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel metallo&#8208;cages were designed and self&#8208;assembled, exhibiting exceptional photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production. Through a bottom&#8208;up strategy, the metallo&#8208;cage were dispersed into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, achieving a record H2O2 production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported systems.








Abstract
In the realm of photocatalytic production, discrete metallo&#8208;organic cages have emerged as promising photocatalysts. However, their performance is often constrained by limited substrate accessibility and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel nonnoble metallo&#8208;cages, S1 and S2, and evaluated their photocatalytic activities. Benefit from the high structural stability, low exciton binding energy (52.9&#160;meV), ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (49.50&#160;ps), and prolonged excited&#8208;state lifetime (1, 970&#160;ps), S2 exhibits efficient charge carrier separation. In addition, a bottom&#8208;up approach was employed to disperse S2 into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, which significantly enhanced substrate accessibility and the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the addition of sodium oxalate not only optimizes charge carrier separation and utilization but also provides a kinetically favorable pathway for superoxide radical anion (&#183;O2&#8722;) generation, overcoming ORR kinetic bottlenecks. These synergistic effects culminate in a record production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported organic photocatalytic systems.

         <title>24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Single Polymer Chains Through Engineering&#8208;Compatible One&#8208;Pot Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;Hour&#8208;long afterglow from single polymer chains has been reported. The polymer chains emit an afterglow that lasts longer than 24&#160;h under ambient conditions. At &#8722;&#160;18&#160;&#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after photoexcitation cessation, making them the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymers reported to date. They can be activated by sunlight and maintain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air with potential applications in flexible displays and wearable devices.








Abstract
We report the unprecedented observation of 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) emission from single polymer chains. The polymer chains were synthesized through a straightforward engineering&#8208;compatible one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction. These polymers exhibit afterglow emissions exceeding 24&#160;h under ambient conditions through charge separation and recombination mechanisms. Remarkably, these HLA polymers can be activated by sunlight and sustain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air, rendering them suitable for practical engineering applications. Notably, the HLA is temperature&#8208;dependent, with lower temperatures substantially prolonging emission duration. At &#8722;&#160;18 &#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after ceasing photoexcitation, establishing these polymers as the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymeric materials reported to date. Moreover, the excellent processability of the 24&#8208;HLA polymers allows their facile fabrication into diverse forms including films and fibers using conventional polymer processing techniques, positioning them as promising candidates for flexible displays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Asymmetric Acetylene Activation Enables Enhanced Electrochemical Ethylene Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived Cu nanoparticles have been constructed to modulate the interfacial electron distribution to regulate the hydrogenation rate and increase both the C2H4 selectivity and the C2H2 hydrogenation activity to improve the ethylene formation kinetics. In addition, the origin of the enhanced C2H4 formation kinetics is the asymmetric C2H2 adsorption over the OD Cu&#8211;B NPs.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts with weak ethylene (C2H4) adsorption exhibit a robust ability to suppress the overhydrogenation of electrocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation (EAH), providing a green alternative for C2H4 production. However, the unsatisfactory C2H4 formation kinetics due to the sluggishness of C2H2 reactants still limit its practical application potential. Herein, borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived copper nanoparticles (OD Cu&#8211;B NPs) are designed to promote C2H2 activation and adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts deliver a partial current density of 720 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 48.33 s&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the bare OD Cu counterpart. The symmetric electron distribution of C2H2 is revealed to be broken over the Cu&#8211;borate interface, making it easier to activate and adsorb, which accounts for the lowered hydrogenation barrier and enhanced selectivity, consequently promoting C2H4 formation kinetics through the EAH process.

         <title>A Robust Heterometallic Pt2Pd2L8 Double Cage Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterometallic Pt(II)&#8211;Pd(II) quadruply interlocked cage catenane (Pt2Pd2L8) has been assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. The integration of inert Pt(II) and labile Pd(II) ions within the architecture enables facile catenation while strongly enhancing stability of the assembly.








Abstract
The combination of different metal ions in supramolecular structures can lead to the emergence of new features, such as enhanced stability, reduced symmetry, and peculiar reactivity. Mechanically interlocked architectures containing dissimilar metal ions are still scarce. Herein, we report the first example of a heterometallic, quadruply interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 cage catenane, assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. While direct complexation of the used asymmetric ligand with a mixture of Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions could yield 14 different monomeric and 576 interlocked cage products, the chosen approach allowed us to selectively obtain one PtPdL4 monomeric cage and a single Pt2Pd2L8 double cage isomer as major products, respectively, depending on the reaction conditions. In the obtained interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 structure, the kinetically inert Pt(II) ions are positioned peripherally, while the more labile Pd(II) ions are buried and interlocked within the cage interior, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The resulting catenane structure exhibits an enhanced kinetic stability, resisting disassembly in the presence of excess competitive ligands such as halide anions, unlike previously reported Pd(II) cage catenanes. Furthermore, the Pt2Pd2L8 cage binds halide anions with high affinity, enabling efficient sequestration of halides from organic substrates.

         <title>Boosting the Ionic Conductivity of Non&#8208;Aqueous Proton Electrolyte for Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

A hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized 80&#160;m H3PO4/EA electrolyte achieves the highest ionic conductivity among reported non&#8208;aqueous proton electrolytes, enabling the MoO3//AC capacitor with ultrahigh power density, extended cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability. 








Abstract
Proton batteries have emerged as promising alternatives for energy storage owing to their rapid H&#8314; transport kinetics and environmental sustainability. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;art proton batteries using aqueous acid electrolytes suffer from severe hydrogen evolution, electrode dissolution, and narrow electrochemical windows. Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could obviate these challenges, while they are typically limited by low ionic conductivity. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized non&#8208;aqueous H3PO4/EA electrolyte (80&#160;m) simultaneously achieves high ionic conductivity (21.8&#160;mS cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical stability window (2.5&#160;V), wide operational temperature range (&#8722;80 to 200&#160;&#176;C), and minimal corrosiveness. Using this electrolyte, the MoO3//AC hybrid capacitor demonstrates ultrahigh power density (13292&#160;W kg&#8722;1), extended cycling stability (10&#160;000 cycles), and unprecedented temperature adaptability (&#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C). Our findings provide fundamental insights into non&#8208;aqueous proton conduction mechanisms and establish new design principles for practical proton energy storage systems.

         <title>Si&#8722;H Activation via Dynamic Permutational Isomerism: A Ligand&#8208;Directed Route to Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled dynamic permutational isomerism in pentacoordinate silicon intermediates enables metal&#8208;free dehydrogenative Si&#9472;O coupling. The accessibility of axial hydride positions dictates whether Si&#9472;H bond activation or Si&#9472;N bond cleavage occurs, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding hydrogen release and coupling processes in silicon chemistry.








Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DHC) of hydridosilanes with silanols under metal&#8208;free conditions provides a sustainable route to Si&#9472;O bond formation. Yet, the mechanistic origin of hydrogen release in such systems has remained unclear. Here, we show that dynamic permutational isomerism of pentacoordinate silicon intermediates is a key prerequisite for Si&#9472;H activation and H2 release. Using sterically tailored diaminohydridosilanes, we demonstrate that only ligands enabling access to axial hydride configurations facilitate Si&#9472;O coupling with productive H2 elimination. In contrast, N&#8211;tert&#8208;butyl substitution locks the hydride in the equatorial position and diverts reactivity toward Si&#9472;N bond cleavage. Multinuclear variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy, combined with quantum chemical calculations, reveals an equilibrium between equatorial and axial hydride configurations, enabling Berry pseudorotation and hydrogen evolution. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H2 release in hydridosilicates and establish ligand&#8208;directed isomerism as a general design principle for selective, metal&#8208;free Si&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Sustainable Fluorinated Silicon Dielectric Design for Enhanced Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

Fluorinated silicon powder, synthesized via mild self&#8208;assembly, enhances CE Chemistry efficiency by 30&#8208;fold for dye degradation and enables noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free iodine oxidation, offering a sustainable alternative to fluoropolymers.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification (CE) has recently emerged as a powerful means of initiating interfacial chemical reactions via charge transfer. Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are frequently employed as solid dielectrics owing to their fluorine&#8208;rich surfaces, which exhibit strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics. However, their high environmental cost and poor surface modifiability hinder the broader adoption of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;chemistry (CE&#8208;Chemistry). Here, we report a low&#8208;cost and tunable dielectric alternative based on silicon powder, surface&#8208;functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains to mimic the interfacial properties of conventional fluoropolymers. Fluorinated silicon powders (F&#8208;Si) were synthesized via a mild self&#8208;assembly approach using 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The resulting F&#8208;Si powders exhibited a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in methyl orange degradation efficiency compared to unmodified silicon, and a 4&#8208;fold improvement in phenol degradation relative to size&#8208;matched FEP powder. In contrast, aggressive fluorination via piranha&#8208;assisted pretreatment (P&#8208;F&#8208;Si) induced particle aggregation and loss of CE reactivity, highlighting the importance of controlled surface engineering. Furthermore, CE&#8208;Chemistry enabled the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxidation of I&#8722; to I3&#8722;, establishing a low&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective paradigm for catalytic iodine conversion. Together, these advances provide a sustainable materials design framework for CE&#8208;Chemistry, with broad implications for scalable, green chemical transformation technologies.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Locking Strategy Enables Volatile Ether Organic Electrolytes to Achieve High&#8208;Energy Lithium Battery</title>

Molecular&#8208;locking subnanometer&#8208;nanowire gel electrolytes (SNWGE) enable high&#8208;energy Li cells from ether solutions. Three&#8208;dimensional network traps nonpolar solvent and promotes salt dissociation, yielding high ionic conductivity, wide potential window, and robust interfaces. Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells retain 88.5% (670th) and Li&#8211;air cells operate&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles. At 28.5% of commercial carbonate electrolyte cost, SNWGE offers a scalable, durable, and intrinsically safer electrolyte platform.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal batteries are constrained by safety and lifespan owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. Here, we report a synergy of molecular&#8208;locking and gelation treatment by cations&#8211;bridged polyoxometalate subnanometer nanowires (SNW), which facilitates using ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy Li metal batteries. The formed SNW&#8208;based gel electrolyte (SNWGE) exhibits continuous three&#8208;dimensional networks that effectively capture nonpolar ether electrolytes and promote the dissociation of Li salts, eliminating the risks of electrolyte leakage and volatilization. Homogeneous and continuous Li+ fast transport channels were created in the SNWGE through intermolecular interactions, contributing to sufficient ionic conductivity (1.26 mS cm&#8722;1), high oxidative stability (up to 5.0&#160;V versus Li+/Li), and good solid/cathode electrolyte interphase formation capability. The SNWGE enables the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells to reach good cyclability (over 88% capacity retention after 670 cycles), excellent low&#8208;temperature, and abuse&#8208;tolerant properties. Notably, the cost of the SNWGE is only 28.5% of the commercial electrolyte (1&#160;M lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), highlighting its significant potential for industrial application. When the SNWGE is tested in Li&#8211;air batteries, a stable cycling of&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles was obtained. The electrolyte design paves a promising path for highly energetic, durable, and safe rechargeable Li metal batteries.

         <title>Delocalized Frustrated Lewis Pairs in COF&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Transfer for Urea Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

We developed a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COF photocatalyst, where F&#8208;functionalization creates electron&#8208;delocalized Fe&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). The FLPs selectively adsorb and activate NO3&#8722; at Fe sites and CO2 at keto oxygen atoms, while enhancing charge separation and weakening Fe&#9472;N bonds to promote *NHx intermediate transfer, thereby enabling efficient photosynthesis of urea from CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;reduction. 








Abstract
Photosynthesis of urea through C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrates (NO3&#8722;) represents a sustainable route for both carbon utilization and environmental remediation, yet remains fundamentally challenging due to competing parallel reduction reactions. Building upon hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base principles, we demonstrate that electronic delocalization modulation in iron (Fe)&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) can effectively suppress these reductions while selectively promoting C&#9472;N coupling. To realize this strategy, we engineered a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (Fe/F&#9472;COF) photocatalyst, where F functionalization modulates the electronic structure to create electron&#8208;delocalized FLPs with precisely controlled Fe&#8208;keto oxygen spatial spacing at 3.4 &#197;. Experimental and computational results reveal that F&#8208;induced electron delocalization enhances Lewis acidity at Fe sites for NO3&#8722; activation and increases basicity at keto oxygen for the CO2 activation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;delocalized Fe center exhibits softened acid character that weakens the Fe&#8208;N bond in adsorbed *NH species, facilitating N&#8208;transfer for C&#9472;N coupling. Such spatial and electronic configuration lowers the C&#9472;N coupling barrier, favoring *NHCO intermediate formation and subsequent urea production. The Fe/F&#8208;COF achieves a high urea yield rate of 93 &#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 1.1% at 400 nm, surpassing most reported photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction coupling systems to date.

Remote modulation carbon's interfacial electronic properties coupling with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg (CoNiCuMnMg@C) to unleashing carbon's potential in Li&#8211;S batteries.

Abstract
Carbon materials, renowned for their exceptional intrinsic properties, play a pivotal role in the domain of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially for encasing delicate metal&#8208;based catalysts. However, this encasement hinders the precise control of catalytic capacity because carbon's inherent &#963;&#8208;bonding complicates direct changes to the material's surface atomic and electronic structure. Herein, a universal fresh perspective is reported that remotely and precisely reverse manipulation the surface electronic structure of carbon host by driving electron pumping, accumulation, Li ion diffusion and facilitate covalent interactions with polysulfides using s&#8208;d block high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (CoNiCuMnMg@C). Theoretical calculation optimization results confirm that polysulfides stabilize at the Carbon interface rather than directly at the alloy surface so as to avoid its being poisoned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and KPFM results shed light on that coupling with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg, reduces the work function and enhances the electron density signaling that an electron deviation from alloy to C (Hershfield charge of &#8722;0.34 e), which in turn enhances the electron&#8208;rich carbon's ability to strongly adsorb Li+. The CoNiCuMnMg@C catalyst boosts Li+ diffusion and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention. This novel strategy provides new horizons for high&#8208;effective catalyst design.

This work presented a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy achieved unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.0%, and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32 nm. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;efficient displays and eye&#8208;healthy lighting technologies. However, CP&#8208;OLEDs obtained from conventional chiral luminescent materials face critical limitations, including insufficient electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and broad emission bandwidths, which collectively impede their practical application. Herein, we proposed a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs. Firstly, chiral inducers (P/M&#8208;THH) were incorporated into the N&#8208;LC (2PFP) host. Subsequent thermal annealing yielded intrinsically luminescent N*&#8208;LCs films exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| up to 1.33. Introducing the achiral energy acceptor BCz&#8208;BN at optimal concentrations enabled efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (&#934;ET&#160;=&#160;99%), producing ternary co&#8208;assembled N*&#8208;LCs films. These films retained the nematic order while inheriting the narrowband emission and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of BCz&#8208;BN. This approach achieves unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum EQE of 9.0%, and narrowband electroluminescence with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. These findings establish a novel pathway for fabricating high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs and open up a new avenue for exploring the chiral optoelectronic application.

Introducing the achiral energy acceptor &lt;b&gt;BCz-BN&lt;/b&gt; at optimal concentrations enabled efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;99%), producing ternary co-assembled N*-LCs films. These films retained the nematic order while inheriting the narrowband emission and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of &lt;b&gt;BCz-BN&lt;/b&gt;. This approach achieves unprecedented CP-OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| value of 0.61, a maximum EQE of 9.0%, and narrowband electroluminescence with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. These findings establish a novel pathway for fabricating high-performance CP-OLEDs and open up a new avenue for exploring the chiral optoelectronic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Diamine Synthesis for Covalent Organic Frameworks: Boosted Photocatalytic Performance by Restricting &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine Bond Twist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing nonlinear connections through C1h ligand, the twist of linkers caused by &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond is restricted. This approach maintains the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, facilitating electron separation and transport, thereby boosting photocatalytic performance, such as the production of H2O2.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are typically formed by the covalent bonding of geometrically symmetrical linkers. In this work, an asymmetric (C1h symmetry) amine linker (2,6&#8208;diaminobenzothiazole) was employed to non&#8208;linearly connect and synthesize the COFs (TpBa) featuring &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond, which lead to the discovery of interesting &#8220;angle&#8208;induced restricted twist (AIRT)&#8221; effect. Compared with the COFs TpPa and TpDa with geometrically symmetrical linkers, the presence of asymmetric amine moieties in TpBa introduced certain angles between building blocks, mitigating the twist of the molecular plane caused by spatial steric hindrance on both sides of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bonds thereby preserving the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Although TpDa exhibited a more favorable charges structure and distribution for separation and transport, TpBa demonstrated superior H2O2 yield, suggesting the potential dominance of the AIRT effect under specific conditions. This work not only expands the option for COFs linker selection but also provides insights into boosting the photocatalytic performance of COFs.

         <title>Bi&#9472;O Bridges Trigger Lattice Strain&#8208;Electronic Synergy at Inherent In Sites in ZnIn2S4 for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic Bi&#9472;O coordination in ZnIn2S4 triggers synergistic lattice strain and electronic rearrangement to activate Inherent In sites, significantly optimizing charge carrier dynamics and stabilizing key intermediates, thus enabling dual&#8208;site O2 adsorption&#8211;conversion and functioning as a proton reservoir. This design achieves an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate (6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency (2.32%) with 97.3% selectivity for the 2e&#8722; pathway.








Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents represents a promising yet challenging route for sustainable chemical production, hindered by low solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency (natural photosynthesis is only &#8764;0.1%). Notably, the abundant inherent active sites within base semiconductors remain substantially underutilized. Here, we incorporate Bi into ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) lattices through atomic&#8208;level Bi&#9472;O coordination, activating inherent In sites via synergistic lattice strain and electron rearrangement. Multiscale characterization confirms the formation of BiO2S2&#8211;ZIS with quantified 1.51% lattice elongation. Integrated theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses reveal that Bi&#9472;O coordination increases electron density at adjacent In sites, which lowers the p&#8208;band center and enhances carrier separation. Meanwhile, lattice strain strengthens Bi&#9472;O orbital hybridization and weakens In&#9472;O covalency. Thus, these effects cooperatively optimize carrier dynamics. Then, the O2 adsorption is Pauling&#8208;type at In site to Yeager&#8208;type adsorption at the In&#9472;Bi dual sites. Simultaneously, Bi&#9472;O bridges function as proton reservoirs to facilitate *OOH formation and *H2O2 synthesis through enhanced Coulombic interactions. The resulting strain&#8208;electron synergy achieves an unprecedented H2O2 production rate of 6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 2.32% SCC efficiency, surpassing all reported inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts. This work demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance and establishes a highly effective strategy for inherent site activation.

         <title>Programmable Ultralong Phosphorescent Ionogels for Intelligent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly tough room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) ionogels (77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) has been fabricated with long lifetimes (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, &#964;&#160;&#8776;&#160;5.23&#160;s) and broad color gamut (from deep blue to NIR&#8208;I). The ionogels have been integrated into real&#8208;time strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring, smart conductive materials, as well as intelligent grippers, thus demonstrating their potential application in smart materials. 








Abstract
Pure organic flexible RTP materials show broad application prospects in fields such as electronic sensing and high&#8208;resolution displays. IGs offer advantages over conventional soft matter due to their high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and low volatility. However, flexible IGs often fail to provide sufficient rigidity to protect triplet excitons from environmental quenching, presenting a challenge in the development of RTP&#8208;IGs. Additionally, these materials may encounter unforeseen circumstances during operation that compromise their functional integrity, affecting real&#8208;time monitoring effectiveness. Developing novel IG systems with excellent RTP properties and real&#8208;time monitoring capabilities is thus urgent and meaningful. This work fabricated a novel, mechanically outstanding IG material (toughness&#160;&#8776;&#160;77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) serving as an excellent matrix for flexible RTP materials. A trace doping strategy endowed these materials with ultralong full&#8208;color RTP (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, lifetime up to 5.23&#160;s), demonstrating potential for real&#8208;time operational state monitoring. These systems were applied in strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring materials, smart conductive systems, and an intelligent thermally driven claw.

         <title>Spin Interactions in Supramolecular Assemblies of Porphyrin Oligomer Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;strand porphyrin ladder complexes offer an excellent way to hold two spin centers in a well&#8208;defined structure. Nutation experiments on the dianion of such complexes confirm the presence of doublet and triplet species. Spin dynamics simulations show that the emergence of these higher multiplicities can be fully accounted for by considering the dipolar interaction between electron spins.








Abstract
Diradicals have potential applications in spintronics, molecular electronics, and dynamic nuclear polarization due to their unique electronic structure. Supramolecular diradicals are particularly attractive, as changes in conformation can be used to switch the spin state. In this work, we explore a class of supramolecular diradicals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of charged zinc porphyrin oligomers with bidentate ligands such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and 4,4'&#8208;bipyridyl. Field&#8208;dependent nutation experiments on the anions of porphyrin ladder complexes show nutation frequencies corresponding to doublet and triplet species, which can both be attributed to the same spin system using simulations based on the time evolution of the density matrix. Density functional theory was used to calculate dipolar coupling tensors and provided insights into the electronic structure of these double&#8208;stranded&#160;assemblies.

         <title>Mesoporous PtPd Alloy &#8208; High Entropy Oxide Heterostructures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthetic approach has been developed to obtain mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO heterostructures via in situ assembly from MOF&#8208;derived HEAs. Excellent catalytic efficiency and durability for MOR are exhibited by the resulting material, with performance significantly outperforming that of commercial benchmarks. 








Abstract
The widespread adoption of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has been significantly hindered by the low activity of commercial noble metal catalysts toward the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and their susceptibility to CO poisoning. To address these challenges, a mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO (HEO&#160;=&#160;high entropy oxide) heterostructure is assembled in situ from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived high entropy alloy (HEA) in this work. Mass activity exceeding that of commercial Pt/C by more than an order of magnitude is demonstrated by this catalyst. A peak power density of 155&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term operational stability are achieved in a DMFC assembled with mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO, surpassing the performance of cells based on Pt/C and PtPd/C. In situ spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the valence electronic structure of the PtPd alloy is modulated by the HEO component, resulting in improved selectivity for non&#8208;CO pathways and increased formation of reactive hydroxyl species. Superior MOR catalytic activity and durability for PtPd&#8208;HEO are attributed to this synergistic electronic tuning and the porous structure. The development of HEO&#8208;based mesoporous heterostructures is proposed as a promising strategy for the design of next&#8208;generation catalysts in energy conversion and sustainable technologies.

         <title>Ph2SCCO: A New Versatile CCO&#8208;Fragment Transfer Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the unprecedented heterocumulene Ph2SCCO is presented. Starting from simple precursors, Ph2SCCO provides direct access to the valuable class of (bicyclic) &#945;&#8208;cyclopropylcarbonyl compounds. It has emerged from our reactivity studies as an excellent reagent for the CCO fragment transfer in organic synthesis.








Abstract
ketenylidene (C2O) is an electronically intriguing small molecule with significant potential as a C2 synthon in organic synthesis. However, its high reactivity has thus far precluded practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new reagent, the heterocumulene Ph2S&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O (1), a well&#8208;defined C2O equivalent that accurately replicates the chemical reactivity profile of C2O in a controlled manner. 1 uniquely integrates ketene&#8208;like and classical carbene reactivity. In the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids, 1 undergoes initial 1,2&#8208;addition to form a sulfur ylide intermediate, which can be exploited for subsequent reactions including cyclopropanation, epoxidation, or X&#8211;H addition. The CCO fragment transfer strategy, starting from simple precursors, enables efficient access to &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208; as well as &#945;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;carbonyl derivatives and structurally complex bicyclic cyclopropanes.

         <title>Advanced Self&#8208;Phase&#8208;Separating Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

The self&#8208;phase&#8208;separating electrolyte, with 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) co&#8208;solvents, exploiting solvation disparity to ensure efficient conversion kinetics of sulfur cathode and counter lithium polysulfides shuttle effects.

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries face a critical challenge in synergistically optimizing high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading redox kinetics and suppressing soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a self&#8208;phase&#8208;separating electrolyte design strategy based on heterogeneous LiPSs dissolution characteristics, using co&#8208;solvents of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) to induce spontaneous phase separation during LiPSs dissolution through solvation disparity. The constructed electrolyte system facilitates formation of a strong&#8208;solvation region at the cathode to maintain rapid sulfur redox kinetics while establishing a weak&#8208;solvation region at the anode to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby achieving dual objectives of &#8220;kinetics promotion and shuttle suppression&#8221; via a spatially partitioned dual&#8208;zone synergistic mechanism. This strategy enables steady cycling above 170 cycles of single&#8208;layer Li&#8208;S pouch cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathodes (4.3 mgs cm&#8722;2). Moreover, under practical lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions (6.2 mgs cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading, 50&#160;&#181;m Li, 3&#160;&#181;L mgs&#8722;1 electrolyte), a 1.8 Ah multi&#8208;layer pouch cell delivers 323&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density with stable cycling above 50 cycles. This work provides an effective solution for resolving the critical trade&#8208;off between rapid sulfur conversion kinetics and stable anode interfacial behavior in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetraarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of structurally novel axially chiral tetraarylethenes has been synthesized for the first time through an electrophilic aromatic substitution of phenols with 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones, facilitated by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The resulting highly enantioenriched products enable further stereospecific elaborations to yield chiral materials with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.








Abstract
Chiral TAEs hold great promise for the development of optically active materials. However, current strategies for constructing such structures are largely limited to introduce spatially distal central chirality or intrinsically helical chirality. In this work, we have incorporated axial chirality to create a novel class of skeletally innovative atropisomeric TAEs for the first time. A CPA&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral TAEs has been established, enabled by an enantioselective aromatic substitution of phenols using 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones as electrophiles. This method achieves excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol for all attempted substrates under the optimized conditions. The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE&#8208;based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.

         <title>[3]CycloBODIPY: A Highly Strained Cyclic BODIPY Trimer with Effective Macrocyclic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic [3]cycloBODIPY, composed solely of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) units, was synthesized via gold&#8208;mediated cyclization. Despite its high strain energy (86.4&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1), flexible boron centers help disperse the strain. The macrocycle shows near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 1050&#160;nm due to BODIPY deformation and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. 








Abstract
Cyclic oligomers containing porphyrinic chromophores have attracted significant attention in broad areas of science as artificial models for photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting antennae due to their structural and functional resemblance to natural chlorophyll arrays. Here, the synthesis of a macrocyclic [3]cycloBODIPY derivative, which consists of only boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) units, via an Au&#8208;mediated macrocyclization protocol is reported. While this [3]cycloBODIPY derivative exhibits a high total strain energy of 86.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, part of the intrinsic strain is effectively dispersed due to the flexible boron centers. Furthermore, this [3]cycloBODIPY derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1050&#160;nm as the result of two electronic modulation factors, i.e., deformation of the BODIPY subunits and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the entire macrocycle.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineering of Au&#8211;Ag Nanoclusters Enables Divergent Triplet Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle structural changes in Au&#8211;Ag nanoclusters with an identical Au6 core give rise to distinct triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence: Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, while Au6Ag4 shows dual emission involving phosphorescence and TADF, driven by differences in metal&#8211;ligand interactions and excited&#8208;state electronic coupling.








Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state&#8208;based luminescence holds great promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic materials, yet its mechanistic modulation through structural control remains a fundamental challenge for nanomaterials. Here, we present a comparative study of two atomically precise nanoclusters, Au6Ag2 and Au6Ag4, which feature an identical Au6 core but differ subtly in Ag atom count and ligand coordination. Despite their structural similarity and triplet dominated emission origin, the results herein reveal that Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, whereas Au6Ag4 demonstrates dual emission involving both phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The contrasting behaviors arise from fine&#8208;tuning the silver contents and organic ligands, which alters photoluminescence nature without modifying the metal core. This work highlights a structure&#8208;driven approach to regulating triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence in metal nanoclusters and offers a blueprint for designing next&#8208;generation triplet&#8208;emissive materials.

         <title>Lean&#8208;Water Gel Electrolyte Enables Zinc Ion Battery at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>
The study developed a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer system formed by in situ polymerization of the DOL strategy, which exhibits excellent performance at low temperatures of &#8722;70 &#176;C due to its fast kinetic process. It can also change the storage model of H+ in the cathode, prevent electrode passivation, and achieve stable cycling under high loads. 








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are attracting growing interest in electrochemical energy storage due to safety, reliability, and affordability. However, water brings drawbacks including parasitic reactions, narrow electrochemical window, and cathode degradation. The freezing nature of water also challenges the zinc ion transport and storage at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, especially below &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Here, we design a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer electrolyte to confine water using a weak&#8208;solvation monomer&#8208;directed polymerization technique initiated by protons. This electrolyte strategy significantly suppresses the water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and widens the electrochemical window to 2.59&#160;V. Besides, a high ionic conductivity of 0.36&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 is achieved at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C benefiting from unique fast ion transport channel and favorable desolvation process at the interface. Symmetric Zn cells exhibit excellent cycle stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h (437 days) at room temperature (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@1 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 700&#160;h at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (5.25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@5.25 mAh cm&#8722;2). Zn||Zn0.58V2O5 full cells show impressive performance under high mass loading and low temperatures originating from the suppression of H+ insertion. The electrolyte strategy in this work will inspire more efforts for water confinement in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridge&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes by Catalytic Metal Carbene Insertion into Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion reaction into bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been developed. This method enables access to previously unattainable 2&#8208;functionalized BCPs featuring quaternary and tertiary bridges, with high yields and broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a stepwise addition pathway with excellent regioselectivity, which avoids diene fragmentation. 








Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are emerging saturated hydrocarbon bioisosteres for polysubstituted benzenes; however, their synthesis from bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) via direct metal carbene insertion remains unrealized. Herein, we report the first catalytic metal carbene insertion into BCBs using triftosylhydrazones as safe and stable carbene precursors, which circumvents the use of [1.1.1]propellane in the synthesis of the BCPs scaffold. This operationally straightforward method accommodates a wide range of substituted BCB esters and triftosylhydrazones, enabling the synthesis of valuable 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCPs, including those bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary all&#8208;carbon center, in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Selective post&#8208;synthetic transformations of the product BCP esters into other useful small&#8208;ring building blocks, as well as the preparation of the BCP analogue of a drug molecule fragment, demonstrate the versatility and utility of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations, including density functional theory calculations, support a direct, stepwise metal carbene addition into the C&#9472;C bond of the BCB.

         <title>Channel&#8208;Pocket Ultra&#8208;Micropore Configuration in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Simultaneous High Xe Capture and Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

We have designed a threefold interpenetrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with a channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore configuration. This HOF achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation.








Abstract
Development of energy&#8208;efficient physisorbents for xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation is highly essential to produce high&#8208;purity noble gases and control the pollution of radioactive isotopes. Porous organic materials are very promising for gas separation due to their advantages of low regeneration energy, high moisture resistance, good solution processability and easy regeneration.

     alt="Channel-Pocket Ultra-Micropore Configuration in a Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework for Simultaneous High Xe Capture and Xe/Kr Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have designed a threefold interpenetrated hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) with a channel-pocket ultra-micropore configuration. This HOF achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of energy-efficient physisorbents for xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation is highly essential to produce high-purity noble gases and control the pollution of radioactive isotopes. Porous organic materials are very promising for gas separation due to their advantages of low regeneration energy, high moisture resistance, good solution processability and easy regeneration. However, their nonpolar pore surfaces lack strong sorbate&#8211;sorbent interactions, leading to the intrinsic trade-off between Xe capacity and selectivity that severely delimit their separation efficiency. Herein, we report a strategy of designing channel-pocket ultra-micropore configuration in a threefold interpenetrated HOF (ZJU-HOF-6a) for achieving simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation. This channel-pocket ultra-micropore structure can provide the size-matched pore channels and cavities (4.7 and 4.4&#160;&#197;) to offer strong pore confinement for highly selective binding of Xe, and also maximize the usage of pore spaces for high surface area (1113&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to target large Xe adsorption. ZJU-HOF-6a thus achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe uptake (3.3&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and record Xe/Kr selectivity (23.5) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, surpassing all the reported porous organic materials. The adsorption binding of Xe and Kr was visualized by gas-loaded ZJU-HOF-6a crystal structures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate its exceptional separation capacities for actual Xe/Kr mixtures under ambient conditions, affording the record-high dynamic selectivity (13.7) among porous organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perspective on Interdisciplinary Approaches on Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotaxis is the movement of individual organisms towards or away from a chemical stimulus. This phenomenon is investigated in various disciplines, ranging from biology to physics and even engineering. This perspective aims to summarise recent developments in the field and encourage the unification of terminology to promote interdisciplinary knowledge transfer and collaboration.








Abstract
Most living things on Earth &#8211; from bacteria to humans &#8211; must migrate in some way to find favourable conditions. Therefore, they nearly all use chemotaxis, in which their movement is steered by a gradient of chemicals. Chemotaxis is fundamental to many processes that control our well&#8208;being, including inflammation, neuronal patterning, wound healing, tumour spread in cancer, even embryogenesis. Understanding it is a key goal for biologists. Despite the fact that many basic principles appear to have been conserved throughout evolution, most research has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that control signal processing and locomotion. Cell signaling &#8211; cells responding to time&#8208;varying external signals &#8211; underlies almost all biological processes at the cellular scale. Chemotaxis of single cells provides particularly amenable model systems for quantitative cell signaling studies, even in the presence of noise and fluctuations, because the output, the cell's motility response, is directly observable. However, the different scientific disciplines involved in chemotaxis research rarely overlap, so biologists, physicists and mathematicians interact far too infrequently, methodologies and models differ and commonalities are often overlooked, such as the possible influence of physical or environmental conditions, which has been largely neglected.

         <title>Cooperative Auvertex&#8211;Aushoulder Pair Sites of Biicosahedral Au25 Cluster for Highly Oxidative Carbonylation of Diamine to Cyclic Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+ cluster in the library of metal clusters is unique for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine, in which the apical Cl exchange and phosphine dissociation expose adjacent Auvertex and Aushoulder sites that provide access to diamine and CO and activate oxygen molecules into singlet oxygen, thereby achieving a complete selectivity for cyclic urea.








Abstract
The realization of target reactants completely transformed on the designed active sites toward desired products remains a challenge. Here, we report that the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+ cluster in the library of metal clusters is unique for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine to cyclic urea. Our studies reveal that the ligand on&#8211;off dynamics in the presence of solvent coupled with diamine can invoke the active function of the vertex and shoulder Au of the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+, i.e., that is respectively capped by Cl and PPh3. Notably, the transient exposed Auvertex&#8211;Aushoulder neighboring sites exhibit a selective recognition to reaction molecules, leading to the interdependent and stepwise reactivity for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine with CO and O2. The diamine is preferentially adsorbed on the Aushoulder site, with the CO inserting sequentially into the diamine to produce the key intermediate containing the secondary amide group, and meanwhile the Auvertex site engages in converting O2 to singlet oxygen and finally enables the H&#8208;atom abstraction from the amine group of the above intermediate, thereby achieving an exclusive selectivity for cyclic urea. This work provides an alternative route for the efficient carbonylation upgrading of diamine, typically distinguished from homogeneous organometallic complexes and heterogeneous supported metal catalysts.

         <title>Construction of Artificial Cells with Urea Cycle Pathway for Ammonia Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial cells containing urea cycle function are constructed to efficiently convert NH4HCO3 to urea, which are used for ammonia detoxification to rescue cells.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial cells helps to understand cell working mechanisms. It is a great challenge to build artificial cells capable of detoxification. Herein, the urea cycle pathway is reconstituted inside artificial cells for ammonium detoxification. The urea cycle pathway involves carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase, which converts NH4HCO3 to urea using a cyclic metabolic pathway. The urea is produced in a stepwise manner with the addition of NH4HCO3 when the cyclic metabolic reaction reaches equilibrium. The urea cycle pathway and NH4HCO3 are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to construct artificial cells capable of ammonium detoxification. The urea is produced inside artificial cells with the conversion rate of 61.9%. The concentration of extracellular NH4HCO3 is decreased from 20.0 to 2.3&#160;mM with the addition of 1.5&#215;106&#160;mL&#8722;1 artificial cells, due to the inflow of NH4HCO3 through melittin pores in the membrane and subsequently metabolized by urea cycle pathway. It indicates the ammonium detoxification ability of artificial cells containing urea cycle pathway, which is further proved by rescuing Schwann cells in high concentration of NH4HCO3. This work paves a path to build functional artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks for their biomedical applications.

         <title>Direct Access to Acylboranes via Formal Condensation of Carboxylic Acids with Ligated Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed, radical&#8208;based C(acyl)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling strategy has been developed for the efficient synthesis of bench&#8208;stable, phosphonite&#8208;ligated acylborane compounds from readily available carboxylic acids. This methodology not only provides access to acylboranes with diverse reactivity profiles but also establishes a versatile platform for the direct construction of stabilized organoborane species, which has currently been extended to C(aryl) systems.








Abstract
The unique synthetic potential of acylboron species has long attracted attention from the synthetic chemistry community, but their broader application has been limited by challenges associated with their preparation. In this work, we report a mechanistically distinct radical&#8208;based C(acyl)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling strategy that enables a &#8220;formal condensation&#8221; between readily available carboxylic acids and easily accessible ligated boranes. The success of this transformation relies on the distinctive use of a phosphonite ligand, which achieves an optimal balance between the stability and reactivity of the borane moiety. This method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with high practical utility, and its strategic value has been further highlighted through diverse downstream derivatizations of the resulting acylborane compounds.

The success of this transformation relies on the distinctive use of a phosphonite ligand, which achieves an optimal balance between the stability and reactivity of the borane moiety. This method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with high practical utility, and its strategic value has been further highlighted through diverse downstream derivatizations of the resulting acylborane compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Nitrate Reduction through Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; Microenvironment Modulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia suffers from slow proton transfer. We constructed a carbonate&#8208;modulated microenvironment around Ru single&#8208;atom sites that reorganizes the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network. This Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; configuration facilitates proton transport and suppresses competing reactions, enhancing nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The work provides a practical strategy for wastewater purification and ammonia production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;rich wastewater to ammonia (NH3) offers an attractive and sustainable strategy for green and cost&#8208;effective NH3 synthesis. However, slow proton transfer kinetics remains a persistent challenge, limiting both reaction activity and selectivity. We develop a strategy of leveraging anion (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;modulated microenvironments around single&#8208;atom (ruthenium, Ru) sites to accelerate proton transfer leveraging. By modulating the electrolyte composition, we constructed a Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; microenvironment that facilitated a highly interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) network and promoted proton transfer kinetics. This microenvironment significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance, enabling an NH3 production of 76.36&#160;mg&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mgcat.&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90% for NO3RR in an integrated electrocatalytic system. This approach offers a cost&#8208;effective and practical strategy for converting NO3&#8722;&#8208;rich wastewater into valuable NH3, while providing mechanistic insights into proton transfer and interfacial regulation.

         <title>Enhanced CO Oxidation on PtOx Raft Species Synthesized via Citric Acid&#8208;Assisted Electrostatic Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Pt/CeO2 catalysts in CO oxidation was significantly improved through the formation of single&#8208;layer raft nanostructures, achieved via a citric acid&#8208;assisted strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) strategy. This approach exploited the competitive adsorption between noble metal precursors and organic ligands, thereby facilitating the controlled nanostructuring of Pt species.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts have attracted considerable attention for CO oxidation, with their activity critically dependent on the nanostructures of Pt species. Herein, raft&#8208;structured PtOx species on CeO2 support (Pt/CeO2&#8208;CA) were successfully prepared via a citric acid&#8208;assisted strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) method, which leveraged competitive adsorption between noble metal precursors and organic compounds. The Pt/CeO2&#8208;CA catalyst exhibits a T50 (temperature for 50% CO conversion) over 120&#160;&#176;C lower than those of Pt single atoms and PtOx clusters&#8208;based catalysts, and the lowest apparent activation energy among the catalysts investigated, as well as reported analogues, demonstrating its excellent activity in CO oxidation. Combined catalyst characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate enhanced CO adsorption on PtOx rafts with respect to Pt/CeO2 reference catalysts composed of Pt single atoms or PtOx clusters, and favored CO interaction with O* atoms from PtOx rafts and the CeO2 surface. We propose that this mitigates CO poisoning effects by circumventing competitive adsorption with O2, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction. Our findings highlight promising design strategies for tuning the morphology of supported noble metal (oxide) nanostructures to further enhance their catalytic performances.

         <title>The Methylbismuth Dication: Pentagonal Pyramidal Coordination and Ligand&#8208;Induced Lewis Superacidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplistic methylbismuth dication has been captured only by the aid of monodentate tetrahydrofuran (thf) ligands, [BiMe(thf)5]2+. The hexacoordinate species shows a very unusual pentagonal pyramidal coordination geometry. Unparalleled Lewis acidic and Lewis superacidic properties have been revealed by exploiting the coordination chemical properties of the &#8220;BiMe2+&#8221; complex fragment and the substitutional lability of the thf ligands.








Abstract
A profound understanding of the naturally preferred coordination geometry of molecular complexes is the basis for scientists to rationalize, predict, and design their physico&#8208;chemical properties and reactivity. Gaining access to compounds with an unusual coordination chemistry and developing a fundamental knowledge about their properties represent key challenges in the field. Tackling these questions promises an entry to unexplored chemical space and reactivity patterns that are inaccessible for compounds found in more traditional coordination geometries. Here, we present the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of the simplest organobismuth dication, the methylbismuth dication [BiMe(thf)5][SbF6]2 (1), stabilized only by five substitutionally labile THF ligands. The hexa&#8208;coordinate compound shows a rare pentagonal pyramidal coordination geometry around the central atom, which is extremely unusual given the fact that this is an organometallic species with only simple monodentate monoanionic and/or neutral ligands without considerable steric bulk. The detailed investigation of this compound with experimental and theoretical approaches reveals the cause of the unusual coordination chemistry and uncovers multiple Lewis acidic binding sites and ligand&#8208;induced Lewis superacidity.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electro&#8208;Fenton Oxidation Enabled by CoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Oxygen Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#160;+&#160;1e&#8211; ORR electrocatalyst (CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN) with Co&#8208;Cu diatomic pairs and cyano groups exhibits excellent performance in the electrochemical generation and activation of hydrogen peroxide, owing to its high oxygen utilization efficiency.








Abstract
The Electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) technique offers a promising strategy for recalcitrant organic pollutant removal by coupling the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) for H2O2 synthesis with its subsequent activation to &#8226;OH via one&#8208;electron (1e&#8211;) reduction. To address the distinct favorable active sites and mismatched selectivity between 2e&#8211; ORR and 1e&#8211; H2O2 activation, we develop an integrated 2&#160;+&#160;1e&#8211; tandem ORR catalyst with CoCu diatomic pairs (CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN) and cyano modification to improve oxygen capture and utilization efficiency (OUE, 39.8%). The CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;based EF system achieves 100.0% of bisphenol A (BPA) in 40.0&#160;min with a high&#8208;rate constant of k&#160;=&#160;0.57 min&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations indicate that the&#160;&#8722;CN moieties in CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN greatly facilitate O2 adsorption, which further migrates to the Co site to proceed 2e&#8211; ORR with a reduced energy barrier. The generated H2O2 spontaneously migrates to the surrounding Cu site for in situ activation to generate &#8226;OH. Long&#8208;term operation of a CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;equipped flow&#8208;cell device that maintains 100.0% bisphenol A removal even without O2/air pumping. Technoeconomic analysis indicates that the CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;based EF process effectively reduced electrical energy consumption by 74.4%, demonstrating its promise for energy&#8208;efficient wastewater treatment.

         <title>Proton Transfer&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Network for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy integrating co&#8208;adsorbed self&#8208;assembled monolayer and phenylguanidine carbonate additive simultaneously resolves poor SAM substrate quality and inherent bulk defects in perovskite films, enabling inverted perovskite solar cells with 26.65% efficiency and enhanced operational stability.








Abstract
The development and application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) has revolutionized the advancement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the performance of inverted PSCs remains limited by intrinsic defects in perovskite thin films, primarily due to inadequate control over crystallization on the poor&#8208;quality SAM substrates. Here, we reported a proton transfer&#8208;hydrogen bond network using a multifunctional additive phenylguanidine carbonate over a co&#8208;adsorbed SAM (Co&#8208;SAM) system. This strategy promoted the formation of guanidinium&#8208;formamidinium hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes, which stabilize intermediate phases, suppress the generation of impurity phases during nucleation and accelerate the transition from &#948;&#8208;phase to &#945;&#8208;phase. The significantly delayed crystallization process successfully induced large perovskite grains with suppressed intrinsic defects. Moreover, a high coverage, uniformity, and dense molecular packing was achieved for the Co&#8208;SAM, ensuring an excellent growth substrate for subsequent perovskite deposition. PSCs ultimately achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, with enhanced operational stability&#8208;retaining 92.5% of initial PCE after&#160;&gt;1200 h of maximum power point tracking.

Here, we reported a proton transfer-hydrogen bond network using a multifunctional additive phenylguanidine carbonate over a co-adsorbed SAM (Co-SAM) system. This strategy promoted the formation of guanidinium-formamidinium hydrogen-bonded complexes, which stabilize intermediate phases, suppress the generation of impurity phases during nucleation and accelerate the transition from &#948;-phase to &#945;-phase. The significantly delayed crystallization process successfully induced large perovskite grains with suppressed intrinsic defects. Moreover, a high coverage, uniformity, and dense molecular packing was achieved for the Co-SAM, ensuring an excellent growth substrate for subsequent perovskite deposition.

         <title>Halogen Co&#8208;Mixing&#8212;An Effective Strategy for Optimizing Luminescent Performance of Copper&#8208;Based Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a novel strategy&#8211;halogen co&#8208;mixing (HCM) to prepare a copper hybrid scintillator. By shortening the Cu&#8211;Cu distance and increasing lattice asymmetry, it achieved an ultrahigh PLQY of 99.5% and light yield of 146k phonons MeV&#8722;1, which proved the effective optimization of HCM to PL and RL properties of luminescent materials. Based on it, a scintillation screen with a resolution of 30 lp mm&#8722;1 was prepared and applied in various scenes.








Abstract
Recently, copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators have emerged as a popular research area. However, its development remains in its infancy, and there is an urgent need to explore copper&#8208;based scintillator materials with superior performance. Herein, we proposed an effective strategy of halogen co&#8208;mixing (HCM) to develop a copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillator with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 99.5% and an ultrahigh light yield (LY) of 145896 phonons MeV&#8722;1. Its light yield exceeds that of all commercial scintillators and is currently the highest record in copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators. Based on this, a flexible imaging screen with a fantastic resolution of 30 lp mm&#8722;1 was prepared, which is able to meet various application requirements. More importantly, two monohalogen compounds were synthesized for the analysis of optimization mechanisms. After detailed comparative study, it was found that the HCM strategy effectively optimize the luminescence of copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators by increasing the lattice asymmetry and shortening the Cu&#8211;Cu distance in the inorganic module. The proposal of HCM strategy has significant guiding significance for the development of high&#8208;performance scintillator materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights of Bipolar Redox Cathodes for Organic Rechargeable Batteries: LUMO Anti&#8210;Bonding Contributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design framework for bipolar organic cathodes is established by integrating p&#8210;type pendants (&#8210;NH2, &#8210;OH, &#8210;SH) with carbonyl backbones and elucidating their structure&#8210;property relationships. Thermodynamic and electronic analyses clarify mechanistic origins of bipolar redox activity, while PF6&#8208;induced decomposition is confirmed to form only HF&#8208;coordinated adducts beyond standard operating voltage window, posing no performance penalty.








Abstract
The search for sustainable organic cathode materials has been constrained by intrinsically low redox potentials and limited understanding of p&#8210;type redox chemistry. In this study, we establish a rational design framework for bipolar cathodes by combining p&#8210;type functionalities (&#8210;NH2, &#8210;OH, &#8210;SH) with carbonyl backbones and elucidating their structure&#8210;property relationships using the first&#8208;principles calculations. We find that redox potentials and resultant discharging behaviors are governed by the interplay between backbone electron deficiency, p&#8210;type pendant group identity, and solvation stability, in conjunction with charging energy and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) anti&#8208;bonding contributions as principal electronic descriptors. While PF6 anion&#8208;induced decomposition occurs through backbone fluorination and/or locally HF&#8208;coordinated bipolar compound generation depending on p&#8210;type functionality, its onset beyond the electrochemical voltage window allows full utilization of both n&#8210;type and p&#8210;type mechanisms. This design strategy enables theoretical charge capacities and energy densities that surpass those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic and organic cathodes. These insights highlight the underexplored role of p&#8210;type functionalities and provide molecular&#8210;level guidelines for engineering next&#8210;generation, high&#8210;performance organic cathodes.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Catalytic Performance Tuning of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Using a Weaving Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a universal weaving strategy, researchers synthesized HE&#8208;MOFs by precisely controlling the dosage of metal&#8211;ligand complexes (MLs) and H2L. After carbonization, these HE&#8208;MOFs were converted into HEAs/CeO2/C, featuring tunable metal contents and adjustable catalytic activities. This method provides a novel approach for designing multicomponent catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered considerable interest for their exceptional properties, notably in catalysis, owing to their multiple active sites and synergistic metal interactions. High&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HE&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising precursors for the synthesis of diverse HEAs. However, conventional approaches to synthesizing HE&#8208;MOFs rely primarily on increasing metal ion diversity within the MOF nodes, often leading to complex and poorly controlled reaction kinetics. In this work, we present a novel weaving strategy that incorporates the pre&#8208;synthesis of metal&#8211;ligand complexes (MLs) as modular building blocks to overcome the intricate coordination dynamics associated with multiple metal ions and ligands. By designing a series of ML &#8220;threads&#8221; and precisely controlling their stoichiometry and combination, we successfully fabricate HE&#8208;MOFs incorporating cerium oxide clusters as structural nodes. Subsequent carbonization and reduction convert these HE&#8208;MOFs into CeO2/C&#8208;supported alloys or HEAs with finely adjustable metal contents and tunable catalytic properties. A dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system revealed that the optimized HEAs(10L)/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 13.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This pioneering method permits atomic&#8208;level control over the metal composition of HEAs, ensuring a broad range of metal ions are homogeneously distributed and enabling the rational design of highly efficient catalytic systems.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area COF Membrane with Hourglass&#8208;Shaped Nanochannels for Enhanced Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic hourglass&#8208;shaped covalent organic framework (COF) membranes fabricated via scalable spray coating enable efficient H2/CO2 separation. The sandwich architecture&#8212;large&#8208;pore sulfonated COF outer layers and narrow&#8208;pore guanidinium COF middle layer&#8212;achieves high H2 permeance and selectivity. Large&#8208;area membranes (5000 cm2) show robust stability and outperform PSA in H2 recovery (94.3%).








Abstract
Efficient hydrogen purification from methanol steam reforming (MSR) faces challenges due to H2/CO2 kinetic diameter overlap and energy&#8208;intensive traditional methods. Here, we report a biomimetic hourglass&#8208;shaped covalent organic framework (COF) membrane via sequential spray coating of opposite charged COF nanosheets, mimicking aquaporin&#8208;like hierarchical channels. The sandwich structure (large&#8208;pore sulfonated COF outer layers, narrow&#8208;pore guanidinium COF middle layer) enables dual&#8208;functionality: outer TpBD&#8208;SO3H layers perform as the diffusion chamber (2.5&#160;nm pores) and protective layer, whereas the middle TpTGCl layer (0.8&#160;nm pores) traps CO2 via strong electrostatic interactions. The membrane achieves a H2 permeance of 2833 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 21, surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound. Spray coating enables scalable fabrication of 5000 cm2 defect&#8208;free membranes on porous substrate with high mechanical stability and chemical resistance (mass loss&#160;&lt;&#160;0.3% in 150&#160;&#176;C methanol). Separation process simulations show a two&#8208;stage system boosts H2 purity to 96.7% with 94.3% recovery, outperforming pressure swing adsorption (PSA) in efficiency and energy consumption. This modular design offers a sustainable, scalable solution for industrial hydrogen purification and gas separation.

The sandwich architecture&#8212;large-pore sulfonated COF outer layers and narrow-pore guanidinium COF middle layer&#8212;achieves high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance and selectivity. Large-area membranes (5000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) show robust stability and outperform PSA in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovery (94.3%).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient hydrogen purification from methanol steam reforming (MSR) faces challenges due to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; kinetic diameter overlap and energy-intensive traditional methods. Here, we report a biomimetic hourglass-shaped covalent organic framework (COF) membrane via sequential spray coating of opposite charged COF nanosheets, mimicking aquaporin-like hierarchical channels. The sandwich structure (large-pore sulfonated COF outer layers, narrow-pore guanidinium COF middle layer) enables dual-functionality: outer TpBD-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H layers perform as the diffusion chamber (2.5&#160;nm pores) and protective layer, whereas the middle TpTGCl layer (0.8&#160;nm pores) traps CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via strong electrostatic interactions. The membrane achieves a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2833 GPU and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 21, surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound. Spray coating enables scalable fabrication of 5000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defect-free membranes on porous substrate with high mechanical stability and chemical resistance (mass loss&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.3% in 150&#160;&#176;C methanol). Separation process simulations show a two-stage system boosts H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purity to 96.7% with 94.3% recovery, outperforming pressure swing adsorption (PSA) in efficiency and energy consumption. This modular design offers a sustainable, scalable solution for industrial hydrogen purification and gas separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Asymmetrical Charge Distribution on Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn Sites in Sn&#8208;Doped Bi2MoO6 for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>

Sn doping into Bi2MoO6 introduces enhanced Ov and constructs charge&#8208;asymmetrical Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn sites for boosting proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and charge separation. This multisite catalyst exhibits excellent CO2 photoreduction activity in pure water, with an enhanced CH4 evolution rate of 207.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and unprecedented AQE of 9.4% at 420 nm.








Abstract
Efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) at tailored active sites is beneficial for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, yet the relationship between catalytic sites and performance remains unclear. Herein, p&#8208;block Sn is introduced into the Bi2MoO6 lattice (Sn&#8208;BMO) via Bi site substitution to construct a novel oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn structure, where high&#8208;valence Sn induces Ov formation by lowering the Bi valence state, thereby creating a charge&#8208;asymmetrical region. This unique configuration promotes PCET: Sn acts as H2O oxidation site, enabling proton transfer to proximal Bi site connected to Ov that preferentially traps electrons to convert CO2. Furthermore, the electronic structure of Bi is modified to optimize Bi 6p&#8208;C 2p hybridization for formation of the key intermediate *CHO with low energy barrier. Consequently, Sn&#8208;BMO exhibits a remarkable CH4 evolution rate of 207.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 95.7% CH4 selectivity in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum efficiency of 9.4% at 420&#160;nm. This work provides a novel approach to design charge&#8208;asymmetrical active site in multisite catalysts, elucidating how p&#8208;block elements influence catalytic performance in CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Unlocking Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network&#8208;Mediated Directional Spillover Mechanism in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond network&#8208;mediated spillover mechanism was designed over Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/CoP, wherein efficiently adsorbed H* on Pt sequentially shuttles into H&#8208;bond networks, undergoes directional transport via H&#8208;bond relays, and ultimately shuttles to g&#8208;C3N4 and then to CoP for facile H2 desorption. The resulting catalysts achieved ultrahigh Pt utilization activity for hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover offers a promising route to circumvent scaling relations in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by spatially decoupling the hydrogen adsorption and desorption steps. However, its practical application has been limited by sluggish spillover kinetics across heterogeneous interfaces. In this work, we propose a hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) network&#8208;mediated spillover mechanism that bypasses conventional interfacial mediation. Within this mechanism, active hydrogen species (H*) generated on one component sequentially enter the H&#8208;bond network, undergo directional transport via Grotthuss&#8208;type H* hopping along the network, and ultimately uptake onto another component. To realize this concept, we designed a Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/CoP catalyst, in which Pt effectively enriches H* to establish a coverage gradient from Pt&#8594;g&#8208;C3N4&#8594;CoP; g&#8208;C3N4 optimizes the proximity of the H&#8208;bond network to facilitate H* shuttling and serves as H* relay sites; and CoP provides facile sites for H2 desorption. This configuration enables efficient H&#8208;bond network&#8208;mediated spillover along the Pt&#8594;g&#8208;C3N4&#8594;CoP pathway, achieving an ultrahigh Pt&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized HER activity of 175.0&#160;A mgPt&#8722;1 at&#160;&#8722;0.1&#160;V vs. RHE in acidic medium. The mechanism elucidated here opens new avenues for catalyst design in multi&#8208;step hydrogen&#8208;involving electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Thermal Property Engineering in Mn&#8208;Based Hybrid Halides via Structural Tailoring of Phosphonium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing strategies such as carbon chain extension, branching increase, and structural isomerization, a series of Mn&#8208;based OIMHs with tunable melting temperature (110&#8211;257&#160;&#176;C) and glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA, 0.71&#8211;0.92) are successfully constructed, where the (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4 glass shows significant potential for high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray imaging applications.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide (OIMH) glasses have emerged as promising scintillator materials, distinguished by their exceptional optical transparency, straightforward synthesis, and tunable thermodynamic properties. The manufacturability and functional characteristics of these glasses are synergistically governed by the melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), and decomposition temperature (Td), which can be effectively regulated through rational structural modulation. In this study, monophosphonium salts functionalized with secondary ammonium groups (&#9472;NH2+R) are prepared. By utilizing strategies such as carbon chain extension, branching increase, and structural isomerization, a series of Mn&#8208;based OIMHs with tunable Tm (110.0&#8211;256.6&#160;&#176;C) and Tg (78.7&#8211;101.7&#160;&#176;C) are successfully constructed. To probe into the structure&#8208;performance relationship, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and density functional theory calculations are conducted. Notably, the (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4&#183;2H2O crystal (4&#8208;BATBP2+ = 4&#8208;(n&#8208;butylamino)butyltriphenylphosphonium) exhibits the highest glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA, Tg/Tm&#160;=&#160;0.92). The corresponding (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4 glass scintillator demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 20&#8211;25 lp mm&#8722;1 under X&#8208;ray irradiation and retains excellent stability after prolonged heat treatment at 65&#160;&#176;C for 130 days, underscoring its significant potential for high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

&lt;/i&gt; (110.0&#8211;256.6&#160;&#176;C) and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (78.7&#8211;101.7&#160;&#176;C) are successfully constructed. To probe into the structure-performance relationship, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and density functional theory calculations are conducted. Notably, the (4-BATBP)MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O crystal (4-BATBP&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; = 4-(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butylamino)butyltriphenylphosphonium) exhibits the highest glass-forming ability (GFA, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.92). The corresponding (4-BATBP)MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; glass scintillator demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 20&#8211;25 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under X-ray irradiation and retains excellent stability after prolonged heat treatment at 65&#160;&#176;C for 130 days, underscoring its significant potential for high-temperature X-ray imaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Controllable Divergent Carboxylation and Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 was developed for the green synthesis of various unsaturated and saturated aryl substituted mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylic acids.








Abstract
Carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 for the synthesis of value&#8208;added and versatile carboxylic acids are of great importance. However, harsh reaction conditions, poor selectivity, practicability, and sustainability have always restricted its application. Electrochemical synthesis has been considered as a practical and environmentally friendly organic synthesis strategy via a tunable redox process. Hence, herein, an efficient electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 was achieved to overcome the limitation of traditional methods. Four kinds of arylpropiolic acid, cinnamic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, and their derivatives can be obtained with good selectivity by regulating substrates, solvents, and electrolytes. The method features broad substrate scope, divergent transformation with good selectivity, scalability, additional reducing agent&#8208;, hydrogen donor&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and ligand&#8208;free conditions, which offer novel insights into electrochemically driven CO2 fixation and alkyne functionalization.
