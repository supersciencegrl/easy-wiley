         <title>Decoding Protein Dynamics in Cells Using Chemical Cross&#8208;Linking and Hierarchical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein dynamics play a crucial role in their diverse functions. The intracellular environment significantly influences protein dynamics, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To comprehensively capture structural information from various proteins wihtin cells and characterize protein dynamics, chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry was employed. In this study, we introduce a hierarchical decoding strategy that enables the investigation of protein dynamics in vivo. Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross&#8208;links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full&#8208;length structure of multi&#8208;domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 Clusters as Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2% ~ 98.2%), good stability (99% activity retention after 35 h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58 mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8208; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces with Modified Intermediate Configurations Realizing Nearly 100% CO2 Electrocatalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via renewable electricity provides a sustainable way for producing valued chemicals, while it suffers from low activity and selectivity. Herein, we constructed a novel catalyst with unique Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces, undercoordinated surface sites, as well as mesoporous nanostructures. The designed Ag&#8208;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx catalyst achievesan outstanding CO2 conversion performance of a nearly 100% CO Faraday efficiency with high partial current density of 22.59 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;at &#8722;0.87 V.&#160;The electronic donation of Ag and up&#8208;shifted d&#8208;band center relative to Fermi level within MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces contributes the high selectivity of CO. The CO2 conversion is highly correlated with the dominated linear&#8208;bonded CO intermediate confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This work enlightens the rational design of unique metal&#8208;oxide interfaces with the regulation of MXene for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Cyclopropenes under Lanthanocene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorogenic DNAzyme for A Thermally Stable Protein Biomarker from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Human Bacterial Pathogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusobacterium nucleatum has been correlated to many poor human conditions including oral infections, adverse pregnancies and cancer, and thus molecular tools capable of detecting this human pathogen can be used to develop diagnostic tests for them. Using a new selection method targeting thermally stable proteins without a counter&#8208;selection step, we derived an fluorogenic RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RFD&#8208;FN1, that can be activated by a thermally stable protein target that is unique to F. nucleatum subspecies. High thermal stability of protein targets is a very desirable attribute for DNAzyme&#8208;based biosensing directly with biological samples because nucleases found inherently in these samples can be heat inactivated. We further demonstrate that RFD&#8208;FN1 can function as a fluorescent sensor in both human saliva and human stool samples. The discovery of RFD&#8208;FN1 paired with a highly thermal stable protein target presents opportunities for developing simpler diagnostic tests for this important pathogen.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young&#8217;s moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Attack at Pentaarsaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] &#8211; The Way to Larger Polyarsenide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By the reaction of [Cp*Fe( &#951;  5  &#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp* = C5Me5) with main group nucleophiles, unique functionalized products with  &#951;  4  &#8208;coordinated polyarsenic (Asn) units (n = 5, 6, 20) are obtained. With carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles such as MeLi or KBn (Bn = CH2Ph), the anionic organo&#8208;substituted polyarsenide complexes, [Li(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5Me)] (1a) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe{&#951;4&#8208;As5(CH2Ph)}] (1b), are accessible. The use of KAsPh2 leads to a selective and controlled extension of the As5 unit and the formation of the monoanionic compound [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6Ph2)] (2).

         <title>Group Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt; 50 &#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Rules for Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Incorporated Perovskites (OSiP) Gleaned from Thousands of Simulated Structures
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D halide perovskites can accommodate a vast array of organic semiconducting ligands to potentially augment their functionality. A library of over 104 have been characterized by molecular dynamics and used to train machine learning models.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of stable ligand incorporation within Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phase perovskites are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten&#8208;thousand RP&#8208;phase perovskites and training of machine learning classifiers capable of predicting structural stability based solely on generalizable ligand features. The simulation results show near&#8208;perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade&#8208;offs between several ligand features and stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D&#8208;compatible ligand design&#8208;space.

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be designed and built up using multiple building blocks. Multicomponent MOFs employ building blocks that are distinct from one another and therefore occupy specific lattice positions. By maintaining periodicity while circumventing randomness and disorder, these materials enable exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this review highlights how this view was mistaken and frameworks comprising multiple different components can be deliberately designed and synthesized. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.

         <title>Perovskite Films Regulation via Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups was designed and successfully incorporated into perovskite film. The multiple chemical bonding interactions between the elastomer and perovskite lead to high&#8208;quality perovskite film and efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability and reduced lead leakage.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low cost. However, their long&#8208;term stability, mechanical durability, and environmental risks are still unable to meet practical needs. To overcome these issues, we designed a multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups. The chemical bonding between polymer and perovskite could increase the growth activation energy of perovskite film and promote the preferential growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Owing to the low defect density and gradient energy&#8208;level alignment, the corresponding device exhibited a champion efficiency of 23.10&#8201;%. Furthermore, due to the formation of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network in the perovskite film, the target devices demonstrated excellent air stability and enhanced flexibility for the flexible PSCs. More importantly, the polymer network could coordinate with Pb2+ ions, immobilizing lead atoms to reduce their release into the environment. This strategy paves the way for the industrialization of high&#8208;performance flexible PSCs.

         <title>A Click Chemistry&#8208;Based Artificial Metallo&#8208;Nuclease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry was used to prepare TC&#8208;Thio, a new artificial metallo&#8208;nuclease. TC&#8208;Thio coordinates up to three CuII ions and is a potent DNA damaging agent that binds and cleaves from the minor groove. Activity was assessed in primary human cells using single molecule imaging of DNA.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are promising DNA damaging drug candidates. Here, we demonstrate how the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker produced by the Cu&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can be directed to build Cu&#8208;binding AMN scaffolds. We selected biologically inert reaction partners tris(azidomethyl)mesitylene and ethynyl&#8208;thiophene to develop TC&#8208;Thio, a bioactive C3&#8208;symmetric ligand in which three thiophene&#8208;triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and forms multinuclear CuII and CuI complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon Cu coordination, CuII&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent. Mechanistic studies reveal DNA recognition occurs exclusively at the minor groove with subsequent oxidative damage promoted through a superoxide&#8208; and peroxide&#8208;dependent pathway. Single molecule imaging of DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells shows that the complex has comparable activity to the clinical drug temozolomide, causing DNA damage that is recognised by a combination of base excision repair (BER) enzymes.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric ligand in which three thiophene-triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X-ray crystallography and forms multinuclear Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon Cu coordination, Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-TC-Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent. Mechanistic studies reveal DNA recognition occurs exclusively at the minor groove with subsequent oxidative damage promoted through a superoxide- and peroxide-dependent pathway. Single molecule imaging of DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells shows that the complex has comparable activity to the clinical drug temozolomide, causing DNA damage that is recognised by a combination of base excision repair (BER) enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions was proposed to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to effectively eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M was obtained through guest&#8208;host recognition. After targeting S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected macrophages via ligand&#8208;receptor recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M underwent intracellular caspase&#8208;1&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form ciprofloxacin nanoparticle, leading to enhanced antibacterial efficiency.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S.&#8197;aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus infection efficiently.

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl Sc(CO)7 and octacarbonyl TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) complexes have been prepared using a laser vaporization&#8208;supersonic expansion source and characterized by size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses show that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase.







Abstract
Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8722;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.

         <title>Electron Donor Coordinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For electron donor coordinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, the photoelectrochemical electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculations and experiments, which show a self&#8208;supplying electrons strategy. The matching HOMO levels of the light collector and electron&#8208;donor ligands facilitate electron transfer which efficiently suppresses electron&#8208;hole recombination, greatly enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance.







Abstract
To enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, additional electron donor/acceptor is generally required to inhibit the electron&#8208;hole recombination. However, the enhancement is limited due to the long&#8208;distance diffusion. Herein a self&#8208;supplying electron strategy is designed for PEC enhancement by coordinating an electron donor 1.4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The intrareticular photoelectron transfer mechanism in mixed&#8208;ligand MOF (m&#8208;MOF) is experimentally revealed and verified by density functional theory calculations. The presence of Dabco efficiently inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination due to the self&#8208;supplying electrons and longer electron lifetime in the framework, and thus leads to 23.2&#8208;fold enhancement of photocurrent. As proof of concept, a simple PEC method is constructed with the designed m&#8208;MOF to demonstrate its application in sensitive bioanalysis. This work provides a new avenue for improving the PEC performance of nanomaterials.

         <title>Recoverable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Next&#8208;Generation Portable Power Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible perovskite solar cells have attracted wide attention because of their unique advantages, such as light weight and high flexibility. This review article discusses the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability of flexible perovskite solar cells, and highlights the practical applications. The outlook and challenges of durable flexible perovskite devices in future commercialization are also considered.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent recoverability show a wide range of potential applications in portable power sources. The recoverability of FPSCs requires outstanding bendability of each functional layer, including the flexible substrates, electrodes, perovskite light absorbers, and charge transport materials. This review highlights the recent progress and practical applications of high&#8208;recoverability FPSCs, and illustrates the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability through the choice of flexible substrates and the preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, as well as the optimization of charge&#8208;selective contacts. In addition, we explore the intrinsic properties of each functional layer from the physical perspective and analyze how to select suitable functional layers. Additionally, some effective strategies are summarized, including material modification engineering of selective contacts, additives and interface engineering of interlayers, which can release mechanical stress and increase the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and recoverability of the FPSCs. The challenges of making high&#8208;performance FPSCs with long&#8208;term stability and high recoverability are discussed. Finally, future applications and perspectives for FPSCs are discussed, aiming to promote more extensive commercialization processes for lightweight and durable FPSCs.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Glucose Oxidation by the Pt Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity was elucidated for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. A new analytical approach was used to quantify all (intermediate) products. Pt0 was found to promote the dehydrogenation of primary alcohol groups (i.e., promote glucose dialdehyde formation), while PtOx was found to promote oxygen transfer reactions (i.e., promote gluconic acid formation).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glucose oxidation can produce high value chemicals, but selectivity needs to be improved. Here we elucidate the role of the Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with a new analytical approach, using high&#8208;pressure liquid chromatography and high&#8208;pressure anion exchange chromatography. It was found that the type of oxidation, i.e. dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohol groups or oxygen transfer to aldehyde groups, strongly depends on the Pt oxidation state. Pt0 has a 7&#8208;fold higher activity for dehydrogenation reactions than for oxidation reactions, while PtOx is equally active for both reactions. Thus, Pt0 promotes glucose dialdehyde formation, while PtOx favors gluconate formation. The successive dehydrogenation of gluconate is achieved selectively at the primary alcohol group by Pt0, while PtOx also promotes the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohol groups, resulting in more complex reaction mixtures.

It was found that the type of oxidation, i.e. dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohol groups or oxygen transfer to aldehyde groups, strongly depends on the Pt oxidation state. Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has a 7-fold higher activity for dehydrogenation reactions than for oxidation reactions, while PtO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is equally active for both reactions.

         <title>Locating Hydrogen Positions for COF&#8208;300&#160;by Cryo&#8208;3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have wide&#8208;ranging applications, and their host&#8211;guest interactions play an essential role in the achievement of COF functions. To investigate these host&#8211;guest interactions, it is necessary to locate all atoms, especially hydrogen atoms. However, it is difficult to determine the hydrogen atomic positions in COFs because of the complexities in synthesizing high&#8208;quality large single crystals. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has unique advantages for the structural determination of nanocrystals and identification of light atoms. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogen atoms of a COF, not only on the framework but also on the guest molecule, can be located by 3D ED using continuous precession electron diffraction tomography (cPEDT) under cryogenic conditions. The host&#8211;guest interactions were clarified with the location of the hydrogen atoms. These findings provide novel insights into the investigation of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Active Chiral Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts with Suppressed Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8208;70% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Quinoidal Compounds with Good Air Stability and High Electrical Conductivity for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air stable n&#8208;type conductive molecules with high electrical conductivities and excellent device performance have important applications in organic electronics, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report three self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules, designated QnNs, with a closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone and alkyl amino chains of different lengths. The QnNs are self&#8208;doped via intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone. This process is ascertained unambiguously by experiments and theoretical calculations. The use of quinoidal structure effectively improves the self&#8208;doping level, and thus increases the electrical conductivity of self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules that achieved in a closed&#8208;shell structure from &#706; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 to &gt; 0.03 S cm&#8722;1. Besides, the closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure enables good air stability of QnNs with half&#8208;lives &gt; 73 days; and Q4N shows an electrical conductivity of 0.019 S cm&#8722;1 even after exposure to air for 120 days. When applying Q6N as the cathode interlayer in organic solar cells (OSCs), an outstanding power conversion efficiency of up to 18.2% was obtained, representing one the best results in binary OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Molecular Design for High&#8208;Performance Molecular Diodes Based on Pyridyl Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Better control of molecule&#8208;electrode coupling (&#915;) to minimize leakage current&#160;is an effective method to optimize the functionality of molecular diodes.&#160;Herein we embedded 5 isomers of phenypyridyl derivatives, each with an N atom placed at a different position, in two electrodes to fine&#8208;tune &#915; between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and top electrode of EGaIn (eutectic Ga&#8208;In terminating in Ga2O3). Combined with electrical tunnelling results, characterizations of electronic structures, single&#8208;level model fitting and DFT calculation, we found that the values of &#915; of SAMs formed by these isomers could be regulated by nearly 10 times, contributing to the leakage current changing for about two orders of magnitude and switching isomers from resistors to diodes with rectification ratio (r+ = |J(+1.5 V)/J(&#8722;1.5 V)|) exceeding 200.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Better control of molecule-electrode coupling (&#915;) to minimize leakage current&#160;is an effective method to optimize the functionality of molecular diodes.&#160;Herein we embedded 5 isomers of phenypyridyl derivatives, each with an N atom placed at a different position, in two electrodes to fine-tune &#915; between self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and top electrode of EGaIn (eutectic Ga-In terminating in Ga2O3). Combined with electrical tunnelling results, characterizations of electronic structures, single-level model fitting and DFT calculation, we found that the values of &#915; of SAMs formed by these isomers could be regulated by nearly 10 times, contributing to the leakage current changing for about two orders of magnitude and switching isomers from resistors to diodes with rectification ratio (r+ = |J(+1.5 V)/J(&#8722;1.5 V)|) exceeding 200. We demonstrated that the N atom placement can be chemically engineered to tune the resistive and rectifying properties of the molecular junctions, making it possible to convert molecular resistors into rectifiers. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of isomerism in molecular electronics and offers a new avenue for designing functional molecular devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2 to Acetate with 100&#8201;% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We substantiate the potential to utilize mechanical energy to piezocatalytic convert CO2 into C2 products, which is unprecedented. Tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts were served as piezocatalysts for the first time to convert CO2 into acetate under periodic ultrasonic waves, achieving 100&#8201;% selectivity and a yield up to 2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is the highest among reported studies.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100&#8201;% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8722;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8722; Modified Copper(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into copper clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters, which show high photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance.







Abstract
The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into the CuI clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8722;R)3)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xCH3CN (R=H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Substrate&#8211;Catalyst Halogen&#8211;Halogen Interactions for Boosting Enantioselectivity in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards boosted enantioselectivities in primary halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is presented. Fine&#8208;tuned multiple halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and halogen&#8208;bond (XB)&#8208;donor catalyst, through both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the incorporated halogen substituents, allows enantioselectivities of up to 90&#8201;% ee in model anion&#8208;binding&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reactions.







Abstract
A new approach towards highly enantioselective halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis has been developed. To circumvent the intrinsic issues of the nature of the halogen&#8208;bond (XB) and the resultant unresolved limitations in asymmetric catalysis, fine&#8208;tuned halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and XB&#8208;donor were designed to preorganize the substrate in the catalyst's cavity and boost enantiocontrol. The present strategy exploits both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the halogen substituent of the substrates to form a tight catalyst&#8211;substrate&#8211;counteranion chiral complex, thus enabling a controlled induction of high levels of chirality transfer. Remarkable enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 e.r. (90&#8201;% ee) have been achieved in a model dearomatization reaction of halogen&#8208;substituted (iso)quinolines with tetrakis&#8208;iodotriazole multidentate anion&#8208;binding catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented approach to isoxazoline aldoximes via the reactions of nitromethane and olefins is achieved. Nitromethane is electrochemically activated to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes.







Abstract
Activation of nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an interesting and meaningful but also challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that are prepared by four steps with the reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantage of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Metal Anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C through Eutectic Solvation Sheath in Chlorine&#8208;functionalized Eutectic Electrolytes with 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane</title>

A chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic electrolyte was proposed by exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with zinc (Zn) acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane for the construction of a unique eutectic solvation sheath, which contributes to the ideal regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating structure and ultra&#8208;stabilization of Zn anode at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The brain&#8208;storm of designing low&#8208;cost and commercialized eutectic electrolytes for zinc (Zn)&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage (ZEES) remains unresolved and attractive, especially when implementing it at low temperatures. Here, we report an appealing layout of advancing chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic (Cl&#8208;FE) electrolytes via exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with Zn acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and is prone to constitute Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes with a unique inner/outer eutectic solvation sheath for the better regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating neighboring and reconstruction of H&#8208;bonding. The side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% can be achieved over 1000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with Zn//Cu setups. By prototyping scale&#8208;up Zn&#8208;ion pouch cells using the optimal eutectic liquid of 3ZnOAc1.2Cl1.8&#8208;DOL, we obtain improved electrochemical properties at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a high capacitance of 203.9&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.02&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a range of 0.20&#8211;1.90&#8197;V and long&#8208;term cycling ability with 95.3&#8201;% capacitance retention at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 3,000&#8197;cycles. Overall, the proposal of ideal Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes guides the design of sub&#8208;zero and endurable aqueous ZEES devices and beyond.

         <title>Versatile Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxyfunctionalization for the Site&#8208; Selective and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases (AADs) are repurposed for applications in biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization. Activity profiling of natural AADs enabled the synthesis of four types of &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with broad scope, high efficiency, and good selectivity.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization, the insertion of an O&#8208;atom into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, streamlines the synthesis of complex molecules from easily accessible precursors and represents one of the most challenging tasks in organic chemistry with regard to site and stereoselectivity. Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization has the potential to overcome limitations inherent to small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated approaches by delivering catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity. Through enzyme repurposing and activity profiling of natural variants, we have developed a subfamily of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron dioxygenases that catalyze the site&#8208; and stereodivergent oxyfunctionalization of secondary and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, providing concise synthetic routes towards four types of 92 &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity. This method provides a biocatalytic approach for the production of valuable but synthetically challenging chiral hydroxy acid building blocks.

         <title>Integrated Cascade Nanozymes with Antisenescence Activities for Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activities is proposed. Providing cascade nanozyme MSe1 with antisenescence activities as a therapeutic intervention against oxidative stress in senescent cells provides a new treatment for atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Senescent cells are the critical drivers of atherosclerosis formation and maturation. Mitigating senescent cells holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In an atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, senescent cells interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting the disease development. Here, we hypothesize that a cascade nanozyme with antisenescence and antioxidant activities can serve as an effective therapeutic for atherosclerosis. An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, named MSe1, is developed in this work. The obtained cascade nanozyme can attenuate human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) senescence by protecting DNA from damage. It significantly weakens inflammation in macrophages and HUVECs by eliminating overproduced intracellular ROS. Additionally, the MSe1 nanozyme effectively inhibits foam cell formation in macrophages and HUVECs by decreasing the internalization of oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein. After intravenous administration, the MSe1 nanozyme significantly inhibits the formation of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (ApoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and then decreases the infiltration of inflammatory cells and senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques. This study not only provides a cascade nanozyme but also suggests that the combination of antisenescence and antioxidative stress holds considerable promise for treating atherosclerosis.

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of oxidation reaction kinetics of bulk Li2S was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators. Among them, phenyl ditelluride can significantly lower the charge overpotential, accelerate the redox reaction kinetics, and alleviate the shuttle effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x&gt;1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <dc:description>5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdoheme as a key intermediate of the heme catabolism. To reveal reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation reaction of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product via hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the generality of ring&#8208;opening reactivity as an oxaporphyrinium cation species.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8208;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but great challenge is lying in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8208;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8208;N4 sites decorated nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy on nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is strongly adsorbed on Fe1 site via vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1 s&#8208;1 turnover frequency, ~100% selectivity, 24 types of substrates adaptability). Our findings not only advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations but open a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo Responsive Electron and Proton Conductivity within a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of crystalline porous materials with coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer has not yet been reported to date. Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8208;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405 nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The electrical and mechanical properties of graphene&#8208;based materials can be tuned by the introduction of nanopores, which are sensitively related to the size, morphology, density, and location of nanopores. The synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional graphene nanostructures containing well&#8208;defined nonplanar nanopores has been challenging due to the intrinsic steric hindrance. Herein, we report the selective synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111), starting from a same precursor. The formation of distinct products on the two substrates originates from the different thermodynamics and kinetics of coupling reactions. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing the reaction pathways were proposed. In addition,&#160; the combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the electronic structures of porous graphene structures, demonstrating the impact of nonplanar pores on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;Based Separator with Interfacial Chemistry Regulation for Robust Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are ideal choices for high energy density storage system owing to the low electrochemical potential and low cost of K. However, the practical KMB applications suffer from intrinsically active K anode, which would bring serious safety concerns due to easier generation of dendrites. Herein, to explore a facile approach to tackle this issue, we propose to regulate K plating/stripping via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework. As a case study, the functional units of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Benefiting from these favorable features, uniform and stable K plating/stripping is realized with the regulated separator. Full battery assembled with the regulated separator showed ~19.9% higher discharge capacity than that with glass fiber separator at 20 mA g&#8208;1 and much better cycling stability at high rates. The generality of our approach is validated with KMBs using different cathodes and electrolytes. We envision that the strategy to suppress dendrite formation by commercial separator surface engineering using tailor&#8208;designed functional units can be extended to other metal/metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) cell for rapid concentration modulation and applied it to study the reaction pathway of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 at different time scales. We found that the reaction time could influence the reaction pathway. Multiple reaction mechanisms can be present under the same reaction conditions. At long reaction times, electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) play an important role.







Abstract
Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc., whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds, CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds, the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.

We found that the reaction time could influence the reaction pathway. Multiple reaction mechanisms can be present under the same reaction conditions. At long reaction times, electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) play an important role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc., whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by time-resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds, CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds, the redox properties of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying short-time kinetics for mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Driven Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a concept for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate that is driven by substoichiometric amounts of electrons, introduced electrochemically. This protocol enables access to a variety of nitro&#8208;derived molecules from unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, in addition to promoting ipso&#8208;nitration reactions and nitrative cyclizations with high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. The mechanism of the reaction is supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this reaction has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy to scale for decagram quantities, and exhibit exceptional substrate generality and functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Volatile Dual&#8208;Solvent Assisted Intermediate Phase Regulation for Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate is constructed with a dual&#8208;component volatile solvent. By suppressing the nucleation rate in volatile precursor, this strategy provides a controllable grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition without post&#8208;treatments.







Abstract
The unprecedented development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them one of the most promising candidates for terawatt&#8208;scale green energy production with low cost. However, the high boiling point solvents during the solution&#8208;processed film deposition cause anisotropic crystal growth and toxic solvent vapor during high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. Here, a dual&#8208;component green solvent consisting of isopropyl acetate and acetonitrile is proposed to form a volatile perovskite precursor, which can realize the high&#8208;quality perovskite thin film deposition by intermediate phase regulation. A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate phase is constructed with the engagement of isopropyl acetate as co&#8208;solvent, which suppresses the exploding nucleation rate in volatile perovskite precursor, providing a fine grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition. The corresponding PSCs fabricated by blade coating without anti&#8208;solvents or gas quenching achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37&#8201;% and 15.29&#8201;% for the areas of 14.08&#8197;cm2 and 37.83&#8197;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism for photocurrent generation is introduced utilizing an excited state proton transfer (ESPT) mechanism of photoacids and photobases. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer. Tandem irradiation of the photoacid&#8208;photobase results in polarity switching in an H&#8208;cell photoelectrochemical configuration.







Abstract
Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dictated Regiodivergent Allylic Functionalizations via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Substitution</title>

         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalizations were established via remote substitution, which provides a novel model for the seldomly studied migratory Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction. 1,4&#8208;Hydrofunctionalization of a conjugated diene intermediate was demonstrated to be feasible via a newly synthesized bisphosphine ligand.







Abstract
Different from classical allylic substitutions that require a vicinal leaving group, an olefin bearing a remote leaving group is scarcely viewed as a potential allylation substrate. Herein, we describe feasible protocols to achieve regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalizations via palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution, which provides a novel strategy for the seldomly studied migratory Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction. Dictated by a suitable ligand, a process that involved 4,3&#8208;hydrofunctionalization of the generated conjugated diene intermediate via metal walking is observed in generally &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 regioselectivity. Unexpectedly, a related 1,4&#8208;hydrofunctionalization pathway is found to be a major route with a newly synthesized electron&#8208;rich bisphosphine ligand, which challenges the conventional viewpoint on the potential regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalizations of linear internal conjugated dienes via &#951;3&#8208;substitution. A series of deuterium experiments and kinetic studies provide a preliminary insight into the potential catalytic cycle.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Optimization of Photochemical Reactions using Segmented&#8208;Flow Nanoelectrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry

         <dc:description>
Segmented&#8208;flow mass spectrometry was used to enable the rapid screening of nanomole&#8208;scale photoredox reactions for drug discovery. Nanoelectrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry analysis was carried out at throughputs as high as 2.9&#8197;samples/s, allowing for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) evaluation of prepared analogues.







Abstract
Within the realm of drug discovery, high&#8208;throughput experimentation techniques enable the rapid optimization of reactions and expedited generation of drug compound libraries for biological and pharmacokinetic evaluation. Herein we report the development of a segmented flow mass spectrometry&#8208;based platform to enable the rapid exploration of photoredox reactions for early&#8208;stage drug discovery. Specifically, microwell plate&#8208;based photochemical reaction screens were reformatted to segmented flow format to enable delivery to nanoelectrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry analysis. This approach was demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds, as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship evaluation of synthesized analogs. This technology is anticipated to expand the robust capabilities of photoredox catalysis in drug discovery by enabling high&#8208;throughput library diversification.

&lt;p&gt;Within the realm of drug discovery, high-throughput experimentation techniques enable the rapid optimization of reactions and expedited generation of drug compound libraries for biological and pharmacokinetic evaluation. Herein we report the development of a segmented flow mass spectrometry-based platform to enable the rapid exploration of photoredox reactions for early-stage drug discovery. Specifically, microwell plate-based photochemical reaction screens were reformatted to segmented flow format to enable delivery to nanoelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. This approach was demonstrated for the late-stage modification of complex drug scaffolds, as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship evaluation of synthesized analogs. This technology is anticipated to expand the robust capabilities of photoredox catalysis in drug discovery by enabling high-throughput library diversification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Grafting Expansion Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a trifunctional probe to combine covalent binding to the target protein, gel linkage and fluorescent labeling in one small molecule. Addition of the crosslinker AcX further increases the monomer density on the target surface. This results in increased grafting and thus higher retention of the fluorescent signal compared to a commercial dye that lacks the monomer group.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a recently developed technique that allows for the resolution of structures below the diffraction limit by physically enlarging a hydrogel&#8208;embedded facsimile of the biological sample. The target structure is labeled and this label must be retained in a relative position true to the original, smaller state before expansion by linking it into the gel. However, gel formation and digestion lead to a significant loss in target&#8208;delivered label, resulting in weak signal. To overcome this problem, we have here developed an agent combining targeting, fluorescent labeling and gel linkage in a single small molecule. Similar approaches in the past have still suffered from significant loss of label. Here we show that this loss is due to insufficient surface grafting of fluorophores into the hydrogel and develop a solution by increasing the amount of target&#8208;bound monomers. Overall, we obtain a significant improvement in fluorescence signal retention and our new dye allows the resolution of nuclear pores as ring&#8208;like structures, similar to STED microscopy. We furthermore provide mechanistic insight into dye retention in ExM.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Dendronized Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable luminescent radicals have been achieved by dendronization up to the fourth generation of tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radicals with carbazole groups. The emission blue&#8208;shifts from G2 (691&#8197;nm) to G4 (627&#8197;nm) as a result of reduced electron repulsion in the larger carbazole dendrons. The G4 dendrimer showed the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane solution.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;dendronized tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radicals have been synthesized. The photophysical properties of dendronized radicals up to the fourth generation were compared systematically to understand how structure&#8211;property relationships evolve with generation. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was found to increase with the increasing generation, and the fourth generation (G4TTM) in cyclohexane solution showed a PLQY as high as 63&#8201;% at a wavelength of 627&#8197;nm (in the deep&#8208;red region) from the doublet state. The dendron modification strategy also showed a blue&#8208;shift of the emission on increasing the generation number, and the photostability was also increased compared to the bare TTM radical.

         <title>Supramolecular Copolymers Under Kinetic, Thermodynamic, or Pathway&#8208;Switching Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and kinetic pathways of IrIII complex monomers has led to their block co&#8208;assembly through kinetic control and pathway&#8208;switching control, respectively. The well&#8208;defined block microstructure has been characterized by TEM and SEM. The present research approach will be an important step forward in the study of the self&#8208;assembly of small molecules that can form crystalline assemblies.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities. However, the co&#8208;assembly strategies to construct co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules with well&#8208;defined sequence structures are still limited, especially for more complex crystalline block co&#8208;assemblies. Herein, we target this challenge by designing IrIII complexes 1 and 2, which possess unique self&#8208;assembly pathways and are capable of forming crystalline assemblies in aqueous systems. Specifically, block and random co&#8208;assemblies of 1 and 2 can be synthesized by kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. Meanwhile, by adjusting the water content to orthogonalize the on&#8208;pathway and the off&#8208;pathway, an unprecedented pathway&#8208;switching approach is realized to synthesize block and random co&#8208;assemblies. By coupling the kinetic pathways, the present co&#8208;assembly strategies are expected to pave the way for the synthesis of crystalline co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules and the construction of organic heterostructures.

         <title>Modulation of Uptake and Reactivity of Nitrogen Dioxide in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Materials</title>

The reactivity of NO2 is modulated in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3, which leads to reaction between NO2 and framework Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A higher NO2 dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) via the sequential templating approach (STA) is elucidated, which is dominated by concentration waves of precursors. These significant insights into STA will usher in a new era for this burgeoning field, inspiring the development of precise, novel synthetic methods to uncover more smart dynamic behaviors of HoMS.







Abstract
Hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS), a new family of hierarchical nano/micro&#8208;structured materials, have evoked intensive studies to discover their unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering features. The theoretical understanding of the general synthetic methods of HoMS, i.e. the sequential templating approach (STA), makes it possible to understand, predict, and control the shell formation process. Herein, a mathematical model is established based on the experiment results, which reveal the appearance of concentration waves in the STA. The numerical simulation results not only correspond well to the experimental observations but also explain the regulation methods. Whereby, the underlying physical essence of STA is elucidated, suggesting that HoMS is the concrete representation of the concentration waves. Thereafter the formation of HoMS is not limited to the solid&#8208;gas reactions through high&#8208;temperature calcination, but could be extended to solution systems under low&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Construction of Boron&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Nanoporous &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Activation</title>

Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;enriched nanoporous &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks were constructed by an ionothermal procedure. The obtained materials demonstrated profound H2 activation/dissociation capabilities and promising hydrogenation activities.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;enriched scaffolds have demonstrated unique features and promising performance in the field of catalysis towards the activation of small gas molecules. However, there is still a lack of facile approaches capable of achieving high B doping and abundant porous channels in the targeted catalysts. Herein, construction of boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;enriched nanoporous &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks (BN&#8208;NCNs) was achieved via a facile ionothermal polymerization procedure with hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile [HAT(CN)6] sodium borohydride as the starting materials. The as&#8208;produced BN&#8208;NCN scaffolds were featured by high heteroatoms doping (B up to 23&#8197;wt.&#8201;% and N: up to 17&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) and permanent porosity (surface area up to 759&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 mainly contributed by micropores). With the unsaturated bonded B species acting as the active Lewis acid sites and defected N species acting as the active Lewis base sites, those BN&#8208;NCNs delivered attractive catalytic performance towards H2 activation/dissociation in both gaseous and liquid phase, acting as efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysts in hydrogenation procedures.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion through Coupling Spin Crossover and Rhombus Deformation in a Hexanuclear {FeIII4FeII2} Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexanuclear spin crossover compound [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1) was synthesized by assembling the spin crossover FeII units and asymmetric Ppmp ligands into a rhombic core structure. It showed the colossal positive and negative anisotropic thermal expansion coupled with spin transition.







Abstract
Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1, Tp*=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp=2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent thermally&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Rh on High&#8208;Index CeO2 Facet for Highly Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new atom&#8208;trapping process in a confined space for anchoring isolated Rh atoms on the high&#8208;Index {210} facets of CeO2. Benefiting from the unique capability of CeO2 {210} in generating oxygen vacancies, the obtained catalysts exhibit outstanding catalytic CO oxidation performance.







Abstract
Reducible oxide&#8208;supported noble metal nanoparticles exhibit high activity in catalyzing many important oxidation reactions. However, atom migration under harsh reaction conditions leads to deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, single&#8208;atom catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability, but often suffer from poor catalytic activity owing to the ionized surface states. In this work, we simultaneously address the poor activity and stability issues by synthesizing highly active and durable rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;atom catalysts through a &#8220;wrap&#8208;bake&#8208;peel&#8221; process. The pre&#8208;coated SiO2 layer during synthesis of catalyst plays a crucial role in not only protecting CeO2 support against sintering, but also donating electron to weaken the Ce&#8722;O bond, producing highly loaded Rh single atoms on the CeO2 support exposed with high&#8208;index {210} facets. Benefiting from the unique electronic structure of CeO2 {210} facets, more oxygen vacancies are generated along with the deposition of more electropositive Rh single atoms, leading to remarkably improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation.

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system is a photocatalytic proximity labeling system on the cell surface, which enables a more efficient capture of physically interacting cells. This system can be employed to identify trace cellular interactions and serves as a &#8220;live&#8221; TCR multimer to discriminate dendritic cells presenting different antigens, which paves the way for exploring the heterogeneity of antigen&#8208;presenting cells.







Abstract
Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on primary cells. Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.

&lt;p&gt;The Ru-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-hydrazide system is a photocatalytic proximity labeling system on the cell surface, which enables a more efficient capture of physically interacting cells. This system can be employed to identify trace cellular interactions and serves as a &#8220;live&#8221; TCR multimer to discriminate dendritic cells presenting different antigens, which paves the way for exploring the heterogeneity of antigen-presenting cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell-cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet-oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru-mediated PPL. Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; catalysts with different cell-anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on primary cells. Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR-T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni/LaInO3 was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal CO2 conversion with a high CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. LaInO3 was enriched with extensive oxygen vacancies to adsorb CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway and the photoinduced charge transfer process to reduce the reaction active energy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>An Implantable Fiber Biosupercapacitor with High Power Density by Multi&#8208;Strand Twisting Functionalized Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable fiber biosupercapacitor with high power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is created by design of a multi&#8208;strand twisted structure. It can be successfully operated in vivo and is demonstrated to achieve the electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve.







Abstract
Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants. Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise as a power source in vivo.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major cause of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitation during battery resting, usually attributed to protons. To tackle DO&#8208;induced issues, a chemical strategy for self&#8208;deoxygenation is proposed. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive, effectively improving the stability of Zn in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period. In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 1100&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6&#8201;%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Nucleation of a Crystalline Silicate Framework via a Structurally Precise Prenucleation Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ characterizations reveal a multi&#8208;step crystallization pathway for cyclosilicate hydrate crystals that starts with the formation of structurally precise prenucleation clusters, which comprise the secondary building units of this framework lattice.







Abstract
Hierarchical nucleation pathways are ubiquitous in the synthesis of minerals and materials. In the case of zeolites and metal&#8211;organic frameworks, pre&#8208;organized multi&#8208;ion &#8220;secondary building units&#8221; (SBUs) have been proposed as fundamental building blocks. However, detailing the progress of multi&#8208;step reaction mechanisms from monomeric species to stable crystals and defining the structures of the SBUs remains an unmet challenge. Combining in situ nuclear magnetic resonance, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we show that crystallization of the framework silicate, cyclosilicate hydrate, occurs through an assembly of cubic octameric Q38 polyanions formed through cross&#8208;linking and polymerization of smaller silicate monomers and other oligomers. These Q38 are stabilized by hydrogen bonds with surrounding H2O and tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+). When Q38 levels reach a threshold of &#8776;32&#8201;% of the total silicate species, nucleation occurs. Further growth proceeds through the incorporation of [(TMA)x(Q38)&#8901;n&#8201;H2O](x&#8722;8) clathrate complexes into step edges on the crystals.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Conjugated Dienes with Tertiary Silanes Controlled by Hemilabile Hybrid P,O Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hemilabile P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, are developed. The use of P,O ligands has not only significantly improved reactivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes but has also achieved an unprecedented regioselectivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed diene functionalization towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation.







Abstract
Novel P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, were synthesized and utilized in Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation involving tertiary silanes, unactivated alkenes, and conjugated dienes. The ligand displayed a remarkable level of reactivity for alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes and its use resulted in a significant improvement in the regioselectivity of diene hydrosilylation towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, with coordination of phosphorus and oxygen. Control experiments provided evidence for the formation of Pd0 species and the reversibility of Pd&#8722;H insertion in the reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) computations supported the importance of the hemilabile P,O ligand in stabilizing both the rate&#8208;determining transition state of Pd&#8722;H insertion and the transition state of reductive elimination that determines the regioselectivity.

         <title>Optically Controlled Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Protein Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible approach for the preparation of photo&#8208;responsive three&#8208;dimensional protein crystals is reported by using a light&#8208;sensitive cationic azobenzene dye. Adjusting the azobenzene dye isomerization kinetics realizes control over the crystal domain size: while direct mixing the two components yields small crystallites, reducing the isomerization rate of the azobenzene eventually leads to the formation of protein single crystals.







Abstract
Protein crystallization is an important tool for structural biology and nanostructure preparation. Here, we report on kinetic pathway&#8208;dependent protein crystals that are controlled by light. Photo&#8208;responsive crystallites are obtained by complexing the model proteins with cationic azobenzene dyes. The crystalline state is readily switched to a dispersed phase under ultraviolet light and restored by subsequent visible&#8208;light illumination. The switching can be reversibly repeated for multiple cycles without noticeable structure deterioration. Importantly, the photo&#8208;treatment not only significantly increases the crystallinity, but creates crystallites at conditions where no ordered lattices are observed upon directly mixing the components. Further control over the azobenzene isomerization kinetics produces protein single crystals of up to &#8776;50&#8197;&#956;m. This approach offers an intriguing method to fabricate metamaterials and study optically controlled crystallization.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable van der Waals Heterostructures through Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method is demonstrated for the preparation of high&#8208;quality van der Waals heterostructures in solution through an electrochemical strategy. The produced van der Waals heterostructures exhibit strong interlayer coupling, extraordinary structural integrity, large lateral dimension and good optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWHs) have recently gained widespread attention because of their abundant and exotic properties, which open up many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, practical applications remain challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput techniques for fabricating high&#8208;quality vdWHs. Here, we demonstrate a general electrochemical strategy to prepare solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;quality vdWHs, in which electrostatic forces drive the stacking of electrochemically exfoliated individual assemblies with intact structures and clean interfaces into vdWHs with strong interlayer interactions. Thanks to the excellent combination of strong light absorption, interfacial charge transfer, and decent charge transport properties in individual layers, thin&#8208;film photodetectors based on graphene/In2Se3 vdWHs exhibit great promise for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection, owing to a high responsivity (267&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), fast rise (72&#8197;ms) and decay (426&#8197;ms) times under NIR illumination. This approach enables various hybrid systems, including graphene/In2Se3, graphene/MoS2 and graphene/MoSe2 vdWHs, providing a broad avenue for exploring emerging electronic, photonic, and exotic quantum phenomena.

         <title>Stabilizing Interfaces in High&#8208;Temperature NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries via Tuning Terminal Alkyl Chains of Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that by extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes can be improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at 1&#8197;M. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich SEI/CEI is achieved. The surface phase transition and structural degradation of the NCM811 cathode are also alleviated.







Abstract
Ether electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries. Despite the intensive research in recent years, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ether electrolytes still cannot form reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in NCM811&#8208;Li batteries at diluted concentrations, especially in those operating at elevated temperatures. We report a simple but effective strategy to break this bottleneck and stabilize interfaces in high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li batteries in ether electrolytes. We propose that by gradually extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes is improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at a concentration of 1&#8197;M. Accordingly, the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208; /cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. Additionally, the surface phase transition and structural degradation of NCM811 cathode are alleviated. Consequently, in the ethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte, the Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8722;Cu cells working at 60&#8201;&#176;C is boosted to 99.41&#8201;% with a cycling life of over 200&#8197;cycles. The lifespan of high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li cells is prolonged by more than 400&#8201;% with a stable average Coulombic efficiency of 99.77&#8201;% at quasi&#8208;practical conditions of 50&#8197;&#956;m Li, lean electrolyte of 10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1, and medium&#8208;high cathode loading of &gt;2.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Quantitative Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging were used to measure vesicle size and vesicular isotopic dopamine content in cellular vesicles. Measurements before and after stimulated exocytotic release show the fraction of chemical release is independent of vesicle size.







Abstract
We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.

         <title>Regulation of Atomic Fe&#8208;Spin State by Crystal Field and Magnetic Field for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen electrocatalysis on iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts is highly correlated to the spin configuration of Fe active sites. A crystal field and magnetic field synergetic strategy is proposed to regulate spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C from low spin (LS) to intermediate spin (MS) and high spin (HS), and the high spin FeIII&#8722;N&#8722;C is the most favorable for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;active and low&#8208;cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution are essential in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries, and single atom catalysts with Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C are promising candidates. However, the activity still needs to be boosted, and the origination of spin&#8208;related oxygen catalytic performance is still uncertain. Herein, an effective strategy to regulate local spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C through manipulating crystal field and magnetic field is proposed. The spin state of atomic Fe can be regulated from low spin to intermediate spin and to high spin. The cavitation of dxz and dyz orbitals of high spin FeIII can optimize the O2 adsorption and promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*O2 to *OOH). Benefiting from these merits, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst displays the highest oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery displays a high power density of 170&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good stability.

         <title>An ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Mediates Disulfide Migration in the Biosynthesis of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide in pretrichodermamide A involves the formation of an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by the oxygenase TdaR containing the canonical CXXC motif, followed by disulfide migration by the oxygenase TdaE containing a specialized CXXQ motif, via an ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate. The enzymatic cascade reactions can be considered as a general catalytic mechanism for &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs).







Abstract
The transannular disulfide functions as a key structural element imparting diverse biological activities to epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs). Although mechanisms were proposed in previous studies, &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in ETPs is not well&#8208;determined owing to the failure to identify the hypothetical intermediate. Herein, we characterize the key ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM) intermediate and prove its involvement in the carbon&#8208;sulfur migration from an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208; to an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by elucidating pretrichodermamide A biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a FAD&#8208;dependent thioredoxin oxygenase TdaE harboring a noncanonical CXXQ motif. Biochemical investigations of recombinant TdaE and mutants demonstrated that the construction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide was initiated by Gln140 triggering proton abstraction for generation of the essential o&#8208;QM intermediate, accompanied by &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy elimination. Subsequent attack on the &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by Cys137 led to disulfide migration and spirofuran formation. This study expands the biocatalytic toolbox for transannular disulfide formation and sets the stage for the targeted discovery of bioactive ETPs.

         <title>Robust and Wide Temperature&#8208;Range Zinc Metal Batteries with Unique Electrolyte and Substrate Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical zinc metal battery with high coulombic efficiency and long cycle life over a wide temperature range was constructed by using a weakly solvating &#947;&#8208;valerolactone&#8208;based electrolyte and a nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate with chemical stability and good homogenized electron/ion distribution.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by harsh issues such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a unique design strategy using &#947;&#8208;valerolactone&#8208;based electrolyte and nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate was reported to solve the above problems. The electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal capacitors can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000&#8197;cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C with 66&#8201;% depth of discharge and 1200&#8197;cycles at 80&#8201;&#176;C with 50&#8201;% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;photoluminescent (PL) CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). The MSCs evolve from their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are relatively transparent in optical absorption. The non&#8208;absorbing PCs assist the transformation of the absorbing MSCs. Monomer substitution is involved in the PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization, and monomer addition in the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor II&#8211;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at &#8776;322&#8197;nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373&#8197;nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Non-photoluminescent (PL) CdS MSC-322 transforms to PL CdS MSC-328 and MSC-373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). The MSCs evolve from their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are relatively transparent in optical absorption. The non-absorbing PCs assist the transformation of the absorbing MSCs. Monomer substitution is involved in the PC-322 to PC-328 quasi-isomerization, and monomer addition in the PC-328 to PC-373 transformation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal semiconductor II&#8211;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic-size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL-inactive MSCs transform to the PL-active ones is unknown. We show that PL-inactive CdS MSC-322 transforms to PL-active CdS MSC-328 and MSC-373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC-322 displays a sharp absorption at &#8776;322&#8197;nm, whereas MSC-328 and MSC-373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373&#8197;nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1-octadecene, MSC-322 develops; with HOAc, MSC-328 and MSC-373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC-322 to PC-328 quasi-isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC-328 to PC-373 transformation.

         <title>A Chemically Bonded Ultraconformal Layer between the Elastic Solid Electrolyte and Lithium Anode for High&#8208;performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach to build a lithiophilic surface on elastic rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in a ultraconformal, chemically bonded, mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical operation. Lithium metal batteries containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.







Abstract
Although high ionic conductivities have been achieved in most solid&#8208;state electrolytes used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport between solid&#8208;state electrolytes and lithium anodes remains a great challenge due to the high interfacial impedances and infinite volume changes of metallic lithium. In this work, a chemical vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach is developed to establish a lithiophilic surface on rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in the formation of a resilient, ultrathin, and mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical cycling. The resulting ultraconformal layer chemically connects the electrolyte and lithium anode and maintains dynamic contact during operation, thus facilitating rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport across interfaces, as well as promoting uniform lithium deposition and inhibiting side reactions between electrolyte components and metallic lithium. LMBs containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.

         <title>Covalent Scrambling in Porous Polyarylthioethers through a Stepwise SNAr for Tunable Bandgap and Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conventional polycondensation reaction can provide the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Controlling the temperature orients the reaction toward the regioselective multi&#8208;substitution of aryl fluorides, demonstrating a stepwise change in the porosity and optical band gap of the poly(aryl thioether)s.







Abstract
Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur&#8208;aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols. Here, we report a simple, one&#8208;pot, inexpensive, regioselective synthesis of highly porous poly(aryl thioether)s through polycondensation of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide. The unprecedented temperature&#8208;dependent para&#8208;directing formation of thioether linkages leads to a stepwise transition of the polymer extension into a network, thereby allowing fine control of the porosity and optical band gaps. The obtained porous organic polymers with ultra&#8208;microporosity (&lt;1&#8197;nm) and sulfur as the surface functional groups show size&#8208;dependent separation of organic micropollutants and selective removal of mercury ions from water. Our findings offer easy access to poly(aryl thioether)s with accessible sulfur functionalities and higher complexity, which will help in realizing advanced synthetic designs in applications such as adsorption, (photo)catalysis, and (opto)electronics.

An innovative intramolecular oxidative coupling between a ketone and a Weinreb amide was developed for the assembly of the complex 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure of sarpagine alkaloids. Precise late&#8208;stage functional&#8208;group manipulation of the ketone and the Weinreb amide enabled the divergent synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;trinervine, (+)&#8208;vellosimine, (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C.







Abstract
Sarpagine alkaloids are bioactive indole natural products that contain a highly rigid indole&#8208;fused 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, more than 100 members of which have been identified. Herein, a detailed examination of the intramolecular oxidative coupling between a ketone and a Weinreb amide for assembling the complex 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure of sarpagine family alkaloids is described. Precise late&#8208;stage manipulations of the ketone and Weinreb amide enable the divergent syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;trinervine, (+)&#8208;vellosimine, (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C. Other notable transformations of the synthesis featured an aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/indole cyclization cascade to generate the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane structure, a regioselective elimination reaction to form the ethylidene motif embedded in the (+)&#8208;vellosimine and (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B structures, and a diastereoselective indole oxidative rearrangement to form the spirooxindole structure in (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Bio&#8208;Based Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Furanic Platforms as Biomass Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we overcome current limitations of biomass furanic platforms, namely the lack of sustainable nitrogen in cellulose&#8208;based furfurals and the lack of reactivity of chitin&#8208;based ones. To this end, a tandem dehydration/oxidative cleavage of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine delivers a new nitrogen&#8208;rich furfural. We further demonstrate the utility of the new furan as a valuable monomer for synthetic chemistry and as a bioconjugation tool.







Abstract
The demand for new biomass&#8208;derived fine and commodity chemicals propels the discovery of new methodologies and synthons. Whereas furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural are cornerstones of sustainable chemistry, 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;acetyl furan (3A5AF), an N&#8208;rich furan obtained from chitin biomass, remains unexplored, due to the poor reactivity of the acetyl group relative to previous furanic aldehydes. Here we developed a reactive 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;furfuryl aldehyde (3A5F) and demonstrated the utility of this synthon as a source of bio&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;rich heteroaromatics, carbocycles, and as a bioconjugation reagent.

Here we developed a reactive 3-acetamido-5-furfuryl aldehyde (3A5F) and demonstrated the utility of this synthon as a source of bio-derived nitrogen-rich heteroaromatics, carbocycles, and as a bioconjugation reagent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8211;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8211;glass composite membrane prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler produces a monolithic structure that eliminates non&#8208;selective grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential ultrahigh C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569 GPU and C2H6/C2H4 paraffin/olefin selectivity of 7.16.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8211;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569&#8197;gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.

         <title>Revealing Excited&#8208;State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>

Excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and its stretching vibrations were detected in real time by femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing were the Pt&#8722;Pt distance and the ligand orientation, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states.







Abstract
Photoexcited molecular trajectories on potential energy surfaces (PESs) prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8722;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8722;Pt bond length and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated PESs of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited&#8208;state trajectories involving multiple excited&#8208;state PESs.

         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy combining the cation redox regulation and cation interaction regulation was reported to address the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and phase transition issues existing in layered cathodes. Impressively, our proposed cathode realized excellent cycling stability with an extremely low strain change of 0.53&#8201;%, even under deep sodium extraction/insertion operation conditions.







Abstract
Deep sodium extraction/insertion of sodium cathodes usually causes undesired Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and phase transition, both of which will reduce structural stability and lead to poor long&#8208;cycle reliability. Here we report a zero&#8208;strain P2&#8208; Na2/3Li1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 cathode, in which the lithium/cobalt substitution contributes to reinforcing the host structure by reducing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox, mitigating the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and minimizing the lattice change. 94.5&#8201;% of Na+ in the unit structure can be reversibly cycled with a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na). Impressively, a solid&#8208;solution reaction without phase transitions is realized upon deep sodium (de)intercalation, which poses a minimal volume deviation of 0.53&#8201;%. It attains a high discharge capacity of 178&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high energy density of 534&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and excellent capacity retention of 95.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 250&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Electrodes With Sensing Membranes Covalently Attached to Both the Inert Polymer Substrate and Conductive Carbon Contact</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical delamination limits sensor lifetimes and is a major limitation to long&#8208;term monitoring with ion selective electrodes. To address this problem, we developed a photografting polymerization method that simultaneously attaches the sensing membrane covalently to both inert polymeric electrode bodies and carbon conductors. This improves not only the lifetime but also reduces signal drift and reduces the need for recalibration.







Abstract
The use of solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) is of interest to many clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. However, upon extended exposure to samples and under thermal and mechanical stress, adhesion between these membranes and underlying substrates often weakens gradually. Eventually, this results in the formation of a water layer at the interface to the underlying electron conductor and in delamination of the membrane from the electrode body, both major limitations to long&#8208;term monitoring. To prevent these problems without increasing the complexity of design with a mechanical attachment, we use photo&#8208;induced graft polymerization to simultaneously attach ionophore&#8208;doped crosslinked poly(decyl methacrylate) sensing membranes covalently both to a high surface area carbon as ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transducer and to inert polymeric electrode body materials (i.e., polypropylene and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene)). The sensors provide high reproducibility (standard deviation of E0 of 0.2&#8197;mV), long&#8208;term stability (potential drift 7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 over 260&#8197;h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121&#8201;&#176;C, 2.0&#8197;atm for 30&#8197;min). For this work, a covalently attached H+ selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.

&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.2&#8197;mV), long-term stability (potential drift 7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 260&#8197;h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121&#8201;&#176;C, 2.0&#8197;atm for 30&#8197;min). For this work, a covalently attached H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diarylmethylamines by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8208;H Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMAs) via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation was reported. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;fueled Mechanical Motions with Dynamic Phosphorescence Induced by Topochemical [2+2] Reactions in Organoboron Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/sun light enables fast macroscopic photomechanical motions and blue&#8208;shifted phosphorescence emission, owing to quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions, in stoichiomorphic organoboron crystals. X&#8208;ray photodiffraction structural mapping of photosalient crystals, during rapid topochemical transformation, deciphers an atomic&#8208;level mechanism for the origin of the photomechanical motions.







Abstract
In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal&#8208;free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, and all&#8208;organic electronic devices. Such green energy&#8208;triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid&#8208;base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light associated with quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light&#8208;promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue&#8208;shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time&#8208;dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X&#8208;ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light&#8208;driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;functional crystalline materials.

         <title>Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and efficient synthetic method produces conjugatable sterically shielded heptamethine cyanine dyes for in vivo NIR&#8208;I or NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. The fluorochromes are enclosed by two flanking straps which enhance fluorescence brightness and chemical stability, prevent dye stacking on the surface of an antibody, and enable high performance fluorescence imaging of a mouse tumor.







Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800&#8208;1 have been tested in humans. However, long&#8208;term imaging protocols using ZW800&#8208;1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800&#8208;1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor&#8208;targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+, Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles was followed using in situ X&#8208;ray scattering. The experiments reveal the kinetics of particle growth (small&#8208;angle scattering) and phase transformation (wide&#8208;angle scattering). A surprising particle size evolution is observed, where &#945;&#8208;phase particles develop a bimodal size distribution before they transform into &#946;&#8208;phase.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8208;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a unimodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to unimodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.

The multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DOBDiKTa merges the motifs of boron&#8208;based and ketone&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Using this molecular design, this compound shows deep blue, narrowband emission. The co&#8208;host device with DOBDiKTa achieved a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;% and blue emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12).







Abstract
Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they can simultaneously harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light in the device and show very narrow emission spectra, which translates to excellent color purity. Here, we report the first example of an MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron (DOBNA) and those containing carbonyl groups (DiKTa) as acceptor fragments in the MR&#8208;TADF skeleton. The resulting molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband pure blue emission and efficient TADF character. The co&#8208;host OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiKTa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a high color purity, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer vesicles deform their shape gradually with every breath they take. SO2 gas reacting with the cyanine species in polymersomes can drive a continuous 1D stretching motion of membranes that transforms them to tubesomes. Such a membrane plastic deformation process can be programmed by SO2 level, which will well regulate the membrane permselectivity to realize transmembrane traffic management towards cargos of different size.







Abstract
Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.

         <title>Highly Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Tetra&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Enamido Phosphorus Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation of congested tetra&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphorus derivatives was developed by employing commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos as the catalyst. This protocol offers a straightforward entry to a broad variety of previously difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphonates/phosphine oxides bearing two vicinal stereocenters embedded in various ring structures.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of enamido phosphorus derivatives is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of chiral amino phosphorus products, among which the congested tetra&#8208;substituted substrates remains an unaddressed challenge. In this study, we utilize a commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos system for the efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a wide set of tetra&#8208;substituted cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphonates/phosphine oxides, thus enabling access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphorus compounds featuring two vicinal stereocenters. This protocol was broadly applicable to different ring systems possessing various phosphonate/phosphine oxide groups and further applied in the preparation of amino&#8208;phosphine ligands. DFT mechanistic explorations indicate that the C=C migratory insertion into RhIII&#8722;H bond could be the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step. The origins of stereoselectivity are revealed through distortion/interaction analysis, which is primarily regulated by distinguished dispersion interactions and steric repulsions.

         <title>Light Triggered Pore Size Tuning in Photoswitching Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Low Energy CO2 Capture</title>

The UV light triggered CO2 capture and release upon photoisomerization of azobenzene pendants inside the pore channel of PCTF2 is reported.







Abstract
Recently, photo switching porous materials have been widely reported for low energy costed CO2 capture and release via simply remoted light controlling method. However, most reported photo responsive CO2 adsorbents relied on metal organic framework (MOFs) functionalisation with photochromic moieties, and MOF adsorbents still suffered from chemically and thermally unstable issues. Thus, further metal free and highly stable organic photoresponsive adsorbents are necessary to be developed. CTFs, because of their high porosity and stability, have attracted great attention for CO2 capture. Considering the high CO2 uptake capacity and structural tunability of CTFs, it suggests high potential to fabricate the photoswitching CTF materials by the same functionalisation method as MOFs. Herein, the first series of photo switching CTFs were developed for low energy CO2 capture and release. Apart from that, the CO2 switching efficiency could be doubled either through the azobenzene numbers adjusting method or through the previously reported structural alleviation strategy. Furthermore, the pore size distribution of azobenzene functionalised PCTFs also could be tuned under UV exposure, which may contribute to the UV light induced decrease of CO2 uptake capacity. These photoswitching CTFs represented a new kind of porous polymers for low energy costed CO2 capture.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr)/nickel foam with abundant mesoporous pores enables the progressive conversion of NO into nitrate without releasing remarkable NO2 by refining the reactive oxygen species to &#8901;OH and can achieve the simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants through a flow photoanode reactor. This study provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for NO removal and sustainable nitrate storage.







Abstract
The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study demonstrates that this bottleneck can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr) (Ni@NU) using nickel foam (NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8901;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82&#8201;% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3&#8197;V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99&#8201;% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90&#8201;% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.

&lt;p&gt;The Ni-modified NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66(Zr)/nickel foam with abundant mesoporous pores enables the progressive conversion of NO into nitrate without releasing remarkable NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by refining the reactive oxygen species to &#8901;OH and can achieve the simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants through a flow photoanode reactor. This study provides a state-of-the-art strategy for NO removal and sustainable nitrate storage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low-toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study demonstrates that this bottleneck can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on Ni-modified NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66(Zr) (Ni@NU) using nickel foam (NF) as a three-dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas-phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8901;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82&#8201;% of NO without releasing remarkable NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under a low bias voltage (0.3&#8197;V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99&#8201;% for long-term use. Through calculation, 90&#8201;% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state-of-the-art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NO&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Covalently Grafting Graphene onto Si Photocathode to Expedite Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin graphene film was closely and tightly grafted onto Si semiconductor via a chemical method. The resulting cathode manifested high kinetics and excellent stability for aqueous photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Silicon semiconductor functionalized with molecular catalysts emerges as a promising cathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the limited kinetics and stabilities remains a major hurdle for the development of such composites. We herein report an assembling strategy of silicon photocathodes via chemically grafting a conductive graphene layer onto the surface of n+&#8208;p Si followed by catalyst immobilization. The covalently&#8208;linked graphene layer effectively enhances the photogenerated carriers transfer between the cathode and the reduction catalyst, and improves the operating stability of the electrode. Strikingly, we demonstrate that altering the stacking configuration of the immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) catalyst through calcination can further enhance the electron transfer rate and the PEC performance. At the end, the graphene&#8208;coated Si cathode immobilized with CoTPP catalyst managed to sustain a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent of &#8722;1.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 16&#8197;h for CO production in water at a near neutral potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. This represents a remarkable improvement of PEC CO2RR performance in contrast to the reported photocathodes functionalized with molecular catalysts.

         <title>Nanostructure&#8208;Driven Indocyanine Green Dimerization Generates Ultra&#8208;Stable Phototheranostics Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Indocyanine Green (ICG) stabilized nanoemulsion enables 100&#8201;% ICG dimerization and J&#8208;aggregation spontaneously on its shell to afford a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) that demonstrates superior photothermal conversion efficiency, photostability, and structure stability over ICG, giving an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform for photoacoustic imaging and effective photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye approved for clinical use. Despite its versatility in photonic applications and potential for photothermal therapy, its photobleaching hinders its application. Here we discovered a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) generated by using ICG to stabilize nanoemulsions, after which ICG enabled complete dimerization on the nanoemulsion shell, followed by J&#8208;aggregation of ICG&#8208;dimer, resulting in a narrow, red&#8208;shifted (780&#8197;nm&#8594;894&#8197;nm) and intense (&#8776;2&#8208;fold) absorbance. Compared to ICG, Nano&#8208;dICG demonstrated superior photothermal conversion (2&#8208;fold higher), significantly reduced photodegradation (&#8722;9.6&#8201;% vs. &#8722;46.3&#8201;%), and undiminished photothermal effect (7 vs. 2&#8197;cycles) under repeated irradiations, in addition to excellent colloidal and structural stabilities. Following intravenous injection, Nano&#8208;dICG enabled real&#8208;time tracking of its delivery to mouse tumors within 24&#8197;h by photoacoustic imaging at NIR wavelength (890&#8197;nm) distinct from the endogenous signal to guide effective photothermal therapy. The unprecedented finding of nanostructure&#8208;driven ICG dimerization leads to an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform.

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH layers to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our correlative multimodal approach can link local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, morphology and composition of surface species formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that a 6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) layer, grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, contains more hydroxyl ions and easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites, exhibiting a higher OER activity than 3&#8197;nm thick &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) formed on [02
&#8208;oriented Co.







Abstract
The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0), grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than &#8776;3&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) or &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02
&#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of gem&#8208;Dihaloalkanes and Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopropane derivatives are essential in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Their synthesis commonly relies on asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo compounds, potentially explosive and needing stabilizing substituents. Thus, asymmetric catalytic transformations of non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non&#8208;linear effect, and UV/Vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.

Distinct from previous approaches, &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non-stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non-linear effect, and UV/Vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical-polar crossover.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macroscopic Assembly of Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Metal&#8208;free Supramolecular Glasses for Enhanced Color&#8208;tunable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized chiral metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses using L&#8208;histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as the building blocks can be obtained through a facile solution fabrication process. Visible color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence emissions are successfully realized in these glasses (namely L&#8208;H&#8208;M and L&#8208;H&#8208;M&#8208;AC). AC: acetonitrile; R.T.: room temperature; UV: Ultra Violet.







Abstract
Glassy materials, with desirable mechanical rigidity, shaping ability, high transparency, are attracting great interest in diverse fields. However, optically bulk molecule&#8208;based glasses are still rare, mainly due to limited monomeric species and harsh preparation conditions. Herein, we report a facile bottom&#8208;up solution fabrication process to obtain metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses (SMGs) at the macroscopic scale using L&#8208;Histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as building blocks. The chiral SMGs possess color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (decay lifetime up to 141.2&#8197;ms) and circular polarized luminescence (g factor up to 8.7&#215;10&#8722;3). The strong hydrogen bonds effectively drive the formation of SMGs, and provide a rigid microenvironment to boost triplet exciton generation. By virtue of excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent ultralong phosphorescence of the SMGs, applications including multicolored displays, visual UV detection, and persistently luminescent thermometer are demonstrated.

         <title>A Triply [5]Helicene&#8208;Bridged (1,3,5)Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,3,5)cyclophane has been synthesized, in which the triply locked central benzene rings are parallel to each other, perfectly superimposed and rather close. These two benzene rings show abnormally low aromaticity, which is possibly due to the existence of an aromatic 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron macrocyclic circuit.







Abstract
A rigid propeller&#8208;shaped conjugated triple macrocycle consisting of two nearly perfectly stacked benzene rings and three linking [5]helicene moieties has been synthesized using a glyoxylic Perkin approach. Analysis of the electron delocalization in this atypical aromatic molecule revealed global aromaticity and a 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuit along the edge of its triple loop, to the detriment of the two 6&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuits in the two stacked benzene rings.

A polycondensation reaction constitutes the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Through a multi&#8208;para&#8208;nucleophilic substitution of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide, temperature&#8208;dependent formation of thioether linkages leads to stepwise transition of the polymers into network structures with controllable porosity and bandgap, as reported by Jeehye Byun, Sheng Li, Cafer&#8197;T. Yavuz, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202304378).

Crystal&#8208;lattice&#8208;guided anisotropic etching with two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework crystals was employed to sculpt hierarchically organized fractal pore patterns that allow for a high loading of molecular catalysts to be exposed at broad and robust pore edges for efficient photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Details of this research are presented by Chang&#8197;Yun Son, In&#8197;Su Lee et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202303890).

Luminescent radicals are gathering constant attention as a new class of luminescent materials due to the ground and excited state doublet character. In their Research Article (e202302550), Ken Albrecht and co&#8208;workers report a carbazole dendronized luminescent tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical. Dendron modification increases the photostability and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane. The image shows the red luminescent raspberry (TTM radical) protected from sunshine by the raspberry bush (dendron).

         <title>Who Binds Better? Let Alphafold2 Decide!</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chang and Perez suggest a simple and elegant approach for using AlphaFold2 to determine relative binding preferences of a receptor for two of its peptide substrates: when presented with both peptides, AlphaFold2 models only the stronger binder into the binding site. This easy approach will help many biologists to quickly estimate best binders and accelerate research on peptide substrate&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind's Alphafold2, structural models of high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins and many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partner(s), and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glassy state of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) has recently been identified, exhibiting diverse properties complementary to the crystalline state. This mini review presents an overview of the structural chemistry of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOIPs, and a comprehensive discussion on their glass formation processes. Current advances in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are discussed, and an outlook for the future of this new family of materials is offered.







Abstract
Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non&#8208;crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long&#8208;range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state. This mini review describes the chemical diversity of both three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional crystalline HOIPs and demonstrates how glasses are produced from these materials. Specifically, current achievements in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are highlighted. We conclude with our perspective on the future of this new family of materials.

         <title>Expanding Linker Dimensionality in Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks for sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Control for Separation Applications</title>

Increasing linker dimensionality in metal&#8208;organic frameworks limits the effects of linker orientation and structural flexibility on pore size, ultimately enhancing the separation capabilities of these materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3&#8208;Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D&#8208;linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D&#8208;linkers and the misconceived high&#8208;cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D&#8208;linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D&#8208;linkers in MOF synthesis.

         <title>Micromolar Affinity and Higher: Synthetic Host&#8211;Guest Complexes with High Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review collects recent achievements in the design of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with association constants exceeding 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Hints are provided for the design of future receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
The design of high&#8208;affinity synthetic host&#8211;guest complexes is of paramount importance because they are key elements in constructing unprecedented supramolecular assemblies, functional materials, molecular probes, artificial signal transduction events, and interfaces with the biological world. The present review article collects recent achievements in the design of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with outstanding stabilities, i.e., exceeding 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Different solvents and different types of noncovalent interactions are considered for the stabilization of the complexes. Finally, some hints are provided for the design of future synthetic receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.

         <title>Membrane Electrode Assembly for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Principle and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>

Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are a promising technology to realize carbon neutrality. This review summarizes the principles and core components of the electrolyser and gives an overview of the application of MEAs in the generation of different reduced products.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is a promising technology. Gaseous CO2 can be directly transported to the cathode catalyst layer, leading to enhanced reaction rate. Meanwhile, there is no liquid electrolyte between the cathode and the anode, which can help to improve the energy efficiency of the whole system. The remarkable progress achieved recently points out the way to realize industrially relevant performance. In this review, we focus on the principles in MEA for CO2RR, focusing on gas diffusion electrodes and ion exchange membranes. Furthermore, anode processes beyond the oxidation of water are considered. Besides, the voltage distribution is scrutinized to identify the specific losses related to the individual components. We also summarize the progress on the generation of different reduced products together with the corresponding catalysts. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are highlighted for future research.

         <title>Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccine&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via decorating immunostimulatory small&#8208;molecule resiquimod (R848) on the chiral framework R/S&#8208;paracyclophane, we synthesized planar&#8208;chiral enantiomers R/S&#8208;ResP. For SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccine, in comparison to R&#8208;ResP, S&#8208;ResP exhibited a significant enhancement for vaccine&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various viral strains. This study revealed the importance of enantioselective effect in the design and construction of chiral small molecule adjuvants.







Abstract
Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S&#8208;ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S&#8208;ResP exhibits a 4.05&#8208;fold higher affinity for toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R&#8208;ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S&#8208;ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains compared to R&#8208;ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine&#8208;induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.

         <title>Digital Microfluidics and Magnetic Bead&#8208;Based Intact Proteoform Elution for Quantitative Top&#8208;down Nanoproteomics of Single C.&#8197;elegans Nematodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a sensitive microfluidics&#8208;based workflow for quantitative top&#8208;down proteomics of single nematodes of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (containing &lt;1000&#8197;cells). Here, nematodes are lysed on digital microfluidics chips, and proteins aggregated with magnetic beads are eluted off with formic acid. Using differential ion mobility mass spectrometry, we could quantify changes in the proteoform abundances of single nematodes.







Abstract
While most nanoproteomics approaches for the analysis of low&#8208;input samples are based on bottom&#8208;up proteomics workflows, top&#8208;down approaches enabling proteoform characterization are still underrepresented. Using mammalian cell proteomes, we established a facile one&#8208;pot sample preparation protocol based on protein aggregation on magnetic beads and intact proteoform elution using 40&#8201;% formic acid. Performed on a digital microfluidics device, the workflow enabled sensitive analyses of single Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, thereby increasing the number of proteoform identifications compared to in&#8208;tube sample preparation by 46&#8201;%. Label&#8208;free quantification of single nematodes grown under different conditions allowed to identify changes in the abundance of proteoforms not distinguishable by bottom&#8208;up proteomics. The presented workflow will facilitate proteoform&#8208;directed analysis on samples of limited availability.

         <title>Rearrangements of Internally&#8208;bridged Octaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1)s to Porphyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally&#8208;bridged octaphyrin underwent skeletal rearrangement to meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin dimer upon ZnII metalation. This reaction was indeed triggered by hydride&#8208;addition reaction to lead to thermodynamically more stable porphyrin framework. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin rearranged to meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946;, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked porphyrin dimer via a similar mechanism combined with Pd&#8208;mediated reductive coupling.







Abstract
Internally&#8208;bridged octaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1) underwent a rearrangement to meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin dimer as a new metamorphosis. Extensive examination suggests that hydride&#8208;addition is a key step for the rearrangements to afford thermodynamically more stable porphyrin framework. Further, &#946;&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin was transformed to meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946;, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked porphyrin dimer via a similar mechanism combined with Pd&#8208;mediated reductive homocoupling.

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic living polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH) with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator in cyclohexane is possible. It is a key question whether the monomer acts as a 1,3&#8208;diene or as a styrenic monomer. The cyclic structure of the 1,2&#8208;substituted monomer shows extraordinary consequences on copolymerization behavior, microstructure and thermal behavior, compared to other conventional linear dienes (e.g. butadiene, isoprene).







Abstract
We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25&#8201;&#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272;&lt;1.07&#8211;1.20). In situ 1H NMR kinetic characterization revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty=2.55, rVCH=0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64&#8201;:&#8201;36). It was demonstrated that the microstructure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78&#8201;%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid polymers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.

         <title>Cyclization of an Achiral Flipping Panel to Homochiral Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of homochiral macrocycles were facilely constructed by cyclization of a dynamic flipping thianthrene moiety with methylene linkages. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the enantiomers and leads to luminescent molecular tubes exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Regulation of the luminescence could be further achieved through supramolecular binding towards electron&#8208;deficient guests.







Abstract
Macrocyclization of the bendable 2,7&#8208;dimethoxythianthrene with methylene linkages afforded a pair of homochiral macrocycles featuring a hex&#8208;nut&#8208;like geometry. Their structures were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the pair of enantiomers which could be readily derivatized. Installing phenylethynyl groups on their rims leads to luminescent tubular macrocycles exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with a large dissymmetry value |glum| of 5&#215;10&#8722;3. Supramolecular binding of electron&#8208;deficient guests by the tube results in fluorescence quenching, which proved its potential for the future development of switchable chiroptical systems.

         <title>Bispalladium(II) Complexes of di&#8208;p&#8208;Pyrirubyrin Derivatives as Promising Near&#8208;Infrared Photoacoustic Dyes</title>

         <dc:description>
We show the synthesis and mutually reversible, fully controlled transformations of bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrins. The regioselective conversion of di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin into dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin leads to the incorporation of an unprecedented &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocycle skeleton. Significantly, all reported compounds have outstanding spectroscopic properties, including a photoacoustic response in the near&#8208;infrared I&#8211;II range.







Abstract
The insertion of palladium(II) into di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin results in mutually convertible bimetallic complexes. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of one of them yielded bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin and, after demetallation, dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin, introducing for the first time the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocyclic frame. Bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 6, bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 9, and dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 10 absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (9) the wavelength of Yb&#8208;based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.

         <title>Sculpting In&#8208;plane Fractal Porous Patterns in Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF Nanocrystals for Photoelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

A well&#8208;controlled crystal lattice&#8208;guided anisotropic etching of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF surfaces gives perforated hierarchical pore patterns that allow high&#8208;loading of molecular catalysts exposed at the pore&#8208;edges for efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Herein, by choosing few&#8208;nm&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals of MOF&#8208;5 containing in&#8208;planner square lattices as a modular platform, a crystal lattice&#8208;guided wet&#8208;chemical etching has been rationally accomplished. As a result, two attractive pore patterns carrying Euclidean curvatures; precisely, plus(+)&#8208;shaped and fractal&#8208;patterned pores via &#10216;100&#10217; and &#10216;110&#10217; directional etching, respectively, are regulated in contrast to habitually formed spherical&#8208;shaped random etches on MOF surface. In agreement with the theoretical calculations, a diffusion&#8208;limited etching process has been optimized to devise high&#8208;yield of size&#8208;tunable fractal&#8208;pores on the MOF surface that tenders for a compatibly high payload of catalytic ReI&#8208;complexes using the existing large edge area once modified into a free amine&#8208;group&#8208;exposed inner pore surface. Finally, on benefiting from the long&#8208;range fractal opening in 2D MOF support structure, while loaded on an electrode surface, a facilitated cross&#8208;interface charge&#8208;transportation and well&#8208;exposure of immobilized ReI&#8208;catalysts are anticipated, thus realizing enhanced activity and stability of the supported catalyst in photoelectrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction.

         <title>Catalytic Photoinduced Intramolecular Decarboxylative and Desulfonylative sp3 Allylation Enabled by Sulfinate Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced intramolecular decarboxylative and desulfonylative sp3 allylation of allyl esters or sulfones enabled by simple, yet available, sulfinate catalysts is described herein. This technique complements classical protocols based on noble Pd catalysts and also facilitates rapid and reliable access to molecular architectures of utmost relevance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a catalytic intramolecular decarboxylative/desulfonylative sp3 allylation triggered by sulfinate salts under light irradiation. The reaction is likely enabled by a non&#8208;classical, radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, allowing rapid and reliable access to valuable allyl architectures from readily accessible precursors. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and scalability, employing abundant, commercially available catalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new upcycling strategies to address the threats from waste plastics can significantly improve global sustainability. An atom economic reaction was demonstrated to convert polyesters into diols with great selectivity over a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. The reaction could be operated in solvent&#8208;free mode with all atoms in the reactants fixed into the final product, eliminating the need for a separation process.







Abstract
The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99.5&#8201;%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.

         <title>Birefringence Regulation by Clarifying the Relationship Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Optical Anisotropy in Tin&#8208;based Ternary Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;performance relationship has been teased out between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy for analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides.







Abstract
It is important to establish and clarify the relationship between stereochemically active lone pairs and birefringence, since it is one of the significantly effective routes to explore birefringent crystals by introducing Sn&#8208;centered polyhedra with stereochemically active lone pairs. Herein, four tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides A3SnCl5 and ASn2Cl5 (A=NH4 and Rb) have been synthesized successfully. The experimental birefringence of Rb3SnCl5 and RbSn2Cl5 is larger than or equal to 0.046 and 0.123@546&#8197;nm, respectively. Through investigating the alkali or alkaline&#8208;earth metal tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides, the structure&#8208;performance relationship has been concluded between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy. It is beneficial to the analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin&#8208;based halides and provides a guide for exploring tin(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic functional materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones with Two Non&#8208;vicinal Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction used for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters is reported. This method has the power to not only produce both diastereoisomers with excellent enantioselectivities but can also provide selectively a single diastereoisomer or all four diastereoisomers depending on the conditions.







Abstract
Chiral heterocycles with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important skeletons in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocycles, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The well&#8208;designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide one single diastereoisomer by taking advantage of the epimerization effect but also to synthesize all four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands L2 and L2&#8242; having opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;nickel migration process from aryl to alkenyl groups is now reported for the first time. The alkenyl nickel intermediates generated by this highly stereoselective migration process can be coupled with brominated alkanes to form multisubstituted olefins. The current method provides a new and efficient approach for the synthesis of Z/E olefins with high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl nickel 1,4&#8208;migration (1,4&#8208;Ni migration) reaction has been reported for the first time. The generated alkenyl Ni species undergo a reductive coupling reaction with unactivated brominated alkanes affording a series of trisubstituted olefins. This tandem reaction exhibits mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity, and excellent Z/E stereoselectivity. A series of controlled experiments have shown that the critical 1,4&#8208;Ni migration process is reversible. In addition, the alkenyl nickel intermediates obtained after migration are highly Z/E stereoselective and do not undergo Z/E isomerization. The obtained trace isomerization products are caused by the instability of the product.

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon nanorings with excellent photophysical and chiroptical properties have been synthesized. Importantly, Chiral ternary complexes, consisted of chiral carbon nanorings, 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and protonated chiral amines, display excellent narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for protonated chiral amines.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrate that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants of up to 3.31&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 depending on the chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while the heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ones have a constant CD signal compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, which suggests that homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively. Finally, the chiral ternary complexes can be further applied to determine the ee values of chiral guests. The findings highlight a new application of carbon nanorings in supramolecular sensors, beyond the common recognition of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Discovery of the Azaserine Biosynthetic Pathway Uncovers a Biological Route for &#945;&#8208;Diazoester Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the &#945;&#8208;diazoester natural product azaserine is reported. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments implicate generation of a hydrazonoacetic acid intermediate that is oxidized and transferred to l&#8208;serine. This pathway represents a distinct biosynthetic strategy for diazo formation.







Abstract
Azaserine is a bacterial metabolite containing a biologically unusual and synthetically enabling &#945;&#8208;diazoester functional group. Herein, we report the discovery of the azaserine (aza) biosynthetic gene cluster from Glycomyces harbinensis. Discovery of related gene clusters reveals previously unappreciated azaserine producers, and heterologous expression of the aza gene cluster confirms its role in azaserine assembly. Notably, this gene cluster encodes homologues of hydrazonoacetic acid (HYAA)&#8208;producing enzymes, implicating HYAA in &#945;&#8208;diazoester biosynthesis. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments support this hypothesis. These discoveries indicate that a 2&#8208;electron oxidation of a hydrazonoacetyl intermediate is required for &#945;&#8208;diazoester formation, constituting a distinct logic for diazo biosynthesis. Uncovering this biological route for &#945;&#8208;diazoester synthesis now enables the production of a highly versatile carbene precursor in cells, facilitating approaches for engineering complete carbene&#8208;mediated biosynthetic transformations in vivo.

         <title>Functionalization of Olefinic C&#8722;H Bonds by an Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Coupling Sequence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift process with further subsequent selective reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide variety of electrophiles has been developed. This 1,4&#8208;nickel migration/reductive coupling sequence provides a facile access to diverse alkenyl C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized products under mild conditions and with overall good selectivity.







Abstract
An attractive approach to selective functionalization of remote C&#8722;H bonds is a metal/hydride shift/cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence. Complimentary to the heavily exploited 1,2&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp3 chain, a chain&#8208;walking process, the 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp2 chain is more complex. Here we report an unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift reaction, in which the migratory alkenylnickel species generated in situ is selectively trapped by one of various coupling partners, such as isocyanates, alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides or alkynyl bromides, allowing regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to trisubstituted alkenes. In contrast to the well&#8208;reported ipso&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, this strategy provides remote alkenyl C&#8722;H functionalized products with good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity.

In contrast to the well-reported &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-aryl coupling reactions, this strategy provides remote alkenyl C&#8722;H functionalized products with good yield and with excellent chemo-, regio- and &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement of Diaryliodonium Salts in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement featuring an aryl transfer from I to C pathway was developed, where no metal&#8208; or photo&#8208;catalysts are needed. The interaction between ionic liquids and diaryliodonium salts largely contributed to the efficiency of the reaction under mild conditions. This method furnished 64&#8197;examples of sulfonyl substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as potentially valuable building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is an intramolecular SNAr reaction, enabling the formation of a new arene carbon&#8208;carbon bond with sufficiently strong carbon&#8208;centered nucleophile. Reported here are ortho&#8208;tosylmethylene functionalized diaryliodonium salts, which can undergo an unprecedented Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement in ionic liquids, resulting in sulfonyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as a powerful class of building blocks in chemical synthesis. The protocol features aryliodo moiety as a hyper nucleofuge, facilitating the formation of Meisenheimer complex within the migratory system.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of a protic ionic liquid N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) on Co3O4&#8722;x can improve the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttle protons and construct a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment. In this way the simultaneous promotion of reactivity and selectivity of the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia reaction can be realized.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500&#8197;ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8722;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23&#177;4.97&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and 84.74&#177;3.43&#8201;% at &#8722;1.71 and &#8722;1.41&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8722;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; as well as the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.

         <title>Pnictogen Interactions with Nitrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular rotors were designed to experimentally measure the transition state stabilizing abilities of nitrogen pnictogen interactions. The rotors formed intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions in the bond rotation transition states. Many common nitrogen functional groups were observed to form stabilizing interactions including amides, imines, and nitro groups.







Abstract
Stabilizing nitrogen pnictogen bond interactions were measured using molecular rotors. Intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions were formed in the bond rotation transition states which lowered the rotational barriers and increased the rates of rotation, as measured by EXSY NMR. The pnictogen interaction energies show a very strong correlation with the positive electrostatic potential on nitrogen, which was consistent with a strong electrostatic component. In contrast, the NBO perturbation and pyramidalization analyses show no correlation, suggesting that the orbital&#8208;orbital component is minor. The strongest C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N pnictogen interactions were comparable to C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions and were stronger than C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph interactions, when measured using the same N&#8208;phenylimide rotor system. The ability of the nitrogen pnictogen interactions to stabilize transition states and enhance kinetic processes demonstrates their potential in catalysis and reaction design.

         <title>Structural Switching of a Distorted Trigonal Metal&#8208;Organic Cage to a Tetragonal Cage and Singlet Oxygen Mediated Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distorted trigonal cage 1 was synthesized by a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. 1 exhibited a complete structural switching in the presence of C70 to form tetragonal complex (C70)2@2. The acetonitrile&#8208;soluble PF6&#175; analogue of (C70)2@2 was found to act as an excellent photosensitizer and catalyzed singlet oxygen mediated oxidation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8211;organic cages with unique architecture and guest binding abilities is highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage&#8197;(1) from a twisted tetratopic ligand (L) and a PdII acceptor. Surprisingly, 1 exhibited a complete structural reorganization of its building units in the presence of C70 and C60 to form guest&#8208;encapsulated tetragonal cages, (C70)2@2 and (C60)2@2, respectively. These guest&#8208;bound cages were found to be potential 1O2 generators, with the former effectively catalyzing two different varieties of 1O2&#8208;mediated oxidation reactions.

         <title>Tin(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient, Selective Reduction of CO2 to Formate under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrated selective CO2 photoreduction into formate. This MOF is an environmentally benign material containing only earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic elements such as tin, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, but shows high formate generation selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and apparent quantum yield (9.8&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Certain metal complexes are known as high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction photocatalysts driven by visible light. However, most of them rely on rare, precious metals as principal components, and integrating the functions of light absorption and catalysis into a single molecular unit based on abundant metals remains a challenge. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which can be regarded as intermediate compounds between molecules and inorganic solids, are potential platforms for the construction of a simple photocatalytic system composed only of Earth&#8208;abundant nontoxic elements. In this work, we report that a tin&#8208;based MOF enables the conversion of CO2 into formic acid with a record high apparent quantum yield (9.8&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm) and &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity without the need for any additional photosensitizer or catalyst. This work highlights a new MOF with strong potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction driven by solar energy.

         <title>Free Amino Group Transfer via &#945;&#8208;Amination of Native Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino group transfer strategy was developed to install free NH2 to the &#945;&#8208;position of native carbonyls under mild conditions. The resulting primary &#945;&#8208;aminated products are amenable to in situ peptide coupling or Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization in one&#8208;pot procedures. We anticipate this method to provide a general platform towards the synthesis of amines, ultimately opening exciting avenues in the synthesis and medicinal study of peptidomimetics.







Abstract
We report herein a straightforward transfer of a free amino group (NH2) from a commercially available nitrogen source to unfunctionalized, native carbonyls (amides and ketones) resulting in direct &#945;&#8208;amination. Primary &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls are readily produced under mild conditions, further enabling diverse in situ functionalization reactions&#8212;including peptide coupling and Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization&#8212;that capitalize on the presence of the unprotected primary amine.

         <title>Dynamic Zn/Electrolyte Interphase and Enhanced Cation Transfer of Sol Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as one of the promising anodes of aqueous batteries possesses the notable advantages, but it faces severe challenges from serious side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Herein, ultrathin nanosheets of &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive. The nanosheets not only create a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn, but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. Benefited from the enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase, the pouch cells of Zn||LiMn2O4 using this electrolyte show the remarkably improved electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, i.e. Zn powders as the Zn anode, limited N/P ratio, high mass loading, and wide temperatures. The results expand the materials available for this dynamic interphase, provide the insightful understanding about the enhanced charge transfer in the electrolyte, and realize the combination of dynamic interphase and enhanced kinetics for all&#8208;climate performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Polymerization of a Side&#8208;Chain Transformable Bulky Acrylamide Monomer and Subsequent PPM for Syntheses of Isotactic Polyacrylate and Polyacrylamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report syntheses of isotactic polyacrylate and polyacrylamide via a stereospecific radical polymerization of a pendant&#8208;transformable monomer, acrylamide carrying isopropyl&#8208;substituted ureidosulfonamide (1), followed by post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM). The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (2) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron&#8208;withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit 1 revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et3N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of 1 in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60 &#730;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et3N. Thus&#8208;obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [m = 74%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (m = 51%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually m was increased up to 93%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso&#8208;specific radical polymerization of 1 gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).</dc:description>

         <title>Fast&#8208;Response Nickel&#8208;Promoted Indium Oxide Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation from Intermittent Solar Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of a "net&#8208;zero&#8208;emission" system through CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with solar energy is an eco&#8208;friendly way to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Traditional CO2 hydrogenation demands centralized mass production for cost reduction with mass water electrolysis for hydrogen supply. To achieve continuous reaction with intermittent and fluctuating flow of H2 on small&#8208;scale for distributed application scenarios, modulating the catalyst interface environment and chemical adsorption capacity to adapt fluctuating reaction conditions is highly desired. This paper describes a distributed clean CO2 utilization system in which the surface structure of catalysts is carefully regulated. The Ni catalyst with unsaturated electrons loaded on In2O3 can reduce the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2 supply, exhibiting a faster response (12 min) than bare oxide catalysts (42 min). Moreover, the introduction of Ni enhances the sensitivity of catalyst to hydrogen, enabling Ni/In2O3 catalyst with a good performance at lower H2 concentrations with a 15 times adaptability for wider hydrogen fluctuation range than In2O3, greatly reducing the negative impact of unstable H2 supplies from renewable energies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot method for enantioselective C&#8211;H allylation of pyridines at C3 via tandem borane and palladium catalysis. This method involves borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration to generate dihydropyridines, then palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dihydropyridines with allylic esters, and finally air oxidation of the allylated dihydropyridines to afford the products. This method enables the introduction of an allylic group at C3 with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;type Polymers in Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type polymers are polymeric semiconducting materials that conduct holes and have extensive applications in optoelectronics such as organic photovoltaics. Taking the advantage of intrinsic discontinuous light absorption of organic semiconductors, semitransparent organic photovoltaics (STOPVs) present compelling opportunities in various potential applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics, automobiles and wearable electronics. The characteristics of p&#8208;type polymers, including optical, electronic and morphological properties, determine the performance of STOPVs, and the requirements for p&#8208;type polymers differ between opaque organic photovoltaics and STOPVs. Hence, in this Minireview, recent advances of p&#8208;type polymers used in STOPVs are systematically summarized, with emphasis on the effects of chemical structures, conformation structures and aggregation structures of p&#8208;type polymers on the performance of STOPVs. Furthermore, new design concepts and guidelines are also proposed for p&#8208;type polymers to facilitate the future development of high&#8208;performance STOPVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Organoboron Species as Lewis Superacids and Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA &gt; SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA &gt; B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8226;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN) = 47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A (3+2) annulation reaction has been used to synthesize diazulenorubicenes (DARs), non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings. These compounds show red&#8208;shifted absorptions, low LUMO energies, aromaticity switching, and high charge mobilities up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, on&#8208;surface synthesis with the DAR compounds leads to large non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized by a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes, and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2&#8201;b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19&#8197;rings was achieved through on&#8208;surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

In this work, we demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The cycling stability shows an inverse relationship with the thickness of the NiO surface layer. Simulation analysis further indicates that the slower Li+ diffusivity of NiO mainly accounts for the performance decay of the cathode.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal LiNixCoyMnzO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x+y+z=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.

         <dc:description>
The large shift in luminescent properties between near&#8208;infrared and visible emissions without any loss in quantum yield was achieved by massive structural changes of an organic&#8211;inorganic luminescent hybrid.







Abstract
We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749&#8197;nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561&#8197;nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones via Tandem Allylboration/Lactonization: a Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via a tandem allylboration/lactonization approach was achieved using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex. The kinetic resolution of the allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization was found to be a key aspect responsible for the success of this transformation. Stereodivergent syntheses and total syntheses of eupomatilones 2, 5 and 6 proved its synthetic utility.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.

A one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH3 for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2 allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3 to exclusively afford trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, this reaction can be rendered asymmetric by using an enantioenriched borane&#8208;based catalyst derived from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene to give rise to enantioenriched trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with almost complete diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A wide substrate scope, good tolerance of diverse functionality and up to 20&#8208;gram scale production are demonstrated. The enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are achieved by the judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane. The catalytic pathway and the origin of the excellent stereoselectivity are elucidated by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.

The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)2/dpephos and Co(acac)2/xantphos, respectively. The ring&#8208;opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;&#8208;C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access synthetically versatile skipped diboronates with catalysts generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and dpephos or xantphos. A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.

         <title>Designs of Tandem Catalysts and Cascade Catalytic Systems for CO2 Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the design principles and development of tandem catalysts for CO2 upgrading to C2+ chemicals by CO2RR, as well as the cascade catalytic systems to tandem&#8208;utilize the C2+ products from CO2RR and achieve their subsequent conversion to higher order compounds. The current challenges in cascade CO2RR systems are discussed and potential approaches for future developments are outlined.







Abstract
Upgrading CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds through the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a practical approach to mitigate atmospheric CO2 while simultaneously producing high value chemicals. The reaction pathways for C2+ production involve multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and C&#8722;C coupling processes. By increasing the surface coverage of adsorbed protons (*Had) and *CO intermediates, the reaction kinetics of PCET and C&#8722;C coupling can be accelerated, thereby promoting C2+ production. However, *Had and *CO are competitively adsorbed intermediates on monocomponent catalysts, making it difficult to break the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of the *Had/*CO intermediate. Recently, tandem catalysts consisting of multicomponents have been developed to improve the surface coverage of *Had or *CO by enhancing water dissociation or CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO production on auxiliary sites. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles of tandem catalysts based on reaction pathways for C2+ products. Moreover, the development of cascade CO2RR catalytic systems that integrate CO2RR with downstream catalysis has expanded the range of potential CO2 upgrading products. Therefore, we also discuss recent advancements in cascade CO2RR catalytic systems, highlighting the challenges and perspectives in these systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene and Diazocine Molecular Photoswitches: Self&#8208;Assembly, Responsive Materials and Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as versatile molecular photoswitches beyond azobenzenes. In this minireview, we highlight some of the most promising azo&#8208;based molecular photoswitches (arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines and diazocines) and discuss their application in supramolecular assembly, responsive materials and photopharmacology.







Abstract
Aromatic units tethered with an azo (&#8722;N=N&#8722;) functionality comprise a unique class of compounds, known as molecular photoswitches, exhibiting a reversible transformation between their E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers in response to photo&#8208;irradiation. Photoswitches have been explored extensively in the recent past to prepare dynamic self&#8208;assembled materials, optoelectronic devices, responsive biomaterials, and more. Most of such materials involve azobenzenes as the molecular photoswitch and to date, SciFinder lists more than 7000&#8197;articles and 1000&#8197;patents. Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been invested to improve the photo&#8208;isomerization efficiency and related mesoscopic properties of azobenzenes. Recently, azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes, such as arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines, and diazocines, have emerged as second generation molecular photoswitches beyond conventional azobenzenes. These photoswitches offer distinct photoswitching behavior and responsive properties which make them highly promising candidates for multifaceted applications ranging from photoresponsive materials to photopharmacophores. In this minireview, we introduce the structural refinement and photoresponsive properties of azoheteroarenes and diazocines and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art on utilizing these photoswitches as responsive building blocks in supramolecular assembly, material science and photopharmacology, highlighting their versatile photochemical behavior, enhanced functionality, and latest applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and azetidine&#8208;forming [2+2] cycloadditions (aza&#8208;Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions) of sulfonylimines are presented. The divergent reactivity was achieved though substrate modulation. In both cases, the reactions lead to the synthesis of complex polycyclic scaffolds from simple components. The mechanistic details and the utility of the products are described.







Abstract
The synthesis of polycyclic compounds is of high interest due to the prevalence of these motifs in drugs and natural products. Herein, we report on the stereoselective construction of 3D bicyclic scaffolds and azetidine derivatives by modulation of N&#8208;sulfonylimines to achieve either [4+2]&#8208; or [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. The utility of the method was established by further modulation of the product. Mechanistic studies are also included, which support reaction via Dexter energy transfer.

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit&#8208;Identification in a Rigid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for ppm&#8208;Level CO2 Removal and Ultra&#8208;Pure CO Enrichment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atypical thermoresponsive feature is incorporated into a rigid Mg&#8208;MOF, which realizes ppm&#8208;level CO2 capture and ultra&#8208;pure CO enrichment (&#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at elevated working temperature. The property is demonstrated by comprehensive in situ variable&#8208;temperature tests showing outstanding performance in syngas purification and CO upgrading through an induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification mechanism.







Abstract
Removing CO2 from crude syngas via physical adsorption is an effective method to yield eligible syngas. However, the bottleneck in trapping ppm&#8208;level CO2 and improving CO purity at higher working temperatures are major challenges. Here we report a thermoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8201;a&#8208;apz), assembled by rigid Mg2(dobdc) (1&#8201;a) and aminopyrazine (apz), which not only affords an ultra&#8208;high CO2 capacity (145.0/197.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.01/0.1&#8197;bar) at 298&#8197;K) but also produces ultra&#8208;pure CO (purity &#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at a practical ambient temperature (TA). Several characterization results, including variable&#8208;temperature tests, in situ high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;SXRD), and simulations, explicitly unravel that the excellent property is attributed to the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification in 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz that comprises self&#8208;adaption of apz, multiple binding sites, and complementary electrostatic potential (ESP). Breakthrough tests suggest that 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz can remove CO2 from 1/99 CO2/CO mixtures at practical 348&#8197;K, yielding 70.5&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of CO with ultra&#8208;high purity of &#8805;99.99&#8201;%. The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H2/N2/CH4/CO/CO2 (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).

The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic RNA Deprotection and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the pore size of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystal into the mesopore regime (2 to 50&#8197;nm) not only allows RNA molecules to enter but also their chemical conversion within the pores. The orderly aligned metal sites in the pores efficiently catalyse the removal of propargyl carbonate protecting groups from the RNA, restoring their original bioactivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with mespores (2 to 50&#8197;nm) allows the inclusion of large biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. However, chemical reaction on the nucleic acids, to further regulate their bioactivity, is yet to be demonstrated within MOF pores. Here, we report the deprotection of carbonate protected RNA molecules (21 to 102&#8197;nt) to restore their original activity using a MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst. Two MOFs, MOF&#8208;626 and MOF&#8208;636 are designed and synthesized, with mesopores of 2.2 and 2.8&#8197;nm, respectively, carrying isolated metal sites (Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru). The pores favor the entrance of RNA, while the metal sites catalyze C&#8722;O bond cleavage at the carbonate group. Complete conversion of RNA is achieved by Pd&#8208;MOF&#8208;626, 90&#8197;times more efficiently than Pd(NO3)2. MOF crystals are also removable from the aqueous reaction media, leaving a negligible metal footprint, 3.9&#8197;ppb, only 1/55 of that using homogeneous Pd catalysts. These features make MOF potentially suited for bioorthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Thiamyxins A&#8211;C and Thiamyxin E, a Potent Class of RNA&#8208;Virus&#8208;Inhibiting (Cyclo)depsipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first total synthesis of thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and E, an interesting group of natural products with antiviral activity and an acid&#8208;labile C2 exomethine position, is described. Overcoming the problem of inseparable diastereomers of the open&#8208;chain variants, thiamyxin&#8197;C and E were obtained by opening the cyclic thiamyxins&#8197;A and B.







Abstract
We present the first total synthesis of the thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and the now fully characterized thiamyxin&#8197;E, an interesting class of thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich depsipeptides with diverse antiviral activity. The synthesis features a parallel closing of two methyl thiazoline units, with low epimerization of the very labile adjacent stereocenter. It also includes the three&#8208;step synthesis of an uncommon hydroxy acid and the oxidation&#8208;free elimination of a phenylselenide to form a dehydroalanine moiety. The exploitation of the acid&#8208;labile stereocenter at the isoleucine moiety and the reopening of the macrolactones gave access to the four thiamyxins with good yields and diastereomeric purities from a single precursor. The modular total synthesis allows further testing of the biological activity and gives opportunities to explore the pharmacophore and antiviral target through derivatization.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy of Chiral Molecular Crystals: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the concept of molecular (RS&#8208;) chirality is ubiquitous in chemistry, there are further forms of structural chirality, such as the enantiomorphism of crystals that describes the lack of mirror symmetry in the unit cell. This minireview sets a theoretical focus on how chiral crystals can be studied with vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and how computations become reliable.







Abstract
Chirality is a curious phenomenon that appears in various forms. While the concept of molecular (RS&#8208;)chirality is ubiquitous in chemistry, there are also more intricate forms of structural chirality. One of them is the enantiomorphism of crystals, especially molecular crystals, that describes the lack of mirror symmetry in the unit cell. Its relation to molecular chirality is not obvious, but still an open question, which can be addressed with chiroptical tools. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) denotes chiral infrared (IR) spectroscopy that is susceptible to both, the molecular as well as the intermolecular space by means of vibrational transitions. When carried out in the solid state, VCD delivers a very rich set of non&#8208;local contributions that are determined by crystal packing and collective motion. Since its discovery in the 1970s, VCD has become the method of choice for the determination of absolute configurations, but its applicability reaches beyond towards the study of different crystal forms and polymorphism. This brief review summarises the theoretical concepts of crystal chirality and how computations of solid&#8208;state VCD can shed light into the intimate connection of chiral structure and vibrational optical activity.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes with Internal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and internal olefins has been developed, providing a wide range of multisubstituted gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes. This reaction shows an example where the &#8220;CF2&#8221; motif can be kept upon ring extension. The process is atom&#8208;economic and allows to reach numerous gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules represents a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) and internal olefins has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good functional group compatibility, excellent regioselectivity and good diastereoselectivity. The resulting gem&#8208;difluorinated products can undergo downstream transformations to access various mono&#8208;fluorinated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This reaction demonstrates the use of gem&#8208;DFCPs as a type of &#8220;CF2&#8221; C3 synthon for cycloaddition under transition metal catalysis, which provides potential strategy for synthesizing other gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanical Assays
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface immobilization technique for atomic force microscopy/single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy is crucial for experimental yield, accuracy and resolution. Reported herein is that a commonly used lysine&#8208;based immobilization can result in significant signal deterioration, including lowering of rupture forces, effective shortening of linkers, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway polyprotein system.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.

         <title>Copper (I)&#8208;BOX Catalyzed Asymmetric 3&#8208;Component Reaction for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Propargylic Ethers and Anilines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of trifluoromethylated propargylic ethers and amines is described. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity using a simple chiral CuI&#8208;BOX system and tolerates a broad range of alcohol, aniline and alkyne substitution. With chiral alcohols, a high diastereoselectivity is observed, indicating good catalyst stereocontrol.







Abstract
An asymmetric 3&#8208;component reaction between EthynylBenziodoXoles (EBXs), 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane and nucleophiles catalyzed by a CuI&#8208;BOX (Bisoxazoline) catalyst is described. This protocol gives access to chiral trifluoromethylated propargyl ethers and anilines, which are valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity and yield with different nucleophiles such as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, as well as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor anilines. Aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes can be successfully introduced as electrophiles. In case of chiral substrates, high catalyst control was observed, leading to good diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Dimerization of a Reactive Azaacene Diradical: Synthesis of a Covalent Azaacene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of two reactive dicyanomethyl diradicals forms a covalent azaacene cage. In this cascade, four new, elongated &#963;&#8208;CC&#8208;bonds (marked in red) are formed and the internal alkynes transformed into cumulenes. The cage was investigated via several spectroscopy methods at different temperatures, suggesting the reformation of its constituting diradical.







Abstract
Two series of regioisomeric dicyanomethylene substituted dithienodiazatetracenes with formal para&#8208; or ortho&#8208;quinodimethane subunits were synthesized and characterized. Whereas the para&#8208;isomers (p&#8208;n, diradical index y0=0.01) are stable and isolable, the ortho&#8208;isomer (y0=0.98) dimerizes into a covalent azaacene cage. Four elongated &#963;&#8208;CC bonds are formed and the former triisopropylsilyl(TIPS) &#8208;ethynylene groups transformed into cumulene units. The azaacene cage dimer (o&#8208;1)2 was characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis and temperature&#8208;dependent infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, solid&#8208;state), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopies (solution) indicating reformation of o&#8208;1.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution through Retarded Charge Trapping and Recombination by Continuously Distributed Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by its great success in the photovoltaic field, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has recently been actively explored as photocatalysts in H2 evolution reactions. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 photocatalysts remains hampered by the intrinsically fast trapping and recombination of photogenerated charges. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defective areas to promote charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts. By deliberately designing and synthesizing the MAPbI3 photocatalysts featuring a unique continuation of defective areas, we demonstrate that such a feature enables retardation of charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance. As an outcome, such MAPbI3 photocatalysts turn out to achieve an impressive photocatalytic H2 evolution rate as high as 0.64 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, one order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional MAPbI3 photocatalysts. This work establishes a new paradigm for controlling charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Chiral Three&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylamine, EA=Ethylamine) have been constructed by introducing chiral and achiral cations into the 3D &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic framework. The realization of 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provides a new route for developing chiral materials toward spintronics and chiroptoelectronics applications.







Abstract
Chiral three&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylammonium, EA=ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D 1&#8208;R/S shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, 1&#8208;S presents sensitive X&#8208;ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is 14&#8197;times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spintronics and optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;A pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BPEA)EA&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1-R/S&lt;/b&gt;) (R-/S-BPEA=(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-1-4-Bromophenylethylamine, EA=Ethylamine) have been constructed by introducing chiral and achiral cations into the 3D &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic framework. The realization of 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provides a new route for developing chiral materials toward spintronics and chiroptoelectronics applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral three-dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BPEA)EA&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1-R/S&lt;/b&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BPEA=(R/S)-1-4-Bromophenylethylammonium, EA=ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D &lt;b&gt;1-R/S&lt;/b&gt; shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, &lt;b&gt;1-S&lt;/b&gt; presents sensitive X-ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 14&#8197;times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spintronics and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights the inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with different configurations and summarizes their latest progress for heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions. These enable to design efficient DACs with well&#8208;defined structures for boosting catalysis.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique intrinsic properties. The synergy between dual atoms provides flexible active sites, promising to enhance performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual&#8208;atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter&#8208;metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single&#8208;atom, N/O&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom, and direct dual&#8208;metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure&#8208;activity relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.

The 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocycle oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi&#8208;rigid N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o&#8208;TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a CuI cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.







Abstract
A new 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o&#8208;TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;positions in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion by three&#8208;fold SNAr reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture. o&#8208;TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a CuI cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the CuI cation, the non&#8208;emissive o&#8208;TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the CuI cation. The o&#8208;TQ/CuI complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a gem&#8208;difluorinated terminus.

         <title>Modular&#8208;Approach Synthesis of Giant Molecule Acceptors via Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Knoevenagel Condensation for Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective approach to accessing giant molecule acceptors is presented, employing a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation (or its silyl&#8208;mediated version). Notably, this new approach significantly expands the range of substrates that enables the use of readily available diboronated linkers. This methodology also offers a modular and robust synthesis of tailor&#8208;made donor&#8208;acceptors for a wide range of emerging technologies.







Abstract
The operational stability of polymer solar cells is a critical concern with respect to the thermodynamic relaxation of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) or A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A structured small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) within their blends with polymer donors. Giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) bearing SMAs as subunits offer a solution to this issue, while their classical synthesis via the Stille coupling suffers from low reaction efficiency and difficulty in obtaining mono&#8208;brominated SMA, rendering the approach impractical for their large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost preparation. In this study, we present a simple and cost&#8208;effective solution to this challenge through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with boron trifluoride etherate (BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2) as catalyst. We demonstrated that the coupling of the monoaldehyde&#8208;terminated A&#8208;D&#8208;CHO unit and the methylene&#8208;based A&#8208;link&#8208;A (or its silyl enol ether counterpart) substrates can be quantitatively achieved within 30&#8197;minutes in the presence of acetic anhydride, affording a variety of GMAs connected via the flexible and conjugated linkers. The photophysical properties was fully studied, yielding a high device efficiency of over 18&#8201;%. Our findings offer a promising alternative for the modular synthesis of GMAs with high yields, easier work up, and the widespread application of such methodology will undoubtedly accelerate the progress of stable polymer solar cells.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8208;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on P&#8208;doped TiO2 mediate visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia borane hydrolysis. The optimized Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. P doping enhances the visible&#8208;light absorption and modulates the electronic states of the metals to enhance the strong metal&#8208;support interactions, thereby promoting the hydrogen&#8208;evolving activity and stability of the catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8208;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283&#8197;K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8722;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.

Therefore, a visible-light-driven strategy for generating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus-doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni-Pt/P-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was prepared by phytic-acid-assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co-reduction strategy. Under visible-light irradiation at 283&#8197;K, Ni&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/P-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/P-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originated from a combination of the Ni&#8722;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal-semiconductor interface, and strong metal-support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB-hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high-performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal-support interactions for other visible-light-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a hydrogen&#8208;transfer reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. By incorporating a hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride, high yields of aromatic monomers with switchable selectivity are achieved. Choline chloride greatly improves lignin dissolution and tailors the hydrogenolysis of lignin. The proposed strategy promotes the development of targeted lignin valorization and lignin&#8208;first biorefinery.







Abstract
Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1&#8197;bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 97.3&#8201;% using an optimal content of ChCl (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in ethylene glycol at 190&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110&#8197;wt&#8201;%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 87.6&#8201;%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteraborin multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent scaffolds (NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR) based on role&#8208;play with HOMO energy to achieve the extremely narrow FWHM of 14&#8197;nm were proposed and synthesized via lithium free one&#8208;shot double borylation. The organic light emitting diode employing the NO&#8208;DBMR/Cz&#8208;DBMR manifested state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity and external quantum efficiency of 29.8/33.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, hinge on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons based on role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#8197;nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82&#8201;%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, resulting in high reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC) of 105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Hydrogenation of C=O Bonds of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Pentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal copper catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pentanones affording the corresponding chiral exocyclic allylic pentanols in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) is reported. Mechanistic studies indicate that only the C=O bond is chemoselectively reduced and the reaction is promoted via the multiple attractive dispersion interactions between the Cu catalyst and substrate.







Abstract
A highly chemoselective earth&#8208;abundant transition metal copper catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O bonds of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pentanones was realized using H2. The desired products were obtained with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99&#8201;% ee, after recrystallization). The corresponding chiral exocyclic allylic pentanol products can be converted into several bioactive molecules. The hydrogenation mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and control experiments, which indicate that the keto&#8208;enol isomerization rate of the substrate is faster than that of the hydrogenation and also show that the Cu&#8722;H complex can only catalyze chemoselectively the asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group. Computational results indicate that the multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI effect) between the catalyst with bulky substituents and substrate play important roles which stabilize the transition states and reduce the generation of by&#8208;products.

         <title>Non&#8208;activated Esters as Reactive Handles in Direct Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of non&#8208;activated esters represents interesting opportunities in polymer science. While early attempts indicated severe synthetic challenges in this area, recently several researchers have made significant progress, thus enabling structural diversification and synthetic upcycling of various polymers. This review summarizes this progress, and highlights unique structural features that can be exploited in a macromolecular context.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated esters are prominently featured functional groups in polymer science, as ester functional monomers display great structural diversity and excellent compatibility with a wide range of polymerization mechanisms. Yet, their direct use as a reactive handle in post&#8208;polymerization modification has been typically avoided due to their low reactivity, which impairs the quantitative conversion typically desired in post&#8208;polymerization modification reactions. While activated ester approaches are a well&#8208;established alternative, the modification of non&#8208;activated esters remains a synthetic and economically valuable opportunity. In this review, we discuss past and recent efforts in the utilization of non&#8208;activated ester groups as a reactive handle to facilitate transesterification and aminolysis/amidation reactions, and the potential of the developed methodologies in the context of macromolecular engineering.

         <title>Dihydrogen and Ethylene Activation by a Sterically Distorted Distibene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a hindered and highly distorted distibene complex capable of reacting with H2 and ethylene. NMR studies point to a feasible dissociation of the dimeric species into a fleeting stibinidene intermediate, which rapidly engages in reactivity. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity for SbI compounds provides crucial understanding towards the putative Sb redox catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene ([4]2) and its transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H2 and ethylene. Although [4]2 exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that [4]2 remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of [4]2 toward H2 and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of [4]2 into the transient stibinidene ([4]), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis and Concurrent Immobilization of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks on Electrodes Using an Electrogenerated Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology for covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface with high crystallinity and porosity.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous materials with prospective uses in various devices. However, general bulk synthetic methods usually produce COFs as powders that are insoluble in most of the common organic solvents, arising challenges for the subsequent molding and fixing of these materials on substrates. Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a suitable precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from the corresponding amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine&#8208;based COFs, including a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF structure.

         <title>Revealing Active Sites and Reaction Pathways in Methane Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling over Iron&#8208;Containing Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siliceous iron&#8208;containing zeolites were synthesized for methane non&#8208;oxidative coupling. Advanced spectroscopic investigations elucidated the active sites including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores, and revealed the gas&#8208;phase reaction pathways starting from methyl radicals towards (poly)aromatic species.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane is a promising route to obtain ethylene directly from natural gas. We synthesized siliceous [Fe]zeolites with MFI and CHA topologies and found that they display high selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% for MFI and &gt;99&#8201;% for CHA) to ethylene and ethane among gas&#8208;phase products. Deactivated [Fe]zeolites can be regenerated by burning coke in air. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Fe3+ centers in zeolite framework of fresh catalysts are reduced during the reaction to the active sites, including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores. Photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy results show that methyl radicals are the reaction intermediates formed upon methane activation. Ethane is formed by methyl radical coupling, followed by its dehydrogenation to ethylene. Based on the observation of intermediates including allene, vinylacetylene, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, 2&#8208;butyne, and cyclopentadiene over [Fe]MFI, a reaction network is proposed leading to polyaromatic species. Such reaction intermediates are not observed over the small&#8208;pore [Fe]CHA, where ethylene and ethane are the only gas&#8208;phase products.

         <title>Conformational Kinetics in Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: A Dynamic P/M Memory Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination between the conformational control of the pendant group in a chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) with the steric hindrance at the poly(diphenylacetylene) main chain results in the selective memorization of either P or M helical senses in the polymer.







Abstract
Dynamic P/M (plus/minus) helical memory in chiral dissymmetric poly(diphenylacetylene)s (PDPA) is shown using a PDPA that bears the benzamide of (L)&#8208;alanine methyl ester as pendant. For a single chiral polymer, it is possible to obtain either P or M helical structures in a specific solvent without the presence of any chiral external stimuli. To do that, it is necessary to combine the conformational control at the pendant group with a high steric hindrance at the backbone. In this case, by thermal annealing in low&#8208;polar solvents, an anti&#8208;conformer is stabilized at the pendant which commands a P helix in the PDPA. Next, solvent removal followed by addition of a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), results in the kinetic conformationally trapped P helix. However, in this medium, the preferred handedness and the thermodynamic macromolecular helix for poly&#8208;(L)&#8208;1 is M. This process also occurs in the opposite way. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the dynamic memory effect is present both in ground and excited states.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Brushes Grown by Surface&#8208;Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization from Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;based Non&#8208;Covalent Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer brushes are densely grafted, chain end&#8208;tethered assemblies of polymers that can be produced via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. Typically, this is accomplished using initiators or chain transfer agents that are covalently attached to the substrate. This manuscript reports an alternative route towards polymer brushes, which involves the use of non&#8208;covalent cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane host&#8208;guest interactions to surface&#8208;immobilize initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization. These non&#8208;covalent initiators can be used for the surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of a variety of water&#8208;soluble methacrylate monomers to generate supramolecular polymer brushes with film thicknesses of more than 100 nm. The non&#8208;covalent nature of the initiator also allows facile access to patterned polymer brushes, which can be produced in straightforward fashion by drop&#8208;casting a solution of the initiator&#8208;modified guest molecules onto a substrate that presents the cucurbit[7]uril host.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Metal Oxide Interactions in Pd&#8209;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;Catalysts Drive Selective and Stable CO2&#160;Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;catalysts exhibit technological potential for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, but developing scalable systems and comprehending complex dynamic behaviors of the active phase, promoter, and carrier are key for achieving high productivity. Here, we show that the structure of Pd&#8209;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;systems prepared by wet impregnation evolves under CO2&#160;hydrogenation conditions into a selective and stable architecture, independent of the order of addition of Pd and In phases. Detailed&#160;operando&#160;characterization and simulations reveal a rapid restructuring driven by the metal&#8208;metal oxide interaction energetics. The proximity of InPdx&#160;alloy particles decorated by InOx&#160;layers in the resulting architecture prevents performance losses associated with Pd sintering. The findings highlight the crucial role of reaction&#8208;induced restructuring in complex CO2&#160;hydrogenation catalysts and offer insights&#160;into the optimal integration of acid&#8208;base and redox functions&#160;for practical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes: Efficient and Simple Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of bis(NHC) manganese(I) complexes 3 as catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters was investigated. For that purpose, a series of complexes has been synthesized via an improved two step procedure utilizing bis(NHC)&#8208;BEt3 adducts. By applying complexes 3 with KHBEt3 as additive, various aromatic and aliphatic esters were hydrogenated successfully at mild temperatures and low catalyst loadings, highlighting the efficiency of the novel catalytic system. The versatility of the developed catalytic system was further demonstrated by the hydrogenation of other substrate classes like ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner sphere mechanism with the loss of one CO ligand and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel Boron Cooperativity in a PBP&#8208;Ni Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of (tBuPBP)Ni(OAc) (5) by insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8211;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe (1) is presented. An unexpected CO2 cleavage process involving the formation of new B&#8211;O and Ni&#8211;CO bonds leads to the generation of a butterfly&#8208;structured tetra&#8208;nickel cluster (tBuPBOP)2Ni4(m&#8208;CO)2 (6). Mechanistic investigation of this reaction indicates a reductive scission of CO2 by O&#8208;atom transfer to the boron atom via a cooperative nickel&#8208;boron mechanism. The CO2 activation reaction produces a three coordinate (tBuP2BO)Ni&#8208;acyl intermediate (A) that leads to a (tBuP2BO)&#8208;Ni(I) complex (B) via a likely radical pathway. The Ni(I) species is trapped by treatment with the radical trap (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to give (tBuP2BO)Ni(II)(&#951;2&#8208;TEMPO) (7). Additionally, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis using 13C&#8208;enriched CO2 provides information about the species involved in the CO2 activation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the structures and functions of cells to create artificial organelles spurs the development of efficient strategies for producing hollow nanoreactors with biomimetic catalytic functions, but it is still rarely reported because of the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we report the design of hollow nanoreactors with hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles. Starting from molecular&#8208;level design strategy, well&#8208;defined hollow multishelled structure phenolic resins (HoMS&#8208;PR) and carbon (HoMS&#8208;C) submicron particles were accurately architected. HoMS&#8208;C can serve as an excellent, versatile platform, owing to its tunable properties with tailored functional sites, for achieving precise spatial location of metal nanoparticles, internally encapsulated (Pd@HoMS&#8208;C) or externally supported (Pd/HoMS&#8208;C). Impressively, the combination of the delicate nanoarchitecture and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles endow the pair of nanoreactors size&#8208;shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation, including high activity and selectivity of Pd@HoMS&#8208;C for small aliphatic substrates and Pd/HoMS&#8208;C for large aromatic substrates. Theoretic calculation provides insights into the pair of nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in energy barrier of substrate adsorption. This work shed the light on rational design and accurate construction of hollow nanoreactors with precise location of active sites and fine&#8208;modulated microenvironment by mimicking the functions of cells.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed&#160;d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi&#8208;based catalyst derived from a bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework featuring a high O coordination number (Bi&#8208;MOF) for the highly selective O2 reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi coordinated with O and S&#160;atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu). Compared with control samples comprising Bi single atoms or nanoclusters, the catalyst with such a unique structure gives a high selectivity for 2e&#8211; reduction (maximum up to 95%) in RRDE test, and a large current density (36 mA cm&#8211;2 at 0.15 V vs. RHE), a considerable H2O2 yield with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency (11.5 mg cm&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 with FE ~ 90% at 0.3 V vs. RHE) and a long&#8208;term durability (~22 h) in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement &#8216;OR&#8217; logic operations. This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p&#8208;n and n&#8208;p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ Cyanidation Strategy to Access Tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene Diimides with High Electron Mobilities Exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyano&#8208;substituted acene diimides, named as tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs), are synthesized using a facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy. Unlike conventional cyano substitution reactions, our approach enables access to a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone with the in&#8208;situ formation of four cyano substitutes at room temperature while avoiding extra cyano&#8208;functionalization reactions. TCDADIs decorated with different N&#8208;alkyl substituents present good solubility, near&#8208;coplanar backbones, good crystallinity, and low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of &#8722;4.33 eV, all of which contribute to desirable electron&#8208;transport performance when applied to organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET). The highest electron mobility of OFET based on 2&#8208;hexyldecyl&#8208;substituted TCDADIs single crystal reaches 12.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is not only among the highest values for the reported n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials (OSMs) but also exceeds that of most n&#8208;type OSMs decorated with imide units.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by&#160;Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we accomplished a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivities and high regioselectivities. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. In addition, mechanistic studies using DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs via a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Anisotropy in Eutectic Crystals of Polynuclear Lanthanide Complexes and Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropy is an intrinsic property of crystalline materials. However, the photoluminescence anisotropy in eutectic crystals of organometallic complexes has remained unexplored. Herein, the eutectic of polynuclear lanthanide complexes and Ag clusters was prepared, and the crystal shows significant photoluminescence anisotropy. The polarization anisotropy of emission &#948; and degree of excitation polarization P are 2.62 and 0.53, respectively. The rare excitation polarization properties have been proved to be related to the regular arrangement of electric transition dipole moments of luminescent molecules in the crystal. Our design provides a reference for developing new photoluminescence anisotropy materials and expanding their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Electrophiles with Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In terms of its abundance and its minimal toxicity, iron has advantages relative to other transition metals. Although alkyl&#8211;alkyl bond construction is central to organic synthesis, examples of iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl couplings of alkyl electrophiles are relatively sparse. Herein we report an iron catalyst that achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents. Carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation proceeds at room temperature, and the method employs commercially available components (Fe(OAc)2, Xantphos, and Mg(OEt)2); interestingly, this set of reagents can be applied directly to a distinct hydrofunctionalization of olefins, hydroboration. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation (olefin binding to iron and &#946;&#8208;migratory insertion).</dc:description>

         <title>2D MOF&#8208;assisted Pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy Alloy Nanoparticles Library for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have received considerable attention in various applications due to their compositional variability and exceptional properties. However, the complexity of both the general synthesis and structure&#8208;activity relationships remain the long&#8208;standing challenges in this field. Herein, we report a versatile 2D MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying route to successfully synthesize a series of binary, ternary and even high&#8208;entropy NPs that are uniformly dispersed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (PNC NSs). As a proof of utility, the obtained Co0.2Ru0.7Pt0.1/PNC NSs exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity and durability with a record&#8208;high mass specific kinetic current of 1.84 A mg&#8208;1 at the overpotential of 50 mV, which is approximately 11.5 times higher than that of the Pt benchmark. Both experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the addition of Pt engenders a phase transition in CoRu alloys from hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) to face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure. The elevated reactivity of the resulted ternary alloy can be attributed to the optimized ad&#8208;sorption of hydrogen intermediate and the decreased reaction barrier for water formation. This study opens a new avenue for the development of highly efficient alloy NPs with various compositions and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzidine Derivatives: A Class of High Redox Potential Molecules for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of water&#8208;soluble redox&#8208;active molecules with high potentials is one of the effective ways to enhance the energy density of aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). Herein, a series of promising N&#8208;substituted benzidine analogues as water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable redox potentials (0.78 ~1.01 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) were obtained by the molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines. Theoretical calculations reveal that the redox potentials of these benzidine derivatives in acidic solution are determined by their electronic structure and alkalinity. Among these benzidine derivatives, N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;Tetraethylbenzidine (TEB) shows both high redox potential (0.82 V vs. SHE) and good solubility (1.1 M). Pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte, the cell displayed discharge capacity retention of 99.4% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of ~100% over 1200 cycles. The stable discharge capacity of 41.8 Ah L&#8208;1 was achieved at the 1.0 M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2%, demonstrating that N&#8208;substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.</dc:description>

The stable discharge capacity of 41.8 Ah L-1 was achieved at the 1.0 M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2%, demonstrating that N-substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton coupled electron transfer (PCET), slow C&#8208;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8208;O&#8208;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8208;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Migratory Allylation of Remote Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chain walking has been an efficient route to realize the functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds, but this strategy is limited to mono&#8208;olefin migration and functionalization. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of tandem directed simultaneous migrations of remote olefins and stereoselective allylation for the first time. The adoption of palladium hydride catalysis and secondary amine morpholine as solvent is critical for achieving high substrate compatibility and stereochemical control with this method. The protocol is also applicable to the functionalization of three vicinal C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds and thus construct three continuous stereocenters along a propylidene moiety via a short synthetic process. Preliminary mechanistic experiments corroborated the design of simultaneous walking of remote dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Indacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of two or more directly fused antiaromatic subunits are rare due to their high reactivity. However, it is important to understand how the interactions between the antiaromatic subunits influence the electronic properties of the fused structure. Herein, we present the&#160;synthesis of two fused indacene dimer isomers: s&#8208;indaceno[2,1&#8208;a]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (s&#8208;ID) and as&#8208;indaceno[3,2&#8208;b]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene (as&#8208;ID), containing two fused antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or as&#8208;indacene units, respectively. Their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 1H NMR/ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed that both  s&#8208;ID and  as&#8208;ID have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. However, while localized antiaromaticity was observed in  s&#8208;ID,  as&#8208;ID showed weak global aromaticity. Moreover,  as&#8208;ID exhibited a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap than  s&#8208;ID. All the differences can be attributed to their distinct quinoidal substructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cooperative CO2 Adsorption via a Cation Crowding Mechanism on a Cesium&#8208;Exchanged Phillipsite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cooperative CO2 adsorption on a flexible cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite, a channel&#8208;based small&#8208;pore zeolite, is operated by an unprecedented adsorption phenomenon: structural breathing (the narrow&#8208;to&#8208;wide pore) is associated with the crowding and dispersal of large Cs+ ions, depending on the CO2 pressure, termed the &#8216;cation crowding&#8217; mechanism.







Abstract
An understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanisms on small&#8208;pore zeolites is of practical importance in the development of more efficient adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from N2 or CH4. Here we report that the CO2 isotherms at 25&#8211;75&#8201;&#176;C on cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 2.5 (Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5) are characterized by a rectilinear step shape: limited uptake at low CO2 pressure (PCO2) is followed by highly cooperative uptake at a critical pressure, above which adsorption rapidly approaches capacity (2.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). Structural analysis reveals that this isotherm behavior is attributed to the high concentration and large size of Cs+ ions in dehydrated Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5. This results in Cs+ cation crowding and subsequent dispersal at a critical loading of CO2, which allows the PHI framework to relax to its wide pore form and enables its pores to fill with CO2 over a very narrow range of PCO2. Such a highly cooperative phenomenon has not been observed for other zeolites.

         <title>Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization of Novel Octamolybdate Anions within a Microporous Hybrid Framework with Robust Water Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential thermally&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal isomerizations of novel octamolybdate anions occur within a hybrid coordination network formed by the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters and copper(II)&#8208;complexes of a macrocyclic tetraaza ligand. Up to three different microporous phases with accessible voids can be isolated, which exhibit robust water sorption properties.







Abstract
The 3D hybrid framework [{Cu(cyclam)}3(&#954;&#8208;Mo8O27)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (1) (cyclam=1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) undergoes sequential single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations upon heating to afford two different anhydrous phases (2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a). These transitions modify the framework dimensionality and enable the isomerization of &#954;&#8208;octamolybdate (&#954;&#8208;Mo8) anions into &#955; (2&#8201;a) and &#956; (3&#8201;a) forms through metal migration. Hydration of 3&#8201;a involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;&#8208;Mo8 isomer in 4, which dehydrates back into 3&#8201;a through the 6&#8201;a intermediate. In contrast, 2&#8201;a reversibly hydrates to form 5, exhibiting the same Mo8 cluster as that of 1. It is remarkable that three of the Mo8 clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from 1 (2&#8201;a, 3&#8201;a, and 6&#8201;a). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM&#8208;based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.

         <title>Unraveling the Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active&#8208;Learning&#8208;Potential Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active&#8208;learning&#8208;potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition&#8208;metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.







Abstract
MXenes are 2D materials with great potential in various applications. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but low cost. The oxidation behaviors of super large aqueous MXene systems are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. Free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponentially decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation of super&#8208;sized aqueous MXene systems. It opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes.

         <title>Polyketide Synthase&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Methyloxime Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Oximidine Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anticancer agent oximidine I and three novel variants were discovered as products of a cryptic trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS in Pseudomonas baetica. By manipulating the biosynthetic pathway, a key intermediate was identified that retains potent anticancer properties. A combination of bioinformatics analysis and genetic and biochemical experiments illuminated the oximidine biosynthetic pathway, including a novel mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation.







Abstract
Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are modular megaenzymes that employ unusual catalytic domains to assemble diverse bioactive natural products. One such PKS is responsible for the biosynthesis of the oximidine anticancer agents, oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides that inhibit vacuolar H+&#8208;ATPases. Here, we describe the identification of the oximidine gene cluster in Pseudomonas baetica and the characterization of four novel oximidine variants, including a structurally simpler intermediate that retains potent anticancer activity. Using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and computational approaches, we experimentally elucidate the oximidine biosynthetic pathway and reveal an unprecedented mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation. We show that this process involves a specialized monooxygenase and methyltransferase domain and provide insight into their activity, mechanism and specificity. Our findings expand the catalytic capabilities of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and identify potential strategies for the production of novel oximidine analogues.

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#956;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) are inactivated by dioxygen. High&#8208;resolution crystallography was used to show how O2 induces a stepwise rearrangement of the Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster in the active site, with evidence for a reversible and an irreversible phase of cluster destruction. The open coordination site on Ni renders the cluster vulnerable, and its protection offers strategies to prevent inactivation.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#956;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Thermal Stability and Outgassing Behaviors of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal stability and outgassing as two critical safety metrics of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are summarized from a chemical perspective. Thermal decomposition of high&#8208;Ni cathodes starts with ion migration, phase transition, and oxygen release, and ends up with electrolyte combustion. Gas evolution originates from the chemical decomposition of surface lithium carbonate residues and electrolytes under the attack of oxygen from the cathode.







Abstract
LiNiO2&#8208;based high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density automotive lithium batteries. Most of the attention thus far has been paid towards addressing their surface and structural instability issues brought by the increase of Ni content (&gt;90&#8201;%) with an aim to enhance the cycle stability. However, the poor safety performance remains an intractable problem for their commercialization in the market, yet it has not received appropriate attention. In this review, we focus on the gas generation and thermal degradation behaviors of high&#8208;Ni cathodes, which are critical factors in determining their overall safety performance. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of outgassing and thermal runaway reactions is presented and analyzed from a chemistry perspective. Finally, we discuss the challenges and the insights into developing robust, safe high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), were developed for precision cancer immunotherapy with minimized side effects.







Abstract
The efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of the STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance the anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of a Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinspired design strategy, a CO2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a, is fabricated, which possesses unprecedented [Mn86] nanocage&#8208;based structure and high structure robustness. Attributed to the unique enzyme&#8208;like CO2&#8208;binding pockets, NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a can selectively remove CO2 from CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures with high selectivities.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unicorn double perovskite iodides [A2MIMIIII6] are elusive, but with the help of rational design rules, can indeed be synthesized. The Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy) family demonstrate optical properties that are red shifted compared to related halide materials and their magnetic properties show weak interaction parameters.







Abstract
Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was used to study the local chemical properties of bilayer synthetic two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) with atomic&#8208;scale spatial resolution. TERS established the chemical fingerprint of bilayer borophene that is correlated with the vibration of interlayer B&#8722;B bonds and revealed its chemical stability with single&#8208;bond (B&#8722;O) sensitivity by exposure to controlled oxidizing conditions in ultrahigh vacuum.







Abstract
Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8211;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, C&#8211;Si, and C&#8211;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.</dc:description>

         <title>Compartmentalized Polyampholyte Microgels by Depletion Flocculation and Coacervation of Nanogels in Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8208;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8208;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8208;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the Persistent Radical Effect in the Synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple method for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans is reported. This approach leverages the equilibrium between quinone methide dimers and their persistent radicals. This equilibrium is disrupted by phenols that yield comparatively transient phenoxyl radicals, leading to cross&#8208;coupling between the persistent and transient radicals. The resultant quinone methides with pendant phenols rapidly cyclize to form dihydrobenzofurans (DHBs). This putative biomimetic access to dihydrobenzofurans provides superb functional group tolerance and a unified approach for the synthesis of resveratrol&#8208;based natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time pH&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of Ionisable Lipids from COVID&#8208;19 Vaccines and In Situ Nucleic Acid Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionisable amino&#8208;lipid is a key component in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which plays a crucial role in the encapsulation of RNA molecules, allowing efficient cellular uptake and then releasing RNA from acidic endosomes. Herein, we present direct evidence for the remarkable structural transitions, with decreasing membrane curvature, including from inverse micellar, to inverse hexagonal, to two distinct inverse bicontinuous cubic, and finally to a lamellar phase for the two mainstream COVID&#8208;19 vaccine ionisable ALC&#8208;0315 and SM&#8208;102 lipids, occurring upon gradual acidification as encountered in endosomes. The millisecond kinetic growth of the inverse cubic and hexagonal structures and the evolution of the ordered structure formation upon ionisable&#8208;lipid&#8208;RNA/DNA complexation are quantitatively revealed by in&#8208;situ synchrotron radiation time&#8208;resolved small angle X&#8208;ray scattering coupled with rapid flow mixing. We found that the final self&#8208;assembled structural identity, and the formation kinetics, were controlled by the ionisable lipid molecular structure, acidic bulk environment, lipid compositions, and nucleic acid molecular structure/size. The implicated link between the inverse membrane curvature of LNP and LNP endosomal escape helps future optimisation of ionisable lipids and LNP engineering for RNA and gene delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Consequently, the quest for novel peptide stapling methodologies that would easily incorporate such motifs, remains eminent. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan's indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling was limited compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an unprecedented approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction (TMPR). This method represents a versatile tool for the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides, applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the utilisation of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan represents a significant advancement in the field of peptide stapling, facilitating the formation of stapled peptides in one straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing formation of undesired by&#8208;products &#8211; a persistent challenge in current methodologies. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late&#8208;stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Li Plating Regulation on Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anodes by a Triglyme&#8208;LiNO3 Synergistic Electrolyte Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite anodes are prone to dangerous Li plating during fast charging, but the difficulty to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step has made a challenging to eliminate Li plating thoroughly. Thus, the inherent thinking on inhibiting Li plating needs to be compromised. Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li&#8208;ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)&#8208;LiNO3 synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite&#8208;free and highly&#8208;reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross&#8208;linked oligomeric ether and Li3N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6% Li plating reversibility over 100 cycles. In addition, the 1.2&#8208;Ah LiFePO4 | graphite pouch cell with GLN&#8208;added electrolyte stably operated over 150 cycles at 3 C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries for fast&#8208;charging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Adamantoid Scaffolds for Multiple Cargo Loading and Cellular Delivery as &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is huge demand for developing guests&#160;that bind&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#160;and&#160;can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest.&#160;1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1:1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#160;M&#8208;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1:1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases,&#160;trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#160;and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside.&#160;We established biocompatibility using representative candidate&#160;G4&#160;and its inclusion complex with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells.&#160;We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated&#160;G4&#160;and&#160;established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.&#160;For functional assay, we&#160;incubated HeLa cells with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes&#160;of&#160;G4&#8208;derived prodrugs&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7&#160;displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin.&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7&#160;showed higher cytotoxicity than&#160;G7, camptothecin,&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.</dc:description>

In all cases,&#160;trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of&#160;&#946;-CD&#160;and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside.&#160;We established biocompatibility using representative candidate&#160;G4&#160;and its inclusion complex with&#160;&#946;-CD (&#946;-CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells.&#160;We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine-conjugated&#160;G4&#160;and&#160;established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.&#160;For functional assay, we&#160;incubated HeLa cells with&#160;&#946;-CD-inclusion complexes&#160;of&#160;G4-derived prodrugs&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)-(+)-camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with&#160;&#946;-CD&#8834;G7&#160;displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin.&#160;&#946;-CD&#8834;G7&#160;showed higher cytotoxicity than&#160;G7, camptothecin,&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;&#946;-CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high-density loading and cargo delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Birefringence Activated by Tetrahedra Decorated with Single Linear Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performance enhancement induced by structural modification has long been the target in materials science fields. Direct evidence to witness the effectivity of one strategy is challenging and necessary. In this work, a tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve the birefringent performance sharply, namely decorating the tetrahedra with single linear [S2] unit. The strategy was verified by comprehensive characterization of two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5, which crystallize in the same space group, have similar unit cells and the same units arrangements. Theoretical characterization verified that the [GeS5] group has much larger polarization anisotropy than [GeS4], further demonstrated that the linear [S2] lead to the sharp birefringence enlargement of K2BaGeS5 (0.19 vs 0.03 of K2BaGeS4). This work provides a new guiding thought to improve the birefringence performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Catalyst Loading Enhances Charge Accumulation for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar water oxidation is a critical step in artificial photosynthesis.&#160;&#160;Successful completion of the process requires four holes and releases four protons.&#160;&#160;It depends on the consecutive accumulation of charges at the active site.&#160;&#160;While recent research has shown an obvious dependence of the reaction kinetics on the hole concentrations on the surface of heterogeneous (photo)electrodes, little is known about how the catalyst density impacts the reaction rate.&#160;&#160;Using atomically dispersed Ir catalysts on hematite, we report a study on how the interplay between the catalyst density and the surface hole concentration influences the reaction kinetics.&#160;&#160;At low photon flux, where surface hole concentrations are low, faster charge transfer was observed on photoelectrodes with low catalyst density comparing to high catalyst&#160;&#160;density; at high photon flux and high applied potentials, where surface hole concentrations are moderate or high, slower surface charge recombination was afforded by low density catalysts.&#160;&#160;The results support that charge transfer between the light absorber and the catalyst is reversible; they reveal the unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions.&#160;&#160;It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for optimized performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolinyl Nucleotides Drive Enzyme&#8208;Free Genetic Copying of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is found in all kingdoms of life. It also has remarkable activity as organocatalyst, and it is of structural importance for many folded polypeptides. Here we show that prolinyl nucleotides with a phosphoramidate linkage are active building blocks in enzyme&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;free copying of RNA in the presence of monosubstituted imidazoles as organocatalysts. Both dinucleotides and mononucleotides are incorporated at the terminus of RNA primers in aqueous buffer, as instructed by the template sequence, in up to eight consecutive extension steps. Our results show that condensation products of amino acids and ribonucleotides can act like nucleoside triphosphates in media devoid of enzymes or ribozymes. They are metastable building blocks, readily activated by catalysts, helping to explain why the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and nucleic acids was selected in molecular evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Molybdenum Complexes Bearing PNP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligand toward Ammonia Formation</title>

         <title>Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with Precursor Coisolation Improves Proteome Coverage and Measurement Throughput for Label&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We combined efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography with a newly developed data acquisition and analysis scheme termed wide window acquisition (WWA) to quantify &gt;3,000 proteins from single cells in rapid label&#8208;free analyses. WWA employs large isolation windows to intentionally co&#8208;isolate and co&#8208;fragment adjacent precursors along with the selected precursor. Optimized WWA increases proteome coverage by ~40% relative to standard approaches. For a 40&#8208;min LC gradient operated at ~15 nL/min, we identified an average of 3,524 proteins per single&#8208;cell&#8208;sized aliquot of protein digest. Reducing the active gradient to 20 min resulted in a modest 10% decrease in proteome coverage. Using this platform, we compared protein expression between single HeLa cells having an essential autophagy gene,&#160;atg9a,&#160;knocked out, with their isogenic WT parental line. Similar proteome coverage was observed, and 268 proteins were significantly up&#8208; or downregulated. &#160;Protein upregulation primarily related to innate immunity, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Engineering of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages via a Nanodrug&#8208;Delivering&#8208;Drug (&#946;&#8208;Elemene@Stanene)&#160;Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment, yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immune&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and &#946;&#8208;Elemene are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to booster anti&#8208;tumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intra&#8208;tumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust anti&#8208;tumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment, yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immune-oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug-delivering-drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two-dimensional (2D) stanene-based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;-Elemene (ELE), a small-molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo-immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and &#946;-Elemene are capable of polarizing the tumor-supportive M2-like TAMs into tumor-suppressive M1-like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to booster anti-tumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intra-tumoral ratio of M1/M2-like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust anti-tumor response.
