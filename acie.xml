         <title>Monitoring the Reversibility of GPCR Signaling by Combining Photochromic Ligands with Label&#8208;free Impedance Analysis.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled cell surface receptors (GPCR) trigger complex intracellular signaling cascades upon agonist binding. Classic pharmacological assays provide information about binding affinities, activation or blockade at different stages of the signaling cascade, but real time dynamics and reversibility of these processes remain often disguised. We show that combining photochromic NPY receptor ligands, which can be toggled in their receptor activation ability by irradiation with light of different wavelengths, with whole cell label&#8208;free impedance assays allows observing the cell response to receptor activation and its reversibility over time. The concept demonstrated on NPY receptors may be well applicable to many other GPCRs providing a deeper insight into the time course of intracellular signaling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Enhanced O&#8208;H Cleavage in Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the vital role of spin polarization in proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated water oxidation over a magnetized catalyst. During the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, the external magnetic field induced a remarkable increase in the OER current, however, this increment achieved in weakly alkaline pH (pH 9) was almost 20 times that under strongly alkaline conditions (pH 14). The results of the surface modification experiment and H/D kinetic isotope effect investigation confirm that, at weakly alkaline pH, during the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates. The spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8208;H cleavage and triplet O&#8208;O bonding occur synergistically, which promotes the O2 generation more significantly than the strongly alkaline case involving only spin&#8208;enhanced O&#8208;O bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipophilicity modulations by fluorination correlate with membrane partitioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive compounds generally need to cross membranes to arrive at their site of action. The octanol&#8208;water partition coefficient (lipophilicity, logPOW) has proven to be an excellent proxy for membrane permeability. In modern drug discovery, logPOW and bioactivity are optimized simultaneously, for which fluorination is one of the relevant strategies. The question arises to which extent the often subtle logP modifications resulting from different aliphatic fluorine&#8208;motif introductions also lead to concomitant membrane permeability changes, given the difference in molecular environment between octanol and (anisotropic) membranes. We find that for a given compound class, there is excellent correlation between logPOW values with the corresponding membrane molar partitioning coefficients (Kp); a study enabled by novel solid state 19F NMR MAS methodology using lipid vesicles. Our results show that the factors that cause modulation of octanol&#8208;water partition coefficients similarly affect membrane permeability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Tip Sensor with a New Functional Nucleic Acid Probe for Food&#8208;borne Pathogen Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor is developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), using a new synthetic nucleic acid probe (NAP) as a linker for the immobilization of a DNA&#8208;conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) onto a DNA&#8208;attached thin Au layer inside a pipette tip. In the presence of Salmonella, RNase H2 from Salmonella (STH2) cleaves the NAP and the freed DNA&#8208;conjugated AuNP can be visually detected by a paper strip. This portable biosensor does not require any electronic, electrochemical or optical equipment. It delivers a detection limit of 3.2 &#215; 103 CFU/mL for Salmonella in 1 h without cell&#8208;culturing or signal amplification and does not show cross&#8208;reactivity with several control bacteria. Further, the sensor reliably detects Salmonella spiked in food samples, such as ground beef and chicken, milk, and eggs. The sensor can be reused and is stable at ambient temperature, showing its potential as a point&#8208;of&#8208;need device for the prevention of food poisoning by Salmonella.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytically Activating and Reducing N2&#160;Molecule by Tuning Activity of Local Hydrogen Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N2 on X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual&#8208;atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N2 adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts for N2 activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8208;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8208;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8208;H bond for N2 hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual&#8208;atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N2 reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture.

         <title>A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazoles and azides find broad application in pharmaceuticals, chemical biology, and high&#8208;energy materials. In this work multivariant linear regression and classification are leveraged to develop predictive statistical models for their decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity, which are key in evaluating the safety of a given molecule. Furthermore, interpretation of the statistical models provided rich insight into the decomposition mechanisms.







Abstract
Nitrogen atom&#8208;rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data&#8208;driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact&#8208;initiated decomposition.

         <title>Hierarchical Microtubular Covalent Organic Frameworks Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically microtubular covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were achieved by a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation process, where the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units were decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units. The mixed COFs with hierarchical architectures exhibited much&#8208;improved efficiency and selectivity in catalyzing CO2 reduction with phenylsilane and N&#8208;methylaniline due to enhanced mass transport ability.







Abstract
Pore environment and aggregated structure play a vital role in determining the properties of porous materials, especially regarding the mass transfer. Reticular chemistry imparts covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;aligned micro/mesopores, yet constructing hierarchical architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation methodology to prepare microtubular COFs. In this process, the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units, leading to the crystal transformation of COFs. Moreover, the aggregated structure and conversion degree varied with the reaction time, where the hollow tubular aggregates composed of mixed COF crystals could be obtained. Such hierarchical architecture leads to enhanced mass transfer properties, as proved by the adsorption measurement and chemical catalytic reactions. This self&#8208;template strategy was successfully applied to another four COFs with different building units.

         <title>Breaking the Size Limitation of Directly&#8208;Synthesized PbS Quantum Dot Inks Toward Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) PbS quantum dot (QD) inks is realized after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, SWIR solar cells and photodetector devices are fabricated, demonstrating record&#8208;high efficiency. The direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.







Abstract
PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) devices. The recently developed direct synthesis of semi&#8208;conductive PbS QD inks has substantially simplified the preparation processing and reduced the material cost, while facing the challenge to synthesize large&#8208;size QDs with absorption covering the SWIR region. Herein, we for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of SWIR PbS QD inks after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44&#8201;% through an 1100&#8197;nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70&#8201;% at &#8776;1300&#8197;nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Diamines via Reductive Coupling of Ketimines Templated by Chiral Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines are prepared with high ee values and good to excellent yields via an unprecedented chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines. The synthetic value of these chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the development of efficient organocatalysts for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes.







Abstract
We herein describe the chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines, providing for the first time a series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines with excellent ee values and good to high yields. The powerful and efficient diboron&#8208;participated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is successfully demonstrated by the homocoupling of a variety of ketimines thanks to the rational design and engineering of chiral diborons. Systematic DFT studies suggest that two chiral diborons adopt different conformational assembling strategies to couple the diboron template with ketimine substrates in their tight concerted transition states to ensure the excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes by employing a chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamine&#8208;based organocatalyst.

         <title>Heterocyclic Chromophore Amphiphiles and their Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles have been introduced into the structure of the model perylene monoimide chromophore amphiphile to afford monomers that undergo supramolecular polymerization in water but have different conductivities. The heterocycles alter the monomeric molecular dipole moments, which impacts the internal order within the polymeric assemblies. The conductivity of the supramolecular polymers formed are seemingly dependent on short&#8208;range interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amphiphiles in water is an attractive approach to create functional nanostructures. Here, we report on the synthesis, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, aqueous supramolecular polymerization, and conductivity of polycyclic aromatic dicarboximide amphiphiles. The chemical structure of the model perylene monoimide amphiphile was modified with heterocycles, essentially substituting one fused benzene ring with thiophene, pyridine or pyrrole rings. All the heterocycle&#8208;containing monomers investigated underwent supramolecular polymerization in water. Large changes to the monomeric molecular dipole moments led to nanostructures with low electrical conductivity due to diminished interactions. Although the substitution of benzene with thiophene did not notably change the monomer dipole moment, it led to crystalline nanoribbons with 20&#8208;fold higher electrical conductivity, due to enhanced dispersion interactions as a result of the presence of sulfur atoms.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising alternative to the energetically intensive anthraquinone process. However, there remain challenges in designing 2e&#8208; ORR catalysts that meet the application criteria. Here, we successfully adopt a microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal approach to synthesize hexagonal phase SnO2 (h&#8208;SnO2) nanoribbons with largely exposed edge structures. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts achieve the excellent H2O2 selectivity of 99.99%. Moreover, when employing as the catalyst in flow cell device, they exhibit a high yield of 3885.26 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the special crystal structure and morphology, resulting in abundantly exposed edge active sites to convert O2 to H2O2 as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365 nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275 nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42% and 19.02% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18:BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT:PSS devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Mobile Molecules: Reactivity Profiling Guides Faster Movement on a Cysteine Track</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We previously reported a molecular hopper, which makes sub&#8208;nanometer steps by thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange along a track with cysteine footholds within a protein nanopore. Here we optimize the hopping rate (~0.1 s&#8208;1 in the previous work) with a view towards rapid enzymeless biopolymer characterization during translocation within nanopores. We first took a single&#8208;molecule approach to obtain the reactivity profiles of individual footholds. The pKa values of cysteine thiols within a pore ranged from 9.17 to 9.85, and the pH&#8208;independent rate constants of the thiolates with a small&#8208;molecule disulfide varied by up to 20&#8208;fold. Through site&#8208;specific mutagenesis and a pH increase from 8.5 to 9.5, the overall hopping rate of a DNA cargo along a five&#8208;cysteine track was accelerated 4&#8208;fold, and the rate&#8208;limiting step by 21&#8208;fold.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8226;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphibian&#8208;like Flexible Organic Crystal Optical Fibers for Underwater/Air Micro&#8208;Precision Lighting and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic optical waveguides are good candidates for air/underwater dual&#8208;media compatible optical signal transduction. The passive signal transportation in an organic flexible waveguide was effectively channelized for high&#8208;precision nano/micro particle sensing in ambient/aquatic conditions.







Abstract
Visible light guiding optical fibers with underwater operational capability are highly desired for subaquatic communication and sensing technologies. Herein, we present mechanically flexible, blue&#8208;violet fluorescent (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)biphenyl) (BPP) crystal waveguides with high&#8208;aspect ratio. These milli&#8208;meter&#8208;long BPP crystals guide light actively and passively in ambient and underwater conditions demonstrating their amphibian&#8208;like character. Due to the crystal's high flexibility, the optical fiber's output light direction in submerged and ambient states can be altered mechanically for high&#8208;precision lighting and sensing applications. The development of such multi&#8208;environment&#8208;compatible and mechanically flexible organic optical fibers acting as sensing materials possess enormous potential for short&#8208;range underwater photonic technologies.

         <title>Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand&#8208;Based Host&#8722;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, suffering from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross&#8208;links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat&#8208;guest recognition motifs as cross&#8208;links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross&#8208;links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control&#8208;1 cross&#8208;linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (Tensile strength: 21.1&#177; 0.5&#160;vs 2.8 &#177; 0.1 MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177; 4.8&#160;vs 2.1 &#177; 0.3 MPa; Toughness: 90.4&#177; 2.0&#160;vs 10.8 &#177; 0.6 MJ/m3). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high&#8208;performance intelligent supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy &#8210; Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a molecular system, size and shape are of elementary importance for its function and properties. Therefore, the determination of distances within a molecule is essential. However, the commonly used methods are only suitable for distances smaller than 4 &#197; or larger than 15 &#197;. Here, we show that by incorporating a molecular spring, we can measure distances in macrocycles in the range of 10 &#197; using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The accuracy of the method also allows to determine the temperature dependence of the distances. In one case, we find a contraction of the length by almost 10% upon heating. This shrinking due to heating can be considered as inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level and is a previously completely overlooked phenomenon that can be used in the future as a tool to change the length and, thus, the function of a system.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Structural Transformation of a 4&#8208;Ravel Containing Four Crossings and Featuring Cp*Rh/Ir Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intricately interwoven topologies have been continually synthesized and are ultimately equally versatile and significant at the nanoscale level; however, reports concerning ravel structures, which are highly entwined new topological species, are extremely rare and fraught with tremendous synthesis challenges. To solve the synthesis problem, a tetrapodontic pyridine ligand L1 with two types of olefinic bond units and two Cp*M&#8208;based building blocks (E1, M=Rh; E2, M=Ir) featuring large conjugated planes was prepared to perform the self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were obtained by parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions in a single&#8208;step strategy. Remarkably, reversible structural transformations between 4&#8208;ravel and the corresponding metallocage could be realized by concentration changes and solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced effects. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy provide full confirmation of these phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronously Manipulating Absorption and Extinction Coefficient of Semiconducting Polymers via Precise Dual&#8208;Acceptor Engineering for NIR&#8208;II Excited Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating all of the ultralong excitation wavelength, high extinction coefficient, and prominent photothermal conversion ability into a single photothermal agent is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, a precise dual&#8208;acceptor engineering strategy is exploited for this attempt based on donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type semiconductor polymers by subtly regulating the molar proportions of the two employed electron acceptor moieties featured with different electronic affinity and &#960;&#8208;conjugation degrees, and taking full use of the active intramolecular motion&#8208;induced photothermal effect. The optimal polymer SP4, synchronously shows desirable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) absorption, extremely high extinction coefficient, and satisfactory photothermal conversion behavior. Consequently, the unprecedented performance of SP4 NPs on 1064 nm laser&#8208;excited photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination outcomes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a ligand&#8208;controlled Co(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling hydroalkylation for direct and &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals.

         <title>Optochemical control of mRNA translation in eukaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major stage in the expression of genes is the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and the regulation of this process is essential for protein production in cells. How tightly controlled gene expression can be spatially and temporally, is particularly evident in polar cells and embryonic development. We need tools to dissect these complex processes, if we wish to understand the underlying links, especially the difficulties brought on by malfunction. External bioorthogonal triggers are very helpful in this area, if they let us precisely control where and when a process is started. Equipping nucleic acids with light&#8208;responsive groups has proven to be an effective approach to examine the dynamic regulatory route of mRNA translation in living cells. In this review, we present an overview of the most recent methods for optochemically controlling translation, focusing on cis&#8208;acting technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode could exhibit high capacity and power density. However, stable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8 V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded on CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improve the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6 V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2% capacity retention after 400 cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8 V cut&#8208;off voltage.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric C1 Extension of Aldehydes through Biocatalytic Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Mandelic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral building blocks from simple, renewable carbon units has been a long&#8208;term goal of the sustainable chemical industry. Mandelate derivatives are valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and chiral resolving agents, but their manufacture relies heavily on highly toxic cyanide. Herein, we report (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS)&#8208;centered biocatalytic cascades for the synthesis of mandelates from benzaldehydes and glycine. We show that HmaS can be engineered to perform (R)&#8208;selective hydroxylation by single&#8208;point mutation, empowering the stereo&#8208;divergent synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;mandelate derivatives. We demonstrated that these biocatalytic cascades enabled the production of various mandelate derivatives with great atom economy, excellent yields (up to 98%) and enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99%). This methodology offers an effective cyanide&#8208;free technology for greener and sustainable production of mandelate derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>An Optochemical Oxygen Scavenger Enabling Spatiotemporal Control of Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an optochemical O2 scavenging system that enables precise spatiotemporal control of the level of hypoxia in living cells simply by adjusting the light intensity in the illuminated region. The system employs rhodamine containing a selenium or tellurium atom as an optochemical oxygen scavenger that rapidly consumes O2 by photochemical reaction with glutathione as a coreductant upon visible light irradiation (560&#8211;590 nm) and has a rapid response time, within a few minutes. The glutathione&#8208;consuming quantum yields of the system were calculated as about 5%. The spatiotemporal O2 consuming in cultured cells was visualized with a hypoxia&#8208;responsive fluorescence probe, MAR. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was applied to confirmed that different light intensities could generate different levels of hypoxia. To illustrate the potential utility of this system for hypoxia research, we show that it can spatiotemporally control calcium ion (Ca2+) influx into HEK293T cells expressing the hypoxia&#8208;responsive Ca2+ channel TRPA1.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Diverse Tetramic Acid Bearing cis&#8208;Decalin Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report the first total syntheses of four natural antibiotics vermisporin (1), PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A (2), AB4015&#8208;L (3), AB4015&#8208;B (4) and one hydrogenated natural product derivative AB4015&#8208;A2 (5) that all feature a tetramic acid bearing cis&#8208;decalin ring. The construction of the functionalized cis&#8208;decalin ring was achieved by a diastereoselective intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction which underwent a rare endo&#8208;boat transition state. Through an intramolecular neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;oriented strategy, the sterically hindered epoxy group in vermisporin (1), PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A (2) and AB4015&#8208;L (3) was installed efficiently. A one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann&#8208;condensation cascade using L&#8208;amino acid derivatives afforded the desired tetramic acid structure. The total synthesis led to the unambiguous verification of the absolute configuration of these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific functionalization of natural amino acid&#8208;containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. GCE allows for rapid and efficient introduction of bioorthogonal reactive site (i.e., azide) to the pore rim, and conjugation of single stranded DNA or lysozyme was demonstrated. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further used for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides, demonstrating a sensing capacity that a bare MspA nanopore does not possess. GCE with bioorthogonal handles, which has never been previously applied in the preparation of nanopores, is a versatile strategy for pore engineering and may further expand the application scenarios of nanopores.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes &#8211;previously considered to be inaccessible &#8211; was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cationic Biphen[4, 5]arenes as Biofilm Disruptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Since bacteria in biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics and biofilm&#8208;associated infections pose serious threat to global public health, new therapeutic agents and schemes are urgently needed to meet clinical requirements. Here two quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized biphen[n]arenes (WBPn, n = 4, 5) were designed and synthesized with excellent anti&#8208;biofilm potency. Not only could they inhibit assembly of biofilm, but also eradicate intractable mature biofilm formed by Gram&#8208;positive S. aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli bacterial strains. Moreover, they could strongly complex a conventional antibiotic, cefazolin sodium (CFZ) with complex stability constants of (7.41 &#177; 0.29) &#215; 104 M&#8208;1 for CFZ/WBP4 and (4.98 &#177; 0.49) &#215; 103 M&#8208;1 for CFZ/WBP5. Combination of CFZ by WBP4 and WBP5 synergistically enhanced biofilm eradication performance in vitro and statistically improved healing efficacy on E. coli&#8208;infected mice models, providing novel supramolecular strategy for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides represent an important class of carbohydrates that are present in many bioactive molecules. However, due to the lack of substituents at the C&#8208;2 position, the stereoselective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is highly challenging. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8208;alkyl glycosylation reaction to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides from readily available glycals and alkyl halides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides is achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydrometallation of the glycal with the bisoxazoline&#8208;ligated Co&#8208;H species may be the turnover&#8208;limiting and stereo&#8208;determining step of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Triplet Excited States of Organic Semiconductors via Tuning Molecular Conformation for Dual&#8208;ratiometric Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometry is one of highly accurate methods for microscopic thermal measurement in biological systems. Herein, a series of chromone derivatives with noncovalently intramolecular interactions (NIIs) were designed and synthesized for ratiometric thermometers. The triplet states of these organic compounds were systematically tuned upon regulating the conformation with NIIs to yield efficient room temperature phosphorescence and large wavelength difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence simultaneously. As a result, an unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on the intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of fluorescence/phosphorescence vs temperature, which was used for in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy. This work provides a novel method to achieve organic dual ratiometric thermometers via tuning the triplet excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Morphological Transformations of Covalent Organic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) are porous one&#8208;dimensional frameworks connected through imine bonds via Schiff base condensation between aldehydes and amines. The presence of two amine groups at the ortho position in the structurally demanding tetraaminotriptycene (TAT) building block leads to multiple reaction pathways between the ditopic aldehyde and the tetratopic amine. We have synthesized five different monomers of CONT&#8208;1 by the Schiff base condensation reaction between TAT and o&#8208;anisaldehyde. The conversion of imine to imidazole bonding in a monomer is probed using NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Solid&#8208;state NMR&#160;provide insights into the CONTs&#8217; structural connectivity. A theoretical investigation suggests that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking could be the driving force for rapid imine to imidazole conversion within the CONT&#8208;1. Microscopic imaging sheds further light on the self&#8208;assembly process of the CONTs, indicating both head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypsochromically&#8208;shifted Emission of Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Generated through Post&#8208;synthetic Ligand Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials with tunable emission are becoming increasingly desirable as we move towards needing efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for displays. Key to developing better displays is the advancement of strategies for rationally designing emissive materials that are tunable and efficient. We report a series of emissive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) generated using BUT&#8208;10 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) that emits green light with&#160;&#955;max&#160;at 525 nm. Post&#8208;synthetic reduction of the ketone on the fluorenone ligand in BUT&#8208;10 generates new materials, BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M and BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R. The emission for BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R is hypsochromically&#8208;shifted by 113 nm. Multivariate&#160;BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M structures demonstrate emission with two maxima corresponding to the emission of both fluorenol and fluorenone moieties present in their structures.&#160;Our study represents a novel post&#8208;synthetic ligand reduction strategy for producing emissive MOFs with tunable emission ranging from green, white&#8208;blue to deep blue.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversibly Modulating Plasmon&#8208;mediated Chemical Reaction via Electrode Potential on Reliable Copper Nanoelectrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic metal nanostructures are essential for plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Plasmonic nanostructures are commonly made from the coinage metals gold and silver. Copper (Cu) is less used mainly due to the difficulties in fabricating stable nanostructures. However, Cu is an attractive option with its strong plasmonic properties, high catalytic activities, and relatively cheap price. Herein, we fabricated tunable, reliable, and efficient Cu nanoelectrodes (CuNEs). Using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS, we have comprehensively studied the reversible chemical transformations between aromatic amine and nitro groups modified on the CuNE surface. Their PMCRs are well&#8208;controlled by changing the surface roughness, the oxidation states of Cu, and the applied electrode potential. We thus demonstrate a Cu nanostructure enabling better investigations in the interplays between PMCR, electrochemistry, and Cu catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexenes through Photocatalyzed Cascade Cyclization of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monofluoroalkenes are nonhydrolyzable mimetics of amides. Previous work focused on the synthesis of non&#8208;cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non&#8208;cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (&gt; 30 examples, up to 86% yield, &gt; 20:1 dr). The post&#8208;reaction transformations of the products demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Pure Isotropic Proton Solid State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One key bottleneck of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is that 1H NMR spectra of organic solids are often very broad due to the presence of a strong network of dipolar couplings. We have recently suggested a new approach to tackle this problem. More specifically, we parametrically mapped errors leading to residual dipolar broadening into a second dimension and removed them in a correlation experiment. In this way pure isotropic proton (PIP) spectra were obtained that contain only isotropic shifts and provide the highest 1H NMR resolution available today in rigid solids. Here, using a deep&#8208;learning method, we extend the PIP approach to a second dimension, and for samples of L&#8208;tyrosine hydrochloride and ampicillin we obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H double&#8208;quantum/single&#8208;quantum dipolar correlation and spin&#8208;diffusion spectra with significantly higher resolution than the corresponding spectra at 100 kHz MAS, allowing the identification of previously overlapped isotropic correlation peaks.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Controllable Synthesis of Covalently&#8208;Crosslinked Poly(ionic liquid) Nanoporous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an exciting synthetic procedure for the scalable and controllable fabrication of covalently crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) nanoporous membranes (CPILMs) in water solution under ambient conditions. We found that the pore sizes, flexibility and compositions of freestanding CPILMs can be finely tailored by a rational structural choice of PIL, diketone and aldehyde. Studies on the CPILM formation mechanism revealed that hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced phase separation of amino&#8208;functionalized homo&#8208;PIL between its polar and apolar domains coupled with structural rearrangements due to the Debus Radsizewski reaction&#8208;triggered ambient covalent crosslinking process created a stable three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected pore system in water solution. Employing structurally stable CPILMs in ion sieving devices resulted in an excellent Li+/Mg2+ separation efficiency due to the positively charged nature and &#8220;Donann&#8221; effects. This green, facile yet versatile approach to the production of CPILMs is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for making useful nanoporous functional polyelectrolyte membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is currently hampered by the high difficulty and cost in the syntheses of suitable chiral materials and the notorious chirality diminishment issue in electrical devices. Herein, diastereomeric Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes with chiral (+/&#8722;)&#8208;camphorsulfonate counteranions are readily synthesized and used as the active materials in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells to generate promising CPELs. The addition of the chiral ionic liquid (+/&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole camphorsulfonate into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (~10&#8208;3), in stark contrast to the very weak circularly polarized photoluminescence of the spin&#8208;coated films of these diastereomeric complexes. Control experiments with enantiopure Ir(III) complexes suggest that the chiral anions play a dominant role in the electrically&#8208;induced amplification of CPELs.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling of Polybutadiene Facilitated by Selenium&#8208;Mediated Allylic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accumulation of end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics presents ongoing environmental concerns. One strategy to solve this grand challenge is to invent new techniques that modify post&#8208;consumer waste and impart new functionality. While promising approaches for the chemical upcycling of commodity polyolefins and polyaromatics exist, analogous approaches to repurpose unsaturated polymers (e.g., polybutadiene) are scarce. In this work, we propose a method to upcycle polybutadiene, one of the most widely used commercial rubbers, via a mild, metal&#8208;free allylic amination reaction. The resulting materials have tunable thermal and surface wetting properties as a function of both sulfonamide identity and grafting density. Importantly, this approach maintains the parent alkene microstructure without evidence of olefin reduction, olefin transposition, and/or chain scission. Based on these findings, we anticipate future applications in the remediation of complex elastomers and vulcanized rubbers.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Oxygen Dilemma in Photoredox Catalysis: Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Light&#8208;Triggered Peroxynitrite Generation for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) is closely associated with many diseases and the development of ONOO&#8722; donors provides a feasible means to understand its pathophysiological functions. However, it is challenging to develop ONOO&#8722; donors due to the difficulties in simultaneously producing highly reactive and short&#8208;lived nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;). Here, we report a conceptually new strategy to construct ONOO&#8722; donors via the rational combination of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated type I photosensitization and photoredox catalysis. The key design involves the use of a Nile blue analog, which can serve as both a type I photosensitizer and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. Intriguingly, the formation of O2&#8226;&#8722; via type I photosensitization avoids oxygen interference, which instead activates nitrobenzofurazan&#8208;based NO donors via oxygen&#8208;tolerant NIR photoredox catalysis. The simultaneous release of O2&#8226;&#8722; and NO leads to ONOO&#8722; release, showing both antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based&#8208;Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&#8208; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation. Here, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8208;). Subsequently, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface. This work also suggests that the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity could accelerate the surface reconstruction process. Hence, such a finding could add a new layer for the understanding of surface reconstruction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Nitroalkane Addition to Unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe the enantioselective intermolecular conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, via fundamental reactivity and unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including &#946;&#8208;(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and additionally catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drugs, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition states, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Molecular Switch Toward Texture&#8208;Regulated Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the periodic pH evolution during Zn plating/stripping, a pH&#8208;triggered molecular switch with reversible transformation between &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate is applied to dynamically modulate the Zn/electrolyte interface. This molecular switch strategy results in texture&#8208;regulated Zn plating, suppressive hydrogen evolution, and excellent Zn reversibility even under high depth of discharge.







Abstract
Zn electrodes in aqueous media exhibit an unstable Zn/electrolyte interface due to severe parasitic reactions and dendrite formation. Here, a dynamic Zn interface modulation based on the molecular switch strategy is reported by hiring &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) in ZnCl2/H2O electrolyte. During Zn plating, the increased interfacial alkalinity triggers molecular switch from GBL to &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). GHB strongly anchors on Zn surface via triple Zn&#8722;O bonding, leading to suppressive hydrogen evolution and texture&#8208;regulated Zn morphology. Upon Zn stripping, the fluctuant pH turns the molecular switch reaction off through the cyclization of GHB to GBL. This dynamic molecular switch strategy enables high Zn reversibility with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% and Zn||iodine batteries with high&#8208;cyclability under high Zn depth of discharge (50&#8201;%). This study demonstrates the importance of dynamic modulation for Zn electrode and realizes the reversible molecular switch strategy to enhance its reversibility.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Recovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalytic Particles for the Production of High Value Compounds and Enhanced Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nanoparticles are presented that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of an indole derivative. The particles could be readily recycled, allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;homogeneous polymeric photocatalysts are an emerging class of highly efficient and tunable photocatalytic materials, where the photocatalytic centers are easily accessible. The creation of highly efficient photocatalytic materials that can be rapidly separated and recovered is one of the critical challenges in photocatalytic chemistry. Here, we describe pH&#8208;responsive photocatalytic nanoparticles that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH, enabling easy recovery. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of indole derivative. Notably, the cationic nature of the photocatalyst accelerates reaction rate of an anionic substrate compared to uncharged species. These photocatalytic particles could be readily recycled allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.

         <title>Anticooperative Supramolecular Oligomerization Mediated by V&#8208;Shaped Monomer Design and Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V&#8208;shaped monomer derived from BODIPY has been shown to self&#8208;assemble in non&#8208;polar media into anticooperatively formed luminescent oligomers with ultrahigh thermal stability. The delicate balance between attractive interactions (unconventional C/N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B hydrogen bonds), steric side chain effects, and inefficient aromatic interactions associated with the non&#8208;preorganized V&#8208;shaped monomer geometry lead to a restricted growth into discrete oligomer stacks.







Abstract
After more than three decades of extensive investigations on supramolecular polymers, strategies for self&#8208;limiting growth still remain challenging. Herein, we exploit a new V&#8208;shaped monomer design to achieve anticooperatively formed oligomers with superior robustness and high luminescence. In toluene, the monomer&#8208;oligomer equilibrium is shifted to the monomer side, enabling the elucidation of the molecular packing modes and the resulting (weak) anticooperativity. Steric effects associated with an antiparallel staircase organization of the dyes are proposed to outcompete aromatic and unconventional B&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N/C interactions, restricting the growth at the stage of oligomers. In methylcyclohexane (MCH), the packing modes and the anticooperativity are preserved; however, pronounced solvophobic and chain&#8208;enwrapping effects lead to thermally ultrastable oligomers. Our results shed light on understanding anticooperative effects and restricted growth in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Framework Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Nanotrap for the Precise Recognition and Separation of Gold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold recovery with exceptional uptake capacity, high selectivity, and excellent recyclability has been achieved in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through the regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps within the pore surfaces.







Abstract
Utilizing weak interactions to effectively recover and separate precious metals in solution is of great importance but the practice remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve precise recognition and separation of gold by regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) nanotrap within the pore of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that both COF&#8208;HNU25 and COF&#8208;HNU26 can efficiently capture AuIII with fast kinetics, high selectivity, and uptake capacity. In particular, the COF&#8208;HNU25 with the high density of H&#8208;bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that (219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) of its isostructural COF (COF&#8208;42) without H&#8208;bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H&#8208;bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl4]&#8722; in water, and multiple H&#8208;bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8722;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) via C&#8722;H activation is the latest addition in the repertoire of synthetic strategies towards conjugated polymers. This article captures the development of this polymerization strategy in the light of background small molecule reactions with highlighting its greener approach than the previous methods. Arene&#8211;arene and arene&#8211;alkene couplings via transition metal catalysts have been explored for CDC polymerization.







Abstract
Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom&#8208;efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8722;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization.

     alt="Cross-Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8722;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) via C&#8722;H activation is the latest addition in the repertoire of synthetic strategies towards conjugated polymers. This article captures the development of this polymerization strategy in the light of background small molecule reactions with highlighting its greener approach than the previous methods. Arene&#8211;arene and arene&#8211;alkene couplings via transition metal catalysts have been explored for CDC polymerization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross-coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom-efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor-acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8722;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck-type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization. In this article, we discuss the development of CDC polymerization protocols along with the relevant small molecule CDC reactions for an improved understanding of these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes by Ligand&#8208;Directed Co/Al and Co/Mg Cooperative Catalysis
</title>

         <dc:description>
Co/Al&#8208; and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide bifunctional ligand, have been developed for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with alkynes. Pyridines, pyridones, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines are efficiently alkenylated at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen. A ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer process is proposed as a general mechanism of these C&#8722;H activations.







Abstract
We report herein the design and development of Co/Al and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide (PSPO) bifunctional ligand, for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroarenes with alkynes. These catalysts enable the alkenylation of pyridine, pyridone, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen atom, which represents a selectivity profile distinct from that of the previously developed cobalt&#8208;diphosphine/aluminum catalyst. The alkenylated products were obtained in moderate to good yields using various heterocycles and differently substituted internal alkynes. Kinetic isotope effect experiments suggest the irreversibility of the C&#8722;H activation step, the relevance of which to the rate&#8208;limiting step depends on the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer is the common mechanism of C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Studies on Substrate and Stereoselectivity of the Indole Monooxygenase VpIndA1: New Avenues for Biocatalytic Epoxidations and Sulfoxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of a group E flavoprotein monooxygenase in complex with substrates and products reveals a confined hydrophobic binding pocket that controls the stereoselectivity of sulfoxidation or epoxidation reactions. Molecular mechanics force&#8208;field calculations and kinetic studies allowed structure&#8208;based redesign of this cavity, resulting in variants with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity or acceptance of novel substrates.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases are a versatile group of enzymes for biocatalytic transformations. Among these, group E monooxygenases (GEMs) catalyze enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an indole monooxygenase from the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS, a GEM designated as VpIndA1. Complex structures with substrates reveal productive binding modes that, in conjunction with force&#8208;field calculations and rapid mixing kinetics, reveal the structural basis of substrate and stereoselectivity. Structure&#8208;based redesign of the substrate cavity yielded variants with new substrate selectivity (for sulfoxidation of benzyl phenyl sulfide) or with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity (from 35.1&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;% ee for production of (1S,2R)&#8208;indene oxide). This first determination of the substrate binding mode of GEMs combined with structure&#8208;function relationships opens the door for structure&#8208;based design of these powerful biocatalysts.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Low&#8208;Melting Metal Salt Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;melting metal (hydrate) salts as both the precursor and the solvent for ionothermal synthesis, a range of stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be prepared with high crystallinity and porosity and minimal use of organic solvents.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low&#8208;melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high&#8208;quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared under these ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user&#8208;friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal&#8208;organic materials.

         <dc:description>Many living organisms have the superb structure&#8208;editing capacity for better adaptation in dynamic environments over the course of their life cycle. However, it&#8217;s still challenging to replicate such natural structure&#8208;editing capacity into artificial hydrogel actuating systems for enhancing environment&#8208;interactive functions. Herein, we learn from the metamorphosis development of glowing octopus to construct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept fluorescent hydrogel actuators with life&#8208;like structure&#8208;editing capacity by developing a universal stepwise inside&#8208;out growth strategy. These actuators could perform origami&#8208;like 3D shape deformation and also enable the postnatal growth of new structures to adapt additional actuating states for different visual information delivery by using different environment keys (e.g., temperature, pH). This study opens previously unidentified&#8208;avenues of bio&#8208;inspired hydrogel actuators/robotics and extends the potential uses for environment&#8208;interactive information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Responsive Charge&#8208;Switchable Lipid Nanoparticles for Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have a profound clinical impact on nuclear acid&#8208;based therapy and vaccination. Recombinant human insulin, a negatively&#8208;charged biomolecule like mRNA, may also be delivered by rationally&#8208;designed positively&#8208;charged lipid nanoparticles with glucose&#8208;sensing elements and be released in a glucose&#8208;responsive manner. Herein, we have designed phenylboronic acid&#8208;based quaternary amine&#8208;type cationic lipids that can self&#8208;assemble into spherical lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. Upon mixing insulin and the lipid nanoparticles, a heterostructured insulin complex is formed immediately arising from the electrostatic attraction. In a hyperglycemia&#8208;relevant glucose solution, lipid nanoparticles become less positively charged over time, leading to reduced attraction and subsequent insulin release. Compared with native insulin, this lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based glucose&#8208;responsive insulin shows prolonged blood glucose regulation ability and blood glucose&#8208;triggered insulin release in type 1 diabetic mouse model.</dc:description>

Herein, we have designed phenylboronic acid-based quaternary amine-type cationic lipids that can self-assemble into spherical lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. Upon mixing insulin and the lipid nanoparticles, a heterostructured insulin complex is formed immediately arising from the electrostatic attraction. In a hyperglycemia-relevant glucose solution, lipid nanoparticles become less positively charged over time, leading to reduced attraction and subsequent insulin release. Compared with native insulin, this lipid nanoparticle-based glucose-responsive insulin shows prolonged blood glucose regulation ability and blood glucose-triggered insulin release in type 1 diabetic mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Bandgap Emission for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) feature bright and tunable photoluminescence, solution processability, and low toxicity, showing great potential in optoelectronics. However, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs with near&#8208;unity&#160;photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has not been achieved so far. In this study,&#160;we perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped CQDs (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity PLQY (96%).&#160;Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the large vertically oriented transition dipole moment of H&#8208;CQDs originating from high symmetry results in nearly 100% PLQY.&#160;The H&#8208;CQDs also exhibited a high electron mobility of up to 0.07 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. These properties enable the H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6% and a record maximum brightness of over 11000 cd m&#8208;2. This study represents a significant advance that CQDs&#8208;based electroluminescent device can be utilized for potential display and lighting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#160; [[EQUATION]] 234 J mol&#8208;1 K&#8208;1 (c.f.:  [[EQUATION]] &#160;83 J mol&#8208;1 K&#8208;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73 eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. &#160;We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanes from Carbon Pronucleophiles and Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are desirable structural motifs with valuable applications in drug discovery and beyond. Established alkene cyclopropanation methods give rise to cyclopropanes with a limited array of substituents, are difficult to scale, or both. Herein, we disclose a new cyclopropane synthesis through the formal coupling of abundant carbon pronucleophiles and unactivated alkenes. This strategy relies on key dicationic adducts derived from anodic oxidation of thianthrene in the presence of alkene substrates. We find that these unusual dielectrophiles undergo cyclopropanation with methylene pronucleophiles via alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates. This protocol is scalable, proceeds with high diastereoselectivity, and tolerates diverse functional groups on both the alkene and pronucleophile coupling partners. Furthermore, cyclopropanation of gaseous feedstock alkenes enables access to stereochemically&#8208;defined cyclopropane building blocks from inexpensive precursors. To validate the utility of this new procedure, we prepared an array of substituted analogs of an established cyclopropane intermediate en route to multiple top selling pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetism in Nonplanar Zigzag Edge Termini of Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanographenes synthesized by on&#8208;surface reaction using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors offer an ideal playground for a study of magnetism towards nano&#8208;spintronics. Although the zigzag edge of GNRs has been known to host magnetism, underlying metal substrates usually veil the edge&#8208;induced Kondo effect. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended 7&#8208;armchair GNRs using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. Characterizations by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy revealed unique rearrangement reactions leading to pentagon&#8208; or pentagon/heptagon&#8208;incorporated, nonplanar zigzag termini, which demonstrated Kondo resonance even on bare Au(111). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nonplanar structure significantly reduces the interaction between the zigzag terminus and the Au(111), leading to a recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag edge. Such distortion of planar GNR structures offers a degree of freedom to control the magnetism on metal substrates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via a two&#8208;electron (2e&#8208;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process provides a promising alternative to replace the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts is still facing lots of challenges like insufficient understanding of active sites. Herein, we develop a facile template&#8208;protected strategy to synthesize a highly active quinone&#8208;rich porous carbon catalyst (PCC) for H2O2 electrochemical production. The optimized PCC900 exhibits unprecedented activity and selectivity, of which the onset potential reaches 0.83 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M KOH and the H2O2 selectivity is over 95 % in a wide potential range. Comprehensive synchrotron&#8208;based near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy combined with electrocatalytic characterizations reveals the positive correlation between quinone content and 2e&#8208; ORR performance. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the molecule&#8208;mimic strategy and theoretical analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphological profiling identifies the motor protein Eg5 as cellular target of spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxindoles and iso&#8208;oxindoles are natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds that provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel biologically relevant compound classes. Notably, the spirocyclic connection of oxindoles with iso&#8208;oxindoles has not been explored by nature but promises to provide structurally related bioactive compounds endowed with novel bioactivity. Therefore, methods for their efficient synthesis and the conclusive discovery of their cellular targets are highly desirable. We describe a selective Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles from differently protected diazooxindoles and N&#8208;pivaloyloxy aryl amides which includes a functional group&#8208;controlled Lossen rearrangement as key step. Unbiased morphological profiling of a corresponding compound collection in the Cell Painting assay efficiently identified the mitotic kinesin Eg5 as the cellular target of the spirooxindoles, which defines a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through&#160;Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Addition of an Organolithium Reagent.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of C&#8208;fluorocurine, C&#8208;profluorocurine, C&#8208;mavacurine, normavacurine, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed an original strategy which involves a late stage construction of the D ring via a Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2&#8208;indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent onto a readily accessible Michael acceptor via the assistance of the piperiridine nitrogen through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved via nucleophilic substitution into an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine were finalized via respectively the dihydroxylation of C&#8208;mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Restructuring and Activation of Cu (111) under Electrocatalytic Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first&#8208;principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4&#215;4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution on Electrode&#8208;Supported Ptn Clusters: Ensemble of Hydride States Governs the Size Dependent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the size&#8208;dependent activity and stability of supported Pt1,4,7,8&#160;for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size&#8208;dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (~2 H/Pt). An ensemble&#8208;based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;coverage&#8208;dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.</dc:description>

         <title>Photopolymerization&#8208;Driven Macroscopic Mechanical Motions of a Composite Film Containing a Vinyl Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a unique vinyl coordination polymer (CP), [Zn(4&#8208;Fb)2(tkpvb)] n (1, 4&#8208;HFb = 4&#8208;fluorobenzoic acid, tkpvb = 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridylvinyl)benzene) that undergoes a rare photopolymerization reaction to form a two&#8208;dimensional CP integrated with a one&#8208;dimensional linear organic polymer. Upon light irradiation at different wavelengths, 1 exhibits an unprecedented phenomenon of photoinduced nonlinear lattice expansion. 1 can be uniformly dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form the composite film of 1&#8208;PVA. When this film is exposed to UV light, internal minute stresses within crystallites are released by lattice expansion, resulting in a variety of photopolymerization&#8208;driven macroscopic mechanical motions. The findings provide new insights into the conversion of small lattice expansions of CPs into macroscopic mechanical motions based on photopolymerization reactions, which can promote the development of CPs&#8208;based smart photoactuators in the burgeoning field of microrobotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in a Supported Copper/ZnO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/H2O mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H2 during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H2O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1&#8208;propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dictated Regiodivergent Allylic Functionalizations via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from classical allylic substitutions requiring a vicinal leaving group, an olefin bearing a remote leaving group is scarcely viewed as a potential allylation substrate. Here we describe feasible protocols to achieve the regiodivergent allylic C&#8208;H functionalizations via palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution, which provides a novel strategy for seldomly studied migratory Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction. With the dictation of a suitable ligand, a process&#160;involved 4,3&#8208;hydrofunctionalization of the generated conjugated diene intermediate via metal walking is observed in generally &gt;20:1 regioselectivity. Unexpectedly, related 1,4&#8208;hydrofunctionalization pathway is tuned to work as a major route with a newly synthesized electron&#8208;rich bisphosphine ligand, which breakouts the conventional viewpoint on the potential regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalizations of linear internal conjugated dienes via &#414;3&#8208;substitution. A series of deuterium experiments and kinetic studies provide preliminary insight into the potential catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Control of One&#8208;Handed Helicity in Polyacetylenes through Flexible Spacers in Water: Impact of the Spacer Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unprecedented sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S)&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains. A small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (&#8804; 10 mol %) introduced at the terminal of the achiral OEG spacers as many as 80 bonds away from the polymer backbones induced a complete one&#8208;handed helix in water through preferential intramolecular encapsulation of the binaphthyl groups within a cavity of the copolymers. A fully one&#8208;handed helix can be induced virtually independent of the OEG spacer length and concentrations. At a specific spacer length, however, its helix&#8208;sense was inverted. The copolymers also form an excess one&#8208;handed helix in organic solvents in an OEG spacer&#8208;length dependent manner, yet far from the polymer backbones. We show the superiority of the present covalent&#8208;bond driven S&amp;S&#8208;type remote helicity control over the corresponding noncovalent helicity induction approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.







Abstract
The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation of gold compounds in nanocarriers or their chemical grafting onto targeted delivery vectors could lead to new nanomedicines that eventually reach clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of gold anticancer compounds, andmore importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Novel Strategy to Drive the Intracellular Uptake of Lipid Nanoparticles for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior efficacy of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipid nanoparticles in comparison to standard liposomal nanoparticles is described by Juan Chen, Gang Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.20218218). EDTA&#8211;lipid incorporated nanoparticles fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner and improve delivery to the cell by 25&#8208;fold. This novel nanoparticle design feature can be deployed across lipid nanoparticles to accelerate cancer nanomedicine drug delivery.

         <title>Dynamically Resettable Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface through Supramolecular Sol&#8208;Gel Transition Electrolyte for Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte that can dynamically reset damaged electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and accommodate deformations/dendrites is developed, providing a general strategy to enhance interface stability in flexible batteries.







Abstract
Flexible batteries based on gel electrolytes with high safety are promising power solutions for wearable electronics but suffer from vulnerable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces especially upon complex deformations, leading to irreversible capacity loss or even battery collapse. Here, a supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte (SGTE) that can dynamically accommodate deformations and repair electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces through its controllable rewetting at low temperatures is designed. Mediated by the micellization of polypropylene oxide blocks in Pluronic and host&#8208;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) and polyethylene oxide blocks, the high ionic conductivity and compatibility with various salts of SGTE afford resettable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and thus constructions of a series of highly durable, flexible aqueous zinc batteries. The design of this novel gel electrolyte provides new insights for the development of flexible batteries.

         <title>Reductive Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement by 1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade transformation of chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of a conjugate reduction, enantiospecific [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement, and subsequent S&#8722;O bond reductive cleavage provides access to synthetically valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. Various &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities under very mild conditions.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene hydrides (DAP&#8722;H) enable smooth conjugate reduction of polarized double bonds. The transiently formed phosphorus&#8208;enolate provides a potential platform for reductive &#945;&#8208;functionalizations. In this respect, asymmetric C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes are synthetically appealing but remain elusive. We report a 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade reaction of N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of conjugate reduction, [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement and subsequent S&#8722;O bond cleavage. The obtained enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are formed in good yields and excellent enantiospecificity. The stereo&#8208;defined P&#8208;bound N,O&#8208;ketene aminal ensures an excellent transfer of chirality from the sulfur stereocenter to &#945;&#8208;carbon. The transformation operates under mild conditions at ambient temperature. Moreover, DAP&#8722;H is a competent reductant for the cleavage of formed sulfenate ester, eliminating the extra step in traditional Mislow&#8208;Evans processes.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Coupling of Secondary Alcohols, Primary Alcohols and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohol, primary alcohol and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated alcohol with high chemoselectivity is presented.







Abstract
Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohols, primary alcohols and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated secondary alcohols. Using our method, a series of 1&#8208;arylethanol, benzyl alcohol derivatives, and methanol undergo sequential coupling efficiently to construct assembled alcohols with high chemoselectivity in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via methylation of a benzylated secondary alcohol intermediate to generate the final product.

         <title>Determining the Physico&#8208;Chemical Composition of Biomolecular Condensates from Spatially&#8208;Resolved NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the molecular complexity and dynamic nature of biomolecular condensates, effective tools to investigate their composition and structure have been lacking. Improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR enables the quantification of multiple components in biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and in a label&#8208;free fashion. The ability to simultaneously observe proteins, small molecules, and water is expected to have a major impact on understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;Liquid phase separation has emerged as fundamental process underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Insights into the composition and structure of biomolecular condensates is, however, complicated by their molecular complexity and dynamics. Here, we introduce an improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR experiment that enables quantitative analysis of the physico&#8208;chemical composition of multi&#8208;component biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and label&#8208;free. Application of spatially&#8208;resolved NMR to condensates formed by the Alzheimer's disease&#8208;associated protein Tau demonstrates decreased water content, exclusion of the molecular crowding agent dextran, presence of a specific chemical environment of the small molecule DSS, and &#8776;150&#8208;fold increased concentration of Tau inside the condensate. The results suggest that spatially&#8208;resolved NMR can have a major impact in understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Unsymmetrical Bis&#8208;Allylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes has been developed by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkenes and nucleophilic allylboronates as the allylic reagents. With the aid of a robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
The catalytic bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes is an important but challenging protocol to construct all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes. Particularly, the catalytic unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes remains as an underexplored task to date. We herein report an unprecedented unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkene and nucleophilic allylboronate as the allylic reagents. With the aid of robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction may proceed through a &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination of a nickelacycle followed by a transmetalation step with allylboronate. The present method exhibits a good tolerance of various functional groups. Besides, the skipped triene products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Divalent Lanthanide Tetraisobutylaluminates: Reactivity and Living Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic isobutylaluminates [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) display single&#8208;component catalysts for cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization. Chlorination with C2Cl6 affords highly symmetric, mostly inactive clusters such as mixed&#8208;valent [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6], while activation of [Yb(AliBu4)2] with [PhNMe2H][B(C6F5)4] gives divalent &#8220;[Yb(AliBu4){AliBu3(PhNMe2)}][B(C6F5)4]&#8221; promoting ideal living polymerization.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln) tetraisobutylaluminates constitute key components in commercial 1,3&#8208;diene polymerization catalysts, and likewise are the homogeneous rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts of prime industrial importance. Discrete divalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) reported here display the first structurally characterized homoleptic metal tetraisobutylaluminates. Treatment of [Ln(AliBu4)2] with C2Cl6 gives access to SmII/SmIII mixed&#8208;valence cluster [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6] and the YbII cluster [Yb4Cl4(AliBu4)4], respectively. Reaction with B(C6F5)3 leads to hydride abstraction and formation of arene&#8208;coordinated hydroborates such as [Sm{HB(C6F5)3}2(toluene)2]. Complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] engage in single&#8208;component isoprene polymerization, affording high cis&#8208;1,4 polyisoprenes with narrow molecular weight distributions. Binary [Yb(AliBu4)2]/[HNPhMe2][B(C6F5)4] fabricates polyisoprene in a perfectly living manner. The catalytically active species are scrutinized by NMR spectroscopy.

Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides has been achieved by using palladium(II) catalysis with a chiral sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligand. We report herein an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides (up to 93&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee), in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.







Abstract
Amide is one of the most widespread functional groups in organic and bioorganic chemistry, and it would be valuable to achieve stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in amide molecules. Palladium(II) catalysis has been prevalently used in the C&#8722;H activation chemistry in the past decades, however, due to the weakly&#8208;coordinating feature of simple amides, it is challenging to achieve their direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization with enantiocontrol by PdII catalysis. Our group has developed sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligands, which exhibited remarkable activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation. In this work, we demonstrate that chiral SOHP ligands served as an ideal solution to enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides. Herein, we report an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides, in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic method to synthetically versatile chiral triflones with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers was developed. The work uses, for the first time, &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones as Michael acceptors in stereoselective catalysis. Control over the absolute configuration is achieved by a catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation&#8208;protonation sequence.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylsulfones (triflones) are useful compounds for synthesis and beyond. Yet, methods to access chiral triflones are scarce. Here, we present a mild and efficient organocatalytic method for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral triflones using &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones, building blocks previously unexplored in asymmetric synthesis. The peptide&#8208;catalyzed reaction gives rise to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;triflylaldehydes with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. A catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective protonation following a C&#8722;C bond formation is key to control over the absolute and relative configuration. Straightforward derivatization of the products into, e.g., disubstituted &#948;&#8208;sultones, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and pyrrolidine heterocycles highlights the synthetic versatility of the products.

         <title>Manipulating Host&#8208;Guest Charge Transfer of a Water&#8208;Soluble Double&#8208;Cavity Cyclophane for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane with high electron&#8208;deficiency has been shown to bind two electron&#8208;rich guests and extend the charge&#8208;transfer absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The use of a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain led to a biocompatible host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects for cancer cell and bacterial ablation.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) over NIR&#8208;II biowindow (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm) are highly desirable, but the rarity greatly limits their applications. Based on a water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane GBox&#8208;44+, we report a class of host&#8211;guest charge transfer (CT) complexes as structurally uniform PTAs for NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. As a result of its high electron&#8208;deficiency, GBox&#8208;44+ can bind different electron&#8208;rich planar guests with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host/guest stoichiometry to readily tune the CT absorption band that extends to the NIR&#8208;II region. When using a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain, the host&#8211;guest system realized both good biocompatibility and enhanced photothermal conversion at 1064&#8197;nm, and was then exploited as a high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;II PTA for cancer cell and bacterial ablation. This work broadens the potential applications of host&#8211;guest cyclophane systems and provides a new access to bio&#8208;friendly NIR&#8208;II photoabsorbers with well&#8208;defined structures.

         <title>Salt Metathesis: Tetrafluoroborate Anion Rapidly Fluoridates Organoboronic Acids to give Organotrifluoroborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt metathesis and BFX&#160;(boron&#8211;fluoride exchange) of BF4&#8722;&#160;with boronic acids generates&#160;RBF3 derivatives thus showing the solvolytic lability of BF4&#8722;&#160;that enables its use as a fluorinating agent, even though many highly reactive reagents employ BF4&#8722; as a non&#8208;reactive counter anion. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215371), David&#8197;M. Perrin and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of RBF3&#8722; derivatives via a salt metathesis reaction using a series of MBF4&#160;salts in methanol. This work highlights the proclivity of BF4&#8722;, generally considered weakly coordinating and unreactive, to rapidly fluorinate boronic acids.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Regulation to Restrain Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination for Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite LEDs with EQE Exceeding 15%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) remains the fundamental challenge that impedes perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) towards commercial applications.&#160;The bottleneck accounting for the inefficient blue PeLEDs is broadly attributed to the poor&#8208;emissive blue perovskite emitters based on either mixed halide engineering or reduced&#8208;dimensional strategy. Herein, we report the high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (490 nm) with the maximum EQE exceeding 15% by incorporating a molecular modifier, namely 4,4'&#8208;Difluorophenone, for significantly suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and tuning of the low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution of quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskites, which represents a remarkable paradigm for developing the new generation of blue lighting sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Synthesis Kinetics of Single&#8208;Crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;equilibrium kinetic intermediates are usually preferentially generated, rather than thermodynamic stable phases in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of layered oxides. Understanding the inherent complexity between thermodynamics and kinetics is important for designing high cationic ordering cathodes. Single&#8208;crystal strategy is an effective way to solve the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical problems of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the synthesis of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal is very challenging. Herein, we explored a dynamically cationic ordering/disordering process in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich (NM9505) to better understand the structural and morphological changes involved in the phase evolution process through non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates. We demonstrate that the kinetic reaction paths are regulated during the synthesis process to promote a low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation, which can reduce the defective intermediate structures and effectively inhibit the electrochemical&#8208;thermal&#8208;mechanical failure. This work provides a basis for designing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides by regulating the non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates to obtain the required structural/electrochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Tunneling Distances for Metal Hydrides Formation Manage the Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of manganese polypyridine complexes were prepared as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. In these catalysts, the intramolecular proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696 &#197; while the structural, energetic and electronic factors remain essentially close. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH within a difference of ca. 0.3 &#197; in PTD&#8208;MH. Specifically, the catalyst functionalized with a pendent phenol group featuring a slightly longer PTD&#8208;MH prefers the binding of proton to the [Mn&#8208;CO2] adduct rather than the Mn center and results in ca. 100% selectivity for CO product. By contrast, decreasing the PTD&#8208;MH by attaching a dangling tertiary amine in the same catalyst skeleton facilitates the proton binding on the Mn center and switches the product from CO to HCOOH with a selectivity of 86%.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser writing of block&#8208;copolymer images into mesopores using SBDC initiated visible light induced polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For miniaturization, as well as improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are necessary. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400 &#8211; 700 nm and 405 nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40 &#181;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8208;5 seconds for each irradiated spot.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylations to Function&#173;alized Alkenes and C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient radical&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C coupling through photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO). This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild photocatalytic method has excellent functional group tolerance and affords vinylated products in good yields, with complete retention of the alkene configuration. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the diastereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8208;C bond formation is stereospecific and proceeds through a concerted radical coupling transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>C64 Nanographene Tetraimide &#8211; a Receptor for Phthalocyanines with Subnanomolar Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines are extensively used by the dye and pigment industry and in photovoltaic and photodynamic therapy research due to their intense absorption of visible light, outstanding stability and versatility. As pigments, the unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble owing to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8722;stacking interactions which causes limitations for solution chemistry for both free base and metalated phthalocyanines. Here we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to dissolve phthalocyanines into solution. C64 nanographene tetraimide (1) binds two free base/zinc/copper phthalocyanines in a 1:2 stoichiometry to solubilize phthalocyanines as evidenced by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Binding studies using a tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted soluble phthalocyanine revealed binding affinities of up to 109 M&#8208;1 in tetrachloromethane, relating to a Gibbs free energy of &#8211; 52 kJmol&#8208;1. Energy decomposition analysis revealed that complexes between 1 and phthalocyanines are stabilized by dispersion interactions followed by electrostatics as well as significant charge&#8208;transfer interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mosaic CuI&#8210;CuII&#8210;InIII 2D Perovskites: Pressure&#8208;Dependence of the Intervalence Charge Transfer and a Mechanochemical Alloying Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2D perovskite (BA)4[CuII(CuIInIII)0.5]Cl8 (1BA; BA+ = butylammonium) allows us to study the high&#8208;pressure structural, optical, and transport properties of a mixed&#8208;valence 2D perovskite. Compressing 1BA reduces the onset energy of CuI/II intervalence charge transfer from 1.2 eV at ambient pressure to 0.2 eV at 21 GPa. The electronic conductivity of 1BA increases by 4 orders of magnitude upon compression to 20 GPa, when the activation energy for conduction decreases to 0.16 eV. In contrast, CuII perovskites achieve similar conductivity at ~50 GPa. The solution&#8208;state synthesis of these perovskites is complicated, with more undesirable side products likely from the precursor mixtures containing three different metals. To circumvent this problem, we demonstrate an efficient mechanochemical synthesis to expand this family of halide perovskites with complex composition by simply pulverizing together powders of 2D CuII single perovskites and CuIInIII double perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>The First UV Nonlinear Optical Selenite Material: Fluorination Control in CaYF(SeO3)2 and Y3F(SeO3)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;centrosymmetric hydrogen&#8208;free selenite Y3F(SeO3)4 was synthesized from the centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2 by controlling the fluorine content. Y3F(SeO3)4 features large SHG intensity, wide band gap, short UV cut&#8208;off edge and high thermal stability.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to develop UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material due to the demanding conditions of strong second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and wide band gap. The first ultraviolet NLO selenite material, Y3F(SeO3)4, has been obtained by control of the fluorine content in a centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2. The two new compounds represent similar 3D structures composed of 3D yttrium open frameworks strengthened by selenite groups. CaYF(SeO3)2 has a large birefringence (0.138@532&#8197;nm and 0.127@1064&#8197;nm) and a wide optical band gap (5.06&#8197;eV). The non&#8208;centrosymmetric Y3F(SeO3)4 can exhibit strong SHG intensity (5.5&#215;KDP@1064&#8197;nm), wide band gap (5.03&#8197;eV), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (204&#8197;nm) and high thermal stability (690&#8201;&#176;C). So, Y3F(SeO3)4 is a new UV NLO material with excellent comprehensive properties. Our work shows that it is an effective method to develop new UV NLO selenite material by fluorination control of the centrosymmetric compounds.

         <title>Electroreduction Enables Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes with Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing cyanoarene radical anions as redox&#8208;mediators, the electrochemical regioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes with cyanoarenes and aryl halides takes place in the absence of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The merit of this method has been well demonstrated by its wide scope, excellent regioselectivity, and powerful scale&#8208;up synthesis.

Precisely introducing two similar functional groups into bulk chemical alkenes represents a formidable route to complex molecules. Especially, the selective activation of two electrophiles is in crucial demand, yet challenging for cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling. Herein, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis, in which aryl nitriles are both aryl radical precursors and redox&#8208;mediators, enables an intermolecular alkene 1,2&#8208;diarylation with a remarkable regioselectivity, thereby avoiding the involvement of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This transformation utilizes cyanoarene radical anions for activating various aryl halides (including iodides, bromides, and even chlorides) and affords 1,2&#8208;diarylation adducts in up to 83&#8201;% yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 regioselectivity with more than 80 examples, providing a feasible approach to complex bibenzyl derivatives.

         <title>Photoswitchable Oxidopyrylium Ylide for Photoclick Reaction with High Spatiotemporal Precision: A Dynamic Switching Strategy to Compensate for Molecular Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoswitching equilibrium between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) is governed by dual&#8208;&#955; gating, in which PY can undergo fast [5+2] cycloaddition with BCN. A photoswitchable strategy for photoclick labeling with spatiotemporal control was developed, recycling the unreacted PY to minimize side&#8208;effects. Also, molecular diffusion of the reactive PY was compensated for by improvement of the spatial accuracy.







Abstract
We describe a novel type of photoclick reaction between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and ring&#8208;strained dipolarophiles, in which DIO serves as a P&#8208;type photoswitch to produce mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) to initiate an ultra&#8208;fast [5+2] cycloaddition (k2h&#957;=1.9&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). The photoisomerization between DIO and PY can be tightly controlled by either 365 or 520&#8197;nm photo&#8208;stimulation, which allows reversion or regeneration of the reactive PY dipole on demand. Thus, this reversible photoactivation was exploited to increase the chemoselectivity of the [5+2] cycloaddition in complex environments via temporal dual&#8208;&#955; stimulation sequences and to recycle the DIO reagent for batch&#8208;wise protein conjugation. A dynamic photoswitching strategy is also proposed to compensate for molecular diffusion of PY in aqueous solution, enhancing the spatial resolution of lithographic surface decoration and bioorthogonal labeling on living cells via a spatiotemporal dual&#8208;&#955; photo&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from Achiral Luminescent Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel near ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) properties are developed, which can sensitize diverse achiral luminescent materials to produce efficient CP&#8208;EL with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL efficiencies.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) is generally produced in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on special CP luminescent (CPL) materials, while common achiral luminescent materials are rarely considered to be capable of direct producing CP&#8208;EL. Herein, near ultraviolet CPL materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields and good CPL dissymmetry factors are developed, which can induce blue to red CPL for various achiral luminescent materials. Strong near ultraviolet CP&#8208;EL with the best external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 9.0&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved by using them as emitters for CP&#8208;OLEDs. By adopting them as hosts or sensitizers, commercially available yellow&#8208;orange achiral phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF materials can generate intense CP&#8208;EL, with high dissymmetry factors and outstanding &#951;exts (30.8&#8201;%), demonstrating a simple and universal avenue towards efficient CP&#8208;EL.

         <title>Fucose Migration Pathways Identified Using Infrared Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass&#8208;spectrometric study of fucosylated oligosaccharides is arduous due to the propensity of fucose to migrate in the gas phase&#8212;especially during the collision&#8208;induced dissociation step (but not always). Gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy has shown its potential to identify fucose migration products. The investigations have also shown a new type of migration.







Abstract
Fucose is a ubiquitous monosaccharide associated to major classes of glycans. A main obstacle to the sequencing of fucosylated glycans is the migration of fucose, which leads to misinterpretations in mass spectrometry analysis. Here, using ion vibrational spectroscopy, we resolve the structure of fucosylated fragments of Lewis and blood group H antigen trisaccharides and we unveil the position and linkage of the fucose after migration. Our findings demonstrate that the structure of fragment ions resulting from fucose migration can be characterized. Additionally, we report a new type of fucose migration, which does not feature any change of mass and therefore had not been previously reported: it consists of a local migration where the fucose changes its position remaining on the initial residue. Our approach allows the characterization of glycans, an essential step to interpret glycomics data, as well as to understand underlying processes at play in mass spectrometry.

         <title>Reactivities of &#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA Gold Carbenes Generated by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of BMIDA&#8208;Terminated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA gold carbenes are oxidatively generated from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. With the electrophilicity modulated by BMIDA, these carbene species undergo C&#8722;H insertion in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. This chemistry provides expedient access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones, which are scarcely documented.







Abstract
An oxidative strategy is reported to access &#945;&#8208;oxo BMIDA gold carbenes directly from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. Besides offering expedient access to seldom studied boryl metal carbenes, these BMIDA gold carbene species undergo facile insertions into methyl, methylene, methine, and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. They also undergo efficient OH insertion, cyclopropanation, and F&#8722;C alkylations. This chemistry provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;BMIDA ketones, which are scarcely documented. In combination with DFT studies, the role of BMIDA is established to be an electron&#8208;donating group that attenuates the high electrophilicity of the gold carbene center.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Weak Solvating Molecule Regulation for Stable Li Deposition in High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Li deposition in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is achieved through rationally designing the solvation environment. Anisole was screened out to sliced ionic aggregate to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic clusters, which significantly accelerates Li+ transport process in bulk electrolyte and SEI. The performance of Li&#8722;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI&#8208;IL can stabilize O2&#8722; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li+ transport in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic aggregate in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li+ transport parameters but also anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li+ transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life (2000&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, Li&#8722;O2 batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16&#8197;V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

     alt="Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Weak Solvating Molecule Regulation for Stable Li Deposition in High-Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust Li deposition in TFSI-IL electrolyte is achieved through rationally designing the solvation environment. Anisole was screened out to sliced ionic aggregate to generate anisole-doped ionic clusters, which significantly accelerates Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport process in bulk electrolyte and SEI. The performance of Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide-based ionic liquid (TFSI-IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI-IL can stabilize O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport in TFSI-IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole-doped ionic aggregate in TFSI-IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport parameters but also anion-derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and long cycle life (2000&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16&#8197;V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides an effective electrolyte design principle to realize stable Li deposition and high-performance Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Propagation of a Minimal Catalytic RNA Network in GUV Protocells by Temperature Cycling and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive RNA organelles inside giant unilamellar vesicles were exploited to increase catalytic rates of a minimal catalytic RNA network. Subsequent cycles of freezing and thawing serve as physico&#8208;chemical driver to exchange vesicle contents aiming at an efficient organelle&#8208;aided propagation of such catalytic networks across lipid vesicles.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is key to many cellular processes and a critical bottleneck of any minimal life approach. In cells, a complex chemistry is responsible for bringing together or separating biomolecules at the right place at the right time. Lipids, nucleic acids and proteins self&#8208;organize, thereby creating boundaries, interfaces and specialized microenvironments. Exploiting reversible RNA&#8208;based liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) inside giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we present an efficient system capable of propagating an RNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction across a population of GUVs upon freezing&#8208;thawing (FT) temperature cycles. We report that compartmentalization in the condensed RNA&#8208;rich phase can accelerate such an enzymatic reaction. In the decondensed state, RNA substrates become homogeneously dispersed, enabling content exchange between vesicles during freeze&#8208;thawing. This work explores how a minimal reversible phase separation system in lipid vesicles could help to implement spatiotemporal control in cyclic processes, as required for minimal cells.

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clamp&#8208;shaped cobalt(II) porphyrins(2.1.2.1) complexes were investigated as to their electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and electrocatalytic ORR. Electrochemistry indicates that the first oxidation corresponds to a CoII/CoIII process. The ORR capacities of both complexes show higher selectively for the 4e&#8722; ORR and DFT calculations suggest a lower overpotential for the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway than for the 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two CoII porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1&#8197;M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition corresponds to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8722; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.

         <title>Spectroscopy vs. Electrochemistry: Catalyst Layer Thickness Effects on Operando/In Situ Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando/in situ spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies often require high loadings and thick catalyst layers (CLs) leading to large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this study we investigate PdH&#8208;formation in two Pd&#8208;catalysts with similar surface areas but drastically different morphologies. Our results unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the PdH formation trends calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments.







Abstract
In recent years, operando/in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become an important tool in the electrocatalysis community. However, the high catalyst loadings often required to acquire XA&#8208;spectra with a satisfactory signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio frequently imply the use of thick catalyst layers (CLs) with large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. To shed light on the impact of this variable on the spectro&#8208;electrochemical results, in this study we investigate Pd&#8208;hydride formation in carbon&#8208;supported Pd&#8208;nanoparticles (Pd/C) and an unsupported Pd&#8208;aerogel with similar Pd surface areas but drastically different morphologies and electrode packing densities. Our in situ XAS and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements with different loadings unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the hydride formation trends inferred from spectro&#8208;electrochemical experiments, therewith calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments and the use of complementary thin&#8208;film control measurements.

         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes is developed. The method provides a modular and efficient access to P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides while also realizing the precise kinetic resolution of secondary phosphine oxides. Given the verified promise of the chiral phosphines as the chiral ligands, this work considerably enriches the toolkit of asymmetric metal catalysis.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes by secondary phosphine oxides is described. A variety of P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides are synthesized with high yields and ees, of which both the substituents of phosphines and azaarenes can be flexibly modulated, underscoring an exceptionally broad scope of substrates. These adducts are valuable to asymmetric metal catalysis since the resultant P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines from the reduction of them are verified as a kind of effective C1&#8208;symmetric chiral 1,5&#8208;hybrid P,N&#8208;ligands. Importantly, this catalysis platform enables the generic and efficient kinetic resolution of P&#8208;chiral secondary phosphine oxides. It thus provides an expedient approach to access the enantiomers of the P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphine oxides derived from asymmetric hydrophosphinylation, further improving the utility of the method.

Nanoparticles&#8217; uptake by cancer cells upon reaching the tumor microenvironment is often the rate&#8208;limiting step in cancer nanomedicine. Herein, we report that the inclusion of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipids, such as EDTA&#8208; or DTPA&#8208;hexadecylamide lipids in liposome&#8208;like porphyrin nanoparticles (PS) enhanced their intracellular uptake by 25&#8208;fold, which was attributed to these lipids&#8217; ability to fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner rather than by metal chelation of EDTA or DTPA. EDTA&#8208;lipid&#8208;incorporated&#8208;PS (ePS) take advantage of its unique active uptake mechanism to achieve &gt;95&#8201;% photodynamic therapy (PDT) cell killing compared to &lt;5&#8201;% cell killing by PS. In multiple tumor models, ePS demonstrated fast fluorescence&#8208;enabled tumor delineation within minutes post&#8208;injection and increased PDT potency (100&#8201;% survival rate) compared to PS (60&#8201;%). This study offers a new nanoparticle cellular uptake strategy to overcome challenges associated with conventional drug delivery.

&lt;p&gt;We herein report a novel aminopolycarboxylic acid lipid-embedded porphyrin nanoparticle and elucidated its unique cellular delivery mechanism that affords its enhanced intracellular uptake, fast fluorescence activation, and superior photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) efficacy. By exploiting this enhanced delivery strategy, we might overcome challenges associated with intracellular drug delivery to advance therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, diverse dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides, which are important but difficult to access, were successfully prepared on a large scale from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.







Abstract
Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures in living organisms. However, most of the dTDP&#8208;sugars are difficult to obtain due to synthetic difficulties. The limited availability of dTDP&#8208;sugars has hindered progress in investigating the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and exploring new glycosyltransferases in nature. In this study, based on the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, a variety of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides were successfully prepared in high yields and on a large scale from readily available starting materials. The produced sugar nucleotides could provide effective tools for fundamental research in glycoscience.

         <title>ATRP Enhances Structural Correlations In Polymerization&#8208;Induced Phase Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled&#8208;radical polymerization in the solid state is used to induce and arrest the phase separation of highly structurally correlated inclusions. The obtained solid structure is durable and has low size dispersity. It is possible to tune the length scale spontaneously emerging in the system by modifying the synthesis parameters.







Abstract
Synthetic methods to control the structure of materials at sub&#8208;micron scales are typically based on the self&#8208;assembly of structural building blocks with precise size and morphology. On the other hand, many living systems can generate structure across a broad range of length scales in one step directly from macromolecules, using phase separation. Here, we introduce and control structure at the nano&#8208; and microscales through polymerization in the solid state, which has the unusual capability of both triggering and arresting phase separation. In particular, we show that atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) enables control of nucleation, growth, and stabilization of phase&#8208;separated poly&#8208;methylmethacrylate (PMMA) domains in a solid polystyrene (PS) matrix. ATRP yields durable nanostructures with low size dispersity and high degrees of structural correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the length scale of these materials is controlled by the synthesis parameters.

         <title>Transforming Inert Cycloalkanes into &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diamines by Designed Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the production of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines as important nylon monomers was developed, starting from cheap and readily available cycloalkanes. The desired &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines were successfully produced with the highest biosynthesis productivity to date, thus providing an ecologically viable alternative to the current industrial process for manufacturing &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines (DAs) are important monomer precursors that are industrially produced by energy&#8208;intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. Therefore, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs were successfully produced by the designed microbial consortia&#8208;based biocatalytic system. In particular, the highest biosynthesis productivity record of 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine was achieved when using either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane as a substrate. Thus, the developed biocatalytic process provides a promising alternative to the dominant industrial process for manufacturing DAs.

         <dc:description>
Here, we report on label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations (nano&#8208; to picomolar) of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central issue of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities such as cells or mitochondria.







Abstract
Here we report on a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central point of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities. We demonstrate the possibility to record ECL images of cells and mitochondria at concentrations down to nM and pM. This is 7 orders of magnitude lower than classically&#8208;used concentrations and corresponds to a few hundreds of luminophores diffusing around the biological entities. Yet, it produces remarkably sharp negative optical contrast ECL images, as demonstrated by structural similarity index metric analyses and supported by predictions of the ECL image covering time. Finally, we show that the reported approach is a simple, fast, and highly sensitive method, which opens new avenues for ultrasensitive ECL imaging and ECL reactivity at the single molecule level.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Acetylene Enabled by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the regio&#8208; and stereoselective light&#8208;enabled installation of two distinct sulfides into acetylene. The resulting S&#8208;containing vinyl frameworks are important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical data on the mechanism are reported.







Abstract
Although the direct conversion of gaseous acetylene into value&#8208;added liquid commodity chemicals is becoming increasingly attractive, the majority of the established methodologies are focused on cross&#8208;coupling, hydro&#8208;functionalization, and polymerization. Herein, we describe a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization method that inserts acetylene directly into readily available bifunctional reagents. This method provides access to diverse C2&#8208;linked 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;heteroatom products in high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity along with opening up previously unexplored synthetic directions. In addition, we demonstrate this method's synthetic potential by converting the obtained products into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the mechanism for this insertion reaction was investigated.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent findings reported by Gessner and co&#8208;workers in the synthesis of valuable ketenyl anions by an exchange of triphenylphosphine with carbon monoxide at a metaled ylide. The metal ketenyl/ynolate was structurally characterized and used as a reagent in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access in stable form due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access are little investigated. Now, a fundamentally new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block, the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic toolbox of organic synthesis.

         <title>Chemical Validation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Using Fragment Linking and CRISPR Interference
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment screen yielded three series of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphopantetheinyl adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT) ligands that bind to distinct regions within the active site. This presented a unique opportunity for fragment linking that was exploited for the design of higher affinity ligands, shown, using CRISPR interference, to possess on&#8208;target antimycobacterial activity.







Abstract
The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much&#8208;needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Seeking to identify inhibitors of Mtb phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X&#8208;ray crystal structures, we could link weakly&#8208;binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a KD &lt;20&#8197;&#956;M and on&#8208;target anti&#8208;Mtb activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating MtbPPAT as a potential drug target and designing a MtbPPAT&#8208;targeting anti&#8208;TB drug.

         <title>Spontaneous Proton Chemistry Enables Ultralow&#8208;temperature and Long&#8208;life Aqueous Copper Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Benefiting from the excellent thermodynamic stability and low temperature resistance of the electrolyte, the assembled full battery exhibits a extra&#8208;long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous copper metal batteries with acidic electrolytes are regarded as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature energy storage, benefiting from fast kinetics of protons and acid resistance of copper. Here, a Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Systematic studies demonstrate that the hydrolysis of BF4&#8722; generates more protons, rendering the Cu(BF4)2 among the most effective aqueous electrolyte capable of breaking hydrogen bonds in water molecules. This electrolyte endows a polyaniline/Cu battery to deliver a short charging time of 21&#8197;s and a charge/discharge capability of up to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, along with a high discharge specific capacity of 70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a supercapacitor&#8208;comparable power density of 3000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, it can exhibit a long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides an opportunity for intrinsically acidic electrolytes.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Persistent Spin Texture in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement electrically switchable persistent spin texture (PST) in a 2D perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of 2D ferroelectric PST&#8208;active materials for spin manipulation and facilitates high&#8208;performed spintronic device application.







Abstract
As a momentum&#8208;independent spin configuration, persistent spin texture (PST) could avoid spin relaxation and play an advantageous role in spin lifetime. Nevertheless, manipulation of PST is a challenge due to the limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships. Herein, we present electrically switchable PST in a new 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (PA)2CsPb2Br7 (where PA is n&#8208;pentylammonium), which has a high Curie temperature of 349&#8197;K, evident spontaneous polarization (3.2&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low coercive electric field of 5.3&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combination of symmetry&#8208;breaking in ferroelectrics and effective spin&#8208;orbit field facilitates intrinsic PST in the bulk and monolayer structure models. Strikingly, the directions of spin texture are reversible by switching the spontaneous electric polarization. This electric switching behavior relates to the tilting of PbBr6 octahedra and the reorientation of organic PA+ cations. Our studies on ferroelectric PST of 2D hybrid perovskites afford a platform for electrical spin texture manipulation.

         <title>RAFT&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Degradable Waterborne Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene or n&#8208;butyl acrylate was carried out in water to produce block copolymer nanoparticles via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in emulsion. Hydrophilic blocks are either poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) or poly(ethylene glycol), two polymers largely used for their known biocompatibility. The degradability of the hydrophobic core block is ensured by in&#8208;chain cleavable thioester functions.







Abstract
Poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM)&#8208;decorated waterborne nanoparticles comprising a core of either degradable polystyrene (PS) or poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (PBA) were synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in water. A PNAM bearing a trithiocarbonate chain end (PNAM&#8208;TTC) was extended via reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)&#8208;mediated emulsion copolymerization of either styrene (S) or n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA) with dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT). Well&#8208;defined amphiphilic block copolymers were obtained. The in situ self&#8208;assembly of these polymers resulted in the formation of stable nanoparticles. The insertion of thioester units in the vinylic blocks enabled their degradation under basic conditions. The same strategy was then applied to the emulsion copolymerization of BA with DOT using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) equipped with a trithiocarbonate end group, resulting in PEG&#8208;decorated nanoparticles with degradable PBA&#8208;based cores.

Well-defined amphiphilic block copolymers were obtained. The in situ self-assembly of these polymers resulted in the formation of stable nanoparticles. The insertion of thioester units in the vinylic blocks enabled their degradation under basic conditions. The same strategy was then applied to the emulsion copolymerization of BA with DOT using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) equipped with a trithiocarbonate end group, resulting in PEG-decorated nanoparticles with degradable PBA-based cores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitigating Swelling of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase using an Inorganic Anion Switch for Low&#8208;temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inclusion of difluorophosphate anion in the primary solvation sheath of a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte helps to switch the swelling properties of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a graphite (Gr) composite anode. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation was enabled at a stable Gr&#8208;electrolyte interface, contributing to improved low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance of a Li&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
In overcoming the Li+ desolvation barrier for low&#8208;temperature battery operation, a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte based on carboxylate solvent has shown promises. In case of an organic&#8208;anion&#8208;enriched primary solvation sheath (PSS), we found that the electrolyte tends to form a highly swollen, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that shows a high permeability to the electrolyte components, accounting for quickly declined electrochemical performance of graphite&#8208;based anode. Here we proposed a facile strategy to tune the swelling property of SEI by introducing an inorganic anion switch into the PSS, via LiDFP co&#8208;solute method. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI, the electrolyte&#8208;consuming parasitic reactions and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at graphite&#8208;electrolyte interface are suppressed, which contributes to efficient Li+ transport, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation and stable structural evolution of graphite anode in high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Near&#8208;Stoichiometric and Homogenized Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Minimized Performance Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying initialized crystallization and manipulating crystal growth of mixed&#8208;cation alloyed perovskites by pre&#8208;seeding colloidal chemistry realized reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with homogenized chemical compositions and improved optoelectronic properties, delivering a record efficiency up to 24.31&#8201;% for blade&#8208;coated solar cells with minimized performance variation and extended lifespan.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation, small band&#8208;gap perovskites via rationally alloying formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) together have been widely employed for blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells with satisfied efficiencies. One of the stringent challenges lies in difficult control of the nucleation and crystallization kinetics of the perovskites with mixed ingredients. Herein, a pre&#8208;seeding strategy by mixing FAPbI3 solution with pre&#8208;synthesized MAPbI3 microcrystals has been developed to smartly decouple the nucleation and crystallization process. As a result, the time window of initialized crystallization has been greatly extended by 3 folds (i.e. from 5&#8197;s to 20&#8197;s), which enables the formation of uniform and homogeneous alloyed&#8208;FAMA perovskite films with designated stoichiometric ratios. The resultant blade&#8208;coated solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 24.31&#8201;% accompanied by outstanding reproducibility with more than 87&#8201;% of the devices showing efficiencies higher than 23&#8201;%.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING potentiates immunotherapy agents. Using a luminescence&#8208;based cellular assay, we discovered a novel protein&#8208;protein interaction modulator, SB24011, that inhibited the STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction and upregulated cellular STING levels. As a result, SB24011 boosted STING immunity and improved the in vivo efficacy of immunotherapy with a STING agonist and an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody.







Abstract
Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>A Double&#8208;Walled Tetrahedron with AgI4 Vertices Binds Different Guests in Distinct Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise [Ag4X]3+ (X=I, Br, or Cl) clusters have been incorporated at the vertices of a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron. The cage binds guests in two distinct modes: small aromatic guests bind externally, and anionic guests bind in the central cavity. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, with a preference found for the softer halides.







Abstract
A double&#8208;walled tetrahedral metal&#8208;organic cage assembled in solution from silver(I), 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, halide, and a threefold&#8208;symmetric triamine. The AgI4X clusters at its vertices each bring together six naphthyridine&#8208;imine moieties, leading to a structure in which eight tritopic ligands bridge four clusters in an (AgI4X)4L8 arrangement. Four ligands form an inner set of tetrahedron walls that are surrounded by the outer four. The cage has significant interior volume, and was observed to bind anionic guests.

     alt="A Double-Walled Tetrahedron with AgI4 Vertices Binds Different Guests in Distinct Sites**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise [Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (X=I, Br, or Cl) clusters have been incorporated at the vertices of a double-walled tetrahedron. The cage binds guests in two distinct modes: small aromatic guests bind externally, and anionic guests bind in the central cavity. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well-defined hierarchy, with a preference found for the softer halides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double-walled tetrahedral metal-organic cage assembled in solution from silver(I), 2-formyl-1,8-naphthyridine, halide, and a threefold-symmetric triamine. The Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X clusters at its vertices each bring together six naphthyridine-imine moieties, leading to a structure in which eight tritopic ligands bridge four clusters in an (Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; arrangement. Four ligands form an inner set of tetrahedron walls that are surrounded by the outer four. The cage has significant interior volume, and was observed to bind anionic guests. The structure also possesses external binding clefts, located at the edges of the cage, which bound small aromatic guests. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well-defined hierarchy, allowing modulation of the cavity volume. The principles uncovered here may allow for increasingly more sophisticated cages with silver-cluster vertex architectures, with post-assembly tuning of the interior cavity volume enabling targeted binding behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State THz Vibrations in Aggregates of PtII Complexes Contribute to the Enhancement of Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Efficiencies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aggregate PtII complexes exhibits low&#8208;frequency (THz) excited&#8208;state vibrations measured by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy. These significant low&#8208;frequency vibronic displacements suppress non&#8208;radiative decay and enhance near&#8208;infrared emission efficiencies.







Abstract
The exploration of deactivation mechanisms for near&#8208;infrared(NIR)&#8208;emissive organic molecules has been a key issue in chemistry, materials science and molecular biology. In this study, based on transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the aggregated PtII complex 4H (efficient NIR emitter) exhibits collective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with a frequency of 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.96&#8197;THz) in the excited states. Importantly, similar THz characteristics were also observed in analogous PtII complexes with prominent NIR emission efficiency. The conservation of THz motions enables excited&#8208;state deactivation to proceed along low&#8208;frequency vibrational coordinates, contributing to the suppression of nonradiative decay and remarkable NIR emission. These novel results highlight the significance of excited&#8208;state vibrations in nonradiative processes, which serve as a benchmark for improving device performance.

         <title>Influencing Factors on Li&#8208;ion Conductivity and Interfacial Stability of Solid Polymer Electrolytes, Exampled by Polycarbonates, Polyoxalates and Polymalonates</title>

         <dc:description>
Three families of ester&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes consisting of polycarbonate, polyoxalate and polymalonate were prepared and investigated on their Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidation ability. The performances of solid polymer electrolytes are affected by the coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F.







Abstract
The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) batteries is hindered by lower Li+&#8208;conductivity and narrower electrochemical window. Here, three families of ester&#8208;based F&#8208;modified SPEs of poly&#8208;carbonate (PCE), poly&#8208;oxalate (POE) and poly&#8208;malonate (PME) were investigated. The Li+&#8208;conductivity of these SPEs prepared from pentanediol are all higher than the counterparts made of butanediol, owing to the enhanced asymmetry and flexibility. Because of stronger chelating coordination with Li+, the Li+&#8208;conductivity of PME and POE is around 10 and 5&#8197;times of PCE. The trifluoroacetyl&#8208;units are observed more effective than &#8722;O&#8722;CH2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CH2&#8722;O&#8722; during the in situ passivation of Li&#8208;metal. Using trifluoroacetyl terminated POE and PCE as SPE, the interfaces with Li&#8208;metal and high&#8208;voltage&#8208;cathode are stabilized simultaneously, endowing stable cycling of ASS Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells. Owing to an enol isomerization of malonate, the cycling stability of Li/PME/NCM622 is deteriorated, which is recovered with the introduce of dimethyl&#8208;group in malonate and the suppression of enol isomerization. The coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F, are all critical for the molecular design of SPEs.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Design of Chain&#8208;Growth Click Polymerization Based on a Thiol&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization has been developed that can proceed quickly under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the Michael addition controls the kinetics of the propagation process. In addition, this new polymerization can be spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, and the resulting polymers can be directly used for polymer ligations.







Abstract
The development of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization is challenging yet desirable in modern polymer chemistry. In this work, we reported a novel chain&#8208;growth click polymerization based on the thiol&#8208;Michael reaction. This polymerization could be performed efficiently under ambient conditions and spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, allowing the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers in excellent yields and high molecular weights. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the thiolate addition to the Michael acceptor is the rate&#8208;determining step, and introducing the phenyl group could facilitate the chain&#8208;growth process. This polymerization is a new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization, which will provide a unique approach to creating functional polymers.

         <title>Atomic Structural Origin of Fictive Temperature Revealed by AZnP3O9 (A=K, Rb) Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new evaluation method is provided to judge the glass stability and glass&#8208;forming ability. As an example, the reported novel glass KZnP3O9 exhibits the highest &#948; (&#948;=1, nglass=8) that quantitatively identifies the short&#8208;range order similarity to its crystalline counterpart. The inverse &#948;&#8208;Tf correlation gives the direct evidence for the structural origin of fictive temperature revealing the relaxation thermodynamics.







Abstract
The fictive temperature (Tf) is widely applied to understand the relaxation thermodynamics of a glass; however, its atomic structural origin is still unclear. Here, we report two novel AZnP3O9 glasses obtained by melting the composition identical single crystals. These glasses exhibit structural inheritance within 5&#8197;&#197; from the single crystal counterparts that is quantified by &#948;=nglass/ncry (0&#8804;&#948;&#8804;1, n is the number of pair correlation functions). Among the available glass&#8208;formers, glassKZnP3O9 exhibits the highest structural inheritance (&#948;=1, nglass=8). More insightfully, a reverse correlation between &#948; and the relaxation thermodynamic parameters is observed in glassAZnP3O9, revealing for the first time the atomic structural origin of fictive temperature.

         <title>Ring Expansion Strategies for the Synthesis of Medium Sized Ring and Macrocyclic Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods proceed without using classical protecting groups, initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively, to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions is in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
Two new ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized ring and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods can be performed without using classical protecting groups, with the key ring expansion step initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively. Each method can be used to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in good to excellent yields, in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions is in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Based on AIEgen&#8208;Mediated Polyelectrolyte Assemblies for Manipulating Intramolecular Motion and Magnetic Relaxivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we break the bottleneck of uncontrollable inner microenvironment from the hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy, and present a fluorescent probe based AIEgen&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy. By modulating a &#8220;soft&#8221; and water&#8208;rich inner microenvironment in nanotheranostics, APN strategy has for the first time synergistically manipulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity.







Abstract
Uniting photothermal therapy (PTT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds great potential in nanotheranostics. However, the extensively utilized hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy not only restricts the intramolecular motion&#8208;induced PTT, but also blocks the interactions between MR agents and water. Herein, we report an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy, which bestows a unique &#8220;soft&#8221; inner microenvironment with good water permeability. Femtosecond transient spectra verify that APN well activates intramolecular motion from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. This de novo APN strategy uniting synergistically three factors (rotational motion, local motion, and hydration number) brings out high MR relaxivity. For the first time, APN strategy has successfully modulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity, achieving fluorescence lifetime imaging of tumor spheroids and spatio&#8208;temporal MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;efficient PTT.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Environment&#8208;Dependent Photoresponsive Oxidase&#8208;Like Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were used to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase. It is shown by constructing isostructural HOFs that the pore environments play an important role in mediating the oxidase&#8208;like activity. The enzyme&#8208;like activity of the HOFs is associated with the substrate&#8208;pore interaction, reminiscent of the binding effect of the native enzyme pocket.







Abstract
Mimicking the bioactivity of native enzymes through synthetic chemistry is an efficient means to advance the biocatalysts in a cell&#8208;free environment, however, remains long&#8208;standing challenges. Herein, we utilize structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase, and uncover the important role of pore environments on mediating oxidase&#8208;like activity by means of constructing isostructural HOFs. We discover that the HOF pore with suitable geometry can stabilize and spatially organize the catalytic substrate into a favorable catalytic route, as with the function of the native enzyme pocket. Based on the desirable photo&#8208;responsive oxidase&#8208;like activity, a visual and sensitive HOFs biosensor is established for the detection of phosphatase, an important biomarker of skeletal and hepatobiliary diseases. This work demonstrates that the pore environments significantly influence the nanozymes&#8217; activity in addition to the active center.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Mutaxanthene Unveils a Flavoprotein Monooxygenase Catalyzing Xanthene Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aromatic polyketide containing a xanthene framework and belonging to the mutaxanthene family was discovered through genome mining. The total biosynthesis of this natural product was successfully accomplished using 14 reconstituted enzymes, revealing that a flavoprotein monooxygenase catalyzes a key ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases (FPMOs) play important roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in natural products biosynthesized by type&#8197;II polyketide synthases (PKSs). In this study, we used genome mining to discover novel mutaxanthene analogues and investigated the biosynthesis of these aromatic polyketides and their unusual xanthene framework. We determined the complete biosynthetic pathway of mutaxathene through in vivo gene deletion and in vitro biochemical experiments. We show that a multifunctional FPMO, MtxO4, catalyzes ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation. In addition, we successfully obtained all necessary enzymes for in vitro reconstitution and completed the total biosynthesis of mutaxanthene in a stepwise manner. Our results revealed the formation of a rare xanthene ring in type&#8197;II polyketide biosynthesis, and demonstrate the potential of using total biosynthesis for the discovery of natural products synthesized by type&#8197;II PKSs.

         <title>Engineering a Copper Single&#8208;Atom Electron Bridge to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) were constructed at the contact interface between Cu1/MoS2 and MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 to achieve a highly active and stable catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. Empowered by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S SAEB species, the Z&#8208;Scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was significantly promoted, leading to enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a great challenge. We designed a Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst with N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S single&#8208;atom electron bridge (denoted as Cu&#8208;SAEB), which was used to mediate the CO2RR. The production of CO and O2 over Cu&#8208;SAEB is as high as 236.0 and 120.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents, respectively, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts. Notably, the as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 reaction cycles, totaling 300&#8197;h, owing to the strengthened contact interface of Cu&#8208;SAEB, and mediated by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z&#8208;scheme interfacial charge&#8208;transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR of Cu&#8208;SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential in CO2 conversion applications.

Notably, the as-designed Cu-SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 reaction cycles, totaling 300&#8197;h, owing to the strengthened contact interface of Cu-SAEB, and mediated by the N&#8722;Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z-scheme interfacial charge-transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of the photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR of Cu-SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Compound I Mimic Reveals the Transient Active Species of a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme: Insight into the Stereoselectivity of P450&#8208;Catalysed Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining snapshots of cytochrome P450s with their substrates in catalytically relevant poses has been a longstanding challenge. By exploiting the properties of a synthetic porphyrin that closely mimics the highly unstable P450 active species, styrene could be captured in poses that align with the experimental evidence. This approach shows great promise as a tool in the targeted design of more efficient P450 biocatalysts.







Abstract
Catching the structure of cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd&#8201;I, a short&#8208;lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This structure was attained by incorporation of the stable Cpd&#8201;I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo&#8208;oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in the rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd&#8201;I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.

         <title>Triggered Functional Dynamics of AsLOV2 by Time&#8208;Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance at High Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We took advantage of site&#8208;directed spin labeling of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN to track qualitative mechanical movement in the protein AsLOV2. Experiments were done in vitro at room temperature, allowing us to elucidate mutation&#8208;induced inhibited refolding of the J&#945;&#8208;helix.







Abstract
We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8722;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240&#8197;GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein's mechanical cycle in the solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7/2 EPR&#8208;active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6&#8197;T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C&#8208;terminus and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1&#8197;s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60&#8197;s. TiGGER revealed that the light&#8208;activated long&#8208;range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.

         <title>Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of light&#8208;driven rotary motors in polymer networks leads to active hydrogels that can be engineered as macroscopic bending actuators. In this configuration, lifting experiments reveal that a single molecular motor can pick up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.







Abstract
The unidirectional rotation of chemically crosslinked light&#8208;driven molecular motors is shown to progressively shift the swelling equilibrium of hydrogels. The concentration of molecular motors and the initial strand density of the polymer network are key parameters to modulate the macroscopic contraction of the material, and both parameters can be tuned using polymer chains of different molecular weights. These findings led to the design of optimized hydrogels revealing a half&#8208;time contraction of approximately 5&#8197;min. Furthermore, under inhomogeneous stimulation, the local contraction event was exploited to design useful bending actuators with an energy output 400 times higher than for previously reported self&#8208;assembled systems involving rotary motors. In the present configuration, we measure that a single molecular motor can lift up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Formal Double C&#8722;H Oxidation of Prenylated Molecules to Alkylidene Oxetanes and Azetidines by Strain&#8208;Enabled Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol has been developed that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis protocol allows the efficient coupling of highly substituted and electron&#8208;rich olefins.







Abstract
Prenylation is a ubiquitous late&#8208;stage modification in nature that often confers significantly improved bioactivity for secondary metabolites. While this lipophilic modification renders enhanced potency, the lipophilic tag(s) can diminish bioavailability and adversely alter drug transportation and metabolism. Thus, a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, and selective late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of prenyl tags would present a great potential in drug discovery programs but could also impact other fields, such as agrochemistry and chemical biology. Herein we report an exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of prenyl tags, a formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol, that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This methodology avoids the need for prefunctionalization of target molecules and affords ready access to an unprecedented library of oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;prenylated complex molecules. Thus, in a broader context, this methodology extends late&#8208;stage functionalization beyond that available to nature.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Nitric Oxide&#8208;Responsive Nanosensor for Photoacoustic Imaging in the SWIR Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of new SWIR dyes based on the xanthene core was synthesized using C&#8722;H activation chemistry. We showcased the biomedical utility of these imaging agents by selecting one example for the development of a ratiometric nanosensor, which we employed to detect elevated levels of nitric oxide in a murine model of drug&#8208;induced liver injury via SWIR PA imaging.







Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400&#8197;nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near&#8208;infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (SCR&#8208;1), thienothiophene (SCR&#8208;2), or bithiophene (SCR&#8208;3). We leverage the fact that SCR&#8208;1 undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (rNP&#8208;NO), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug&#8208;induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.

&lt;p&gt;A panel of new SWIR dyes based on the xanthene core was synthesized using C&#8722;H activation chemistry. We showcased the biomedical utility of these imaging agents by selecting one example for the development of a ratiometric nanosensor, which we employed to detect elevated levels of nitric oxide in a murine model of drug-induced liver injury via SWIR PA imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400&#8197;nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near-infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (&lt;b&gt;SCR-1&lt;/b&gt;), thienothiophene (&lt;b&gt;SCR-2&lt;/b&gt;), or bithiophene (&lt;b&gt;SCR-3&lt;/b&gt;). We leverage the fact that &lt;b&gt;SCR-1&lt;/b&gt; undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (&lt;b&gt;rNP-NO&lt;/b&gt;), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug-induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Lone Pair Expression as Chemical Bonding Origin of Giant Phonon Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For thermoelectric InTe, we reveal dynamic lone&#8208;pair expression as the chemical&#8208;bonding origin of giant phonon anharmonicity and intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Our study provides a first detailed microscopic picture connecting dynamical chemical bonding with giant phonon anharmonicity and ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
Loosely bonded (&#8220;rattling&#8221;) atoms with s2 lone pair electrons are usually associated with strong anharmonicity and unexpectedly low thermal conductivity, yet their detailed correlation remains largely unknown. Here we resolve this correlation in thermoelectric InTe by combining chemical bonding analysis, inelastic X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, and first principles phonon calculations. We successfully probe soft low&#8208;lying transverse phonons dominated by large In1+ z&#8208;axis motions, and their giant anharmonicity. We show that the highly anharmonic phonons arise from the dynamic lone pair expression with unstable occupied antibonding states induced by the covalency between delocalized In1+ 5s2 lone pair electrons and Te 5p states. This work pinpoints the microscopic origin of strong anharmonicity driven by rattling atoms with stereochemical lone pair activity, important for designing efficient materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.

         <title>Sterically Hindered and Deconjugative &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Asymmetric Mannich Reaction of Meinwald Rearrangement&#8208;Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered and deconjugative &#945;&#8208;regioselective asymmetric Mannich reaction of Meinwald rearrangement&#8208;intermediates was realized by using chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ ScIII catalysts, offering chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and alcohols in high efficiency. Experimental and computational studies showed that the steric hindrance of the ligand and the protecting group on the imine are critical factors influencing the &#945;/&#947;&#8208;regioselectivity.







Abstract
Compared to &#947;&#8208;addition, the &#945;&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes faces larger steric hindrance and disrupts the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, which might be why very few examples are reported. In this article, a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective &#945;&#8208;regioselective Mannich reaction of isatin&#8208;derived ketimines with &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, generated in situ from Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides, is realized by using chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII catalysts. A series of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and homoallylic alcohols with vicinal multisubstituted stereocenters are constructed in excellent yields, good d.r. and excellent ee values. Experimental studies and DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal that the large steric hindrance of the ligand and the Boc (tButyloxy carbonyl) protecting group of imines are critical factors for the &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity.

         <title>Structural Determination and Chemical Synthesis of the N&#8208;Glycan from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of an N&#8208;glycan from the hyper&#8208;thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis are reported. The identified N&#8208;glycan possesses a highly glycosylated myo&#8208;inositol moiety, which is linked to a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. Although myo&#8208;inositol is ubiquitous in archaea and eukaryotes, inositol&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycans were unknown until now.







Abstract
Asparagine&#8208;linked protein glycosylations (N&#8208;glycosylations) are one of the most abundant post&#8208;translational modifications and are essential for various biological phenomena. Herein, we describe the isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of the N&#8208;glycan from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The N&#8208;glycan from the organism possesses a unique structure including myo&#8208;inositol, which has not been found in previously characterized N&#8208;glycans. In this structure, myo&#8208;inositol is highly glycosylated and linked with a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. The straightforward synthesis of this glycan was accomplished through diastereoselective phosphorylation and phosphodiester construction by SN2 coupling. Considering the early divergence of hyperthermophilic organisms in evolution, this study can be expected to open the door to approaching the primitive function of glycan modification at the molecular level.

         <title>Surface Engineering Stabilizes Rhombohedral Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrates for High&#8208;Energy Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate full&#8208;cell configurations show comparable energy density to that of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 full cells.







Abstract
The rhombohedral sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) only containing cheap Fe and Mn metals was regarded as a scalable, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy cathode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unexpected Jahn&#8208;teller effect and significant phase transformation would cause Mn dissolution and anisotropic volume change, thus leading to capacity loss and structural instability. Here we report a simple room&#8208;temperature route to construct a magical CoxB skin on the surface of MnHCF. Benefited from the complete coverage and the buffer effect of CoxB layer, the modified MnHCF cathode exhibits suppressed Mn dissolution and reduced intergranular cracks inside particles, thereby demonstrating thousands&#8208;cycle level cycling lifespan. By comparing two key parameters in the real energy world, i.e., cost per kilowatt&#8208;hours and cost per cycle&#8208;life, our developed CoxB coated MnHCF cathode demonstrates more competitive application potential than the benchmarking LiFePO4 for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Discovery of Norbornene as a Novel Hydrophobic Tag Applied in Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel norbornene&#8208;based hydrophobic tag was developed that expands the clinical potential of targeted protein degradation technologies. The degrader Hyt&#8208;9, which was obtained by connecting an ALK ligand with norbornene, exhibited potent antiproliferative and degradative activities in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, norbornene could be used to degrade EZH2 when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in degrader Hyt&#8208;13.







Abstract
Hydrophobic tagging (HyT) is a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). Norbornene was discovered as an unprecedented hydrophobic tag in this study and was used to degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein by linking it to ALK inhibitors. The most promising degrader, Hyt&#8208;9, potently reduced ALK levels through Hsp70 and the ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome system (UPS) in vitro without compensatory upregulation of ALK. Furthermore, Hyt&#8208;9 exhibited a significant tumor&#8208;inhibiting effect in vivo with moderate oral bioavailability. More importantly, norbornene can also be used to degrade the intractable enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Thus, the discovery of novel hydrophobic norbornene tags shows promise for the future development of TPD technology.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Bisacridine Donor Enables Fast Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bisacridine donor enables both quasi&#8208;equatorial and quasi&#8208;axial geometries in TADF emitter, ensuring an efficient reversed intersystem crossing and an enhanced radiative decay, which results in high&#8208;performance OLEDs.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously is of great significance for further application of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. A balance between radiative decay and reversed intersystem crossing must be carefully established. Herein, we propose a qunolino&#8208;acridine (QAc) donor composing two acridine with both planar (pAc) and bended (bAc) geometries. Combining with triazine, a TADF emitter QAc&#8208;TRZ is assembled. The pAc provides a well interaction with triazine which ensures a decent TADF behavior, while the bAc offers a delocalization of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) which guarantees an enhancement of radiative decay. Remarkably, QAc&#8208;TRZ enables a highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%. More importantly, the efficiencies under 100/1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 stay 36.3&#8201;% and 31.7&#8201;%, respectively, and remain 21.5&#8201;% even under 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Record Ultralarge&#8208;Pores, Low Density Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Controlled Drug Delivery
</title>

Record ultralarge&#8208;pores (47&#8197;&#197;), low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) three&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, TUS&#8208;64, was obtained by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. TUS&#8208;64 displayed the significant qualities of a drug delivery vehicle: controlled release kinetics, sustained delivery, and site&#8208;specific targeting.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) like high surface areas, interconnected pore system and readily accessible active sites render them promising platforms for a wide set of functional applications. Albeit promising, the reticular construction of 3D COFs with large pores is a very demanding task owing to the formation of interpenetrated frameworks. Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, namely TUS&#8208;64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47&#8197;&#197;) and record&#8208;low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS&#8208;64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS&#8208;64 as drug nanocarriers.

         <title>Tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles: Straightforward Access to Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Polyaromatics from s&#8208;Tetrazines</title>

         <dc:description>
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported starting from fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.







Abstract
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported. Starting from readily available fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine, a cyclization process with azide leads to the formation of an unprecedented tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole or a bis&#8208;tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole (cis and trans conformers). Based on the new nitrogen core, further N&#8208;directed palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization allows the introduction of halides or acetates. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied by a joint experimental/theoretical approach. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared, and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.

         <title>Understanding Synergistic Catalysis on Cu&#8208;Se Dual Atom Sites via Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxygen reduction reaction that occurrs on the Cu1&#8208;N4 and Se1&#8208;C3 dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom sites is revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy under realistic Zn&#8208;air battery conditions, in which OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) obtains one electron and is further transformed into the O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate.







Abstract
The construction and understanding of synergy in well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom active sites is an available avenue to promote multistep tandem catalytic reactions. Herein, we construct a dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom catalyst that comprises adjacent Cu&#8208;N4 and Se&#8208;C3 active sites for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations provide in&#8208;depth insights into this dual&#8208;atom synergy mechanism for ORR under realistic device operation conditions. The heteroatom Se modulator can efficiently polarize the charge distribution around symmetrical Cu&#8208;N4 moieties, and serve as synergistic site to facilitate the second oxygen reduction step simultaneously, in which the key OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate on the dual&#8208;atom sites. Therefore, this designed catalyst achieves satisfied alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.905&#8197;V vs. RHE and a maximum power density of 206.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>A Practical and Robust Zwitterionic Cooperative Lewis Acid/Acetate/Benzimidazolium Catalyst for Direct 1,4&#8208;Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular cooperation of CuII, coordinated acetate and a benzimidazolium unit in the catalyst periphery allows for unprecedented catalyst productivity and high stereocontrol in direct 1,4&#8208;additions to maleimides and a number of other Michael acceptors. Next to the sophisticated activation principle, the catalyst is readily prepared and has robust reactivity. Moreover, it is shown to be reusable multiple times.







Abstract
A catalyst type is disclosed allowing for exceptional efficiency in direct 1,4&#8208;additions. The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to CuII, which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor &gt;300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N&#8208;Ph&#8208;benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96&#8201;% and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate/acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.

         <title>Amphoteric Cellulose&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Electrolyte Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a flexible amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte. The amphoteric groups not only promoted the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions, but also guided the Zn2+ deposition to inhibit dendrite growth, thus resulting in a ultra&#8208;stable Zn anode.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal anode suffers from uncontrollable Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions at the interface, which restrict the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs). Herein, an amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network is introduced as hydrogel electrolyte to overcome these obstacles. On one hand, the amphoteric groups build anion/cation transport channels to regulate electro&#8208;deposition behavior on Zn (002) crystal plane enabled by homogenizing Zn2+ ions flux. On the other hand, the strong bonding between negatively charged carboxyl groups and Zn2+ ions promote the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions. Based on the above two functions, the hydrogel electrolyte enables an ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 7&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn cell. This work provides significant concepts for developing hydrogel electrolytes to realize stable anode for high&#8208;performance ARZBs.

         <title>Dredging the Charge&#8208;Carrier Transfer Pathway for Efficient Low&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (GABA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=1, 2, 3, 4, MA+=CH3NH3+) with inhibited dielectric confinement were constructed with &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the spacer cation. The hydrogen bonds&#160;between the spacers link the adjacent spacing sheets, enabling the charges localized in the van der Waals gap. The power conversion efficiency of (GABA)2MA4Pb5I16 solar cells with excellent carrier transport properties is up to 18.73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (LDRP) perovskites still suffer from inferior carrier transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer can be achieved in LDRP perovskite by introducing &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a spacer. The hydrogen bonding links adjacent spacing sheets in (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 (MA=CH3NH3+), leading to the charges localized in the van der Waals gap, thereby constructing &#8220;charged&#8208;bridge&#8221; for charge transfer through the spacing region. Additionally, the polarized GABA weakens dielectric confinement, decreasing the (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 exciton binding energy as low as &#8776;73&#8197;meV. Benefiting from these merits, the resultant GABA&#8208;based solar cell yields a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.73&#8201;% with enhanced carrier transport properties. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintains 92.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE under continuous illumination after 1000&#8197;h and only lost 3&#8201;% of its initial PCE under 65&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase activity of a dual&#8208;functional small&#8208;molecule (DFSM)&#8208;facilitated P450BM3&#8208;H2O2 system was drastically improved through mechanism&#8208;guided protein engineering for the P450&#8208;mediated direct nitration of phenols, anilines, and styrenes using nitrite as the nitrating agent. Co&#8208;crystal structures revealed the crucial role of the steric effect introduced by site&#8208;directed mutations of proximal residues in the regulation of substrate access.







Abstract
Applications of the peroxidase activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present herein a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for the direct nitration of aromatic compounds and terminal aryl&#8208;substituted olefins in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active&#8208;site residues allowed the efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease in monooxygenation activity and increase in peroxidase activity. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. Besides direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent, we also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;The peroxidase activity of a dual-functional small-molecule (DFSM)-facilitated P450BM3-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system was drastically improved through mechanism-guided protein engineering for the P450-mediated direct nitration of phenols, anilines, and styrenes using nitrite as the nitrating agent. Co-crystal structures revealed the crucial role of the steric effect introduced by site-directed mutations of proximal residues in the regulation of substrate access.

         <title>Visible Helicity Induction and Memory in Polyallene toward Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Helicity Discrimination, and Enantiomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of racemic polymers were induced into one&#8208;handed helices which were memorized after the chiral inducer was removed. The enantiomeric excess of one handed helix (eeh) is up to 98&#8201;%. Interestingly, the switchable helix&#8208;induction is visible with the naked eye. Moreover, the one&#8208;handed helices exhibit enhanced stability with helicity discrimination and enantiomer separation abilities.







Abstract
Inspired by biological helices (e.g., DNA), artificial helical polymers have attracted intense attention. However, precise synthesis of one&#8208;handed helices from achiral materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of achiral poly(biphenyl allene)s with controlled molar mass and low dispersity were prepared and induced into one&#8208;handed helices using chiral amines and alcohols. The induced one&#8208;handed helix was simultaneously memorized, even after the chiral inducer was removed. The switchable induction processes were visible to naked eye; the achiral polymers exhibited blue emission (irradiated at 365&#8197;nm), whereas the induced one&#8208;handed helices exhibited cyan emission with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The induced helices formed stable gels in various solvents with helicity discrimination ability: the same&#8208;handed helix gels were self&#8208;healing, whereas the gels of opposite&#8208;handed helicity were self&#8208;sorted. Moreover, the induced helices could separate enantiomers via enantioselective crystallization with high efficiency and switchable enantioselectivity.

         <title>Simultaneous co&#8208;Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Ethanol Oxidation towards Synergistic Acetaldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox system that can simultaneous use photoinduced electrons and holes for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled with selective ethanol oxidation to one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product is realized on Rb and K co&#8208;modified carbon nitride catalyst, with a benchmark C2 product yield and near&#8208;ideal atomic economy.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 is of great interest but it often suffers sluggish oxidation half reaction and undesired by&#8208;products. Here, we report for the first the simultaneous co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction and ethanol oxidation towards one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product on a rubidium and potassium co&#8208;modified carbon nitride (CN&#8208;KRb). The CN&#8208;KRb offers a record photocatalytic activity of 1212.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% for CH3CHO production, outperforming all the state&#8208;of&#8208;art CO2 photocatalysts. It is disclosed that the introduced Rb boosts the *OHCCHO fromation and facilitates the CH3CHO desorption, while K promotes ethanol adsorption and activation. Moreover, the H+ stemming from ethanol oxidation is confirmed to participate in the CO2 reduction process, endowing near ideal overall atomic economy. This work provides a new strategy for effective use of the photoexcited electron and hole for high selective and sustainable conversion of CO2 paired with oxidation reaction into identical product.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Radical 1,2&#8208;Carbophosphonylation of Styrenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes from readily available alkyl halides and dialkyl phosphites is developed. The key to the success of the strategy lies in not only the proper choice of phosphorus reagents to suppress the reverse chemoselectivity but also the utilization of a chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8722;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8722;H&#8208;type reagent and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic superstructures are designed, which empower high&#8208;kinetics Grotthuss proton conduction to deeply access built&#8208;in protophilic oxygen motifs via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron (de)coordination reaction, endowing the assembled Zn&#8208;organic battery ultrahigh energy density, superior rate capacity and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability.







Abstract
With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09&#8197;eV vs. 0.25&#8197;eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 150&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), high energy density (267&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.

Then, high-kinetics H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination is prior to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into protophilic C=O sites via a two-step nine-electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high-rate capability (135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 150&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high energy density (267&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cathode&lt;/sub&gt;) and ultra-long life (50&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), becoming the state-of-the-art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived plasmonic Cu catalyst was synthesized for the photo&#8208;driven water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Light&#8208;induced hot electrons led to efficient *H2O activation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway. High hydrogen production rate (114.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) was realized at 200&#8201;&#176;C through the plasmonic Cu&#8208;mediated strategy, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for (photo&#8208;)thermal WGSR catalyst at low temperatures.







Abstract
The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV/Vis irradiation (1.4&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) having a special coordination with substrate C and O atoms was designed. This unique structure could induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and thus the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance. As a result, the obtained Sn ADPs displayed an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity stability, and durability in the NRR.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N2 reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N2 adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH3 yield (RNH3) of 28.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (7447&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgSn&#8722;1) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the enhanced N2Hx intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N2 fixation.

         <title>Directed Asymmetric Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Electronically Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly diastereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes was developed. Additionally, the enantioselective variant with unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes was also achieved, delivering various polyarylalkanes bearing benzylic stereocenters with good to high enantioselectivities and excellent diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diarylation of electronically unactivated alkenes has emerged as an extensive research topic in organic synthesis. However, most examples are mainly limited to terminal alkenes. Furthermore, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated alkenes still remains unsolved and is a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a highly efficient directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes with high diastereoselectivities. More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni&#8208;catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;like Sulfur&#8208;Containing Plastics from Sustainable Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new family of chemically recyclable polymers in a large scale from the sustainable monomers H2O, COS, and diacrylates. Such resultant polymers manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to commodity polyethylene. The chemical recycling of these polymers can be readily achieved through two closed loops.







Abstract
The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.

A globally robust HOF with both rigidity and flexibility was constructed. The non&#8208;crystalline and crystalline phases of the HOF could be easily and reversibly switched at will with the specific solvent molecule. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
A weak CH/O hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with both rigidity and flexibility that could easily and reversibly switch from a non&#8208;crystalline to a crystalline phase was constructed. The specific solvent molecule acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the highly rigid triangle macrocycle as the building block is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; could influence the local flexibility of the whole framework and lead to switchable crystallinity. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).

         <title>Towards Axially Chiral Pyrazole&#8208;Based Phosphorus Scaffolds by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective reaction has been developed for the construction of axially chiral arylpyrazole skeletons with phosphorus unit. The reaction proceeds through a sequential Huisgen&#8208;type cycloaddition/aromatization process with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion using a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt catalyst. Arylpyrazole&#8208;based atropisomeric phosphorus compounds are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Given the comparatively lower rotational barriers, the catalytic asymmetric construction of axially chiral biaryl structures, especially those containing a five&#8208;membered heterocycle, still remains a challenge. Herein, we described a general and modular protocol to access atropisomeric arylpyrazole scaffolds containing a phosphorus unit by a dipeptide phosphonium salt catalyzed reaction involving an oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. This reaction features excellent yields and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and a low catalyst loading, delivering axially chiral phosphine compounds.

         <title>Alloying&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of NiFe System via Laser&#8208;Assisted Al Incorporation for Full Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;standing hybrid system consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum incorporation on nickel foam (NF) for full water splitting. Ni18Fe12Al70 (Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe) delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger HER and OER processes with better performance than individual Ni60Fe40 (Ni3Fe phase) and individual Ni30Al70 (Ni2Al3 phase), allowing a design strategy of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.







Abstract
It is challenging to design one non&#8208;noble material with balanced bifunctional performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for commercial sustainability at a low cost since the different electrocatalytic mechanisms are not easily matchable for each other. Herein, a self&#8208;standing hybrid system Ni18Fe12Al70, consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases, was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum (Al) incorporation towards full water splitting. It was found that the incorporation of Al could effectively tune the morphologies, compositions and phases. The results indicate that Ni18Fe12Al70 delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger both HER (&#951;100=188&#8197;mV) and OER (&#951;100=345&#8197;mV) processes and maintains a stable overpotential for 100&#8197;h, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe alloys on the HER process is confirmed based on theoretical calculation.

         <title>Chemical Enhancement and Quenching in Single&#8208;Molecule Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;molecule point contact can dramatically increase the molecular tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) signal via a combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism induced by the ground&#8208;state charge transfer (GSCT). In contrast, the TERS signal from a planar molecule chemisorbed flatly on the silver substrate is significantly quenched, mainly due to the polarizability screening induced by the interfacial dynamic charge transfer (IDCT).







Abstract
Despite intensive research in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the influence mechanism of chemical effects on Raman signals remains elusive. Here, we investigate such chemical effects through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) of a single planar ZnPc molecule with varying but controlled contact environments. TERS signals are found dramatically enhanced upon making a tip&#8211;molecule point contact. A combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism is proposed to explain such an enhancement via the generation of a ground&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer induced vertical Raman polarizability that is further enhanced by the strong vertical plasmonic field in the nanocavity. In contrast, TERS signals from ZnPc chemisorbed flatly on substrates are found strongly quenched, which is rationalized by the Raman polarizability screening effect induced by interfacial dynamic charge transfer. Our results provide deep insights into the understanding of the chemical effects in TERS/SERS enhancement and quenching.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadiene and Methylcyclopentadiene with Xylose or Extracted Hemicellulose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly integrated two&#8208;step strategy was developed for the selective synthesis of renewable cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) with xylose or the hemicelluloses extracted from real biomass. Compared with the conventional fossil route, the new synthetic strategy has evident advantages in the renewability and higher availability of feedstock.







Abstract
Cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) are important intermediates that have been widely used in the production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rocket fuels, polymers and valuable chemicals. Currently, CPD and MCPD are produced from fossil energies at very low yields, which greatly limits their application. As a solution to this problem, we disclose an alternative two&#8208;step bio&#8208;route to access CPD and MCPD using xylose or extracted hemicellulose as the feedstock. In the first step, cyclopentanone (CPO) was directly produced by the selective hydrogenolysis of xylose or extracted hemicellulose over a commercial Ru/C catalyst in an acid&#8208;free toluene/NaCl aqueous solution biphasic system. In the second step, CPO was selectively converted to CPD by a cascade hydrodeoxygenation/dehydrogenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts. When methanol was introduced with CPO and hydrogen, MCPD was selectively obtained by a cascade dehydrogenation/aldol condensation/selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts.

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for In Vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>

         <dc:description>
The relationship between molecular configuration and charge transfer process in NIR&#8208;II chromophores has been revealed, which informed the engineering of an efficient NIR photosensitizer (PS), SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K. The dramatic improvement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield of the PSs enabled NIR&#8208;II image&#8208;guided in vivo pulmonary coronavirus photoablation for the first time and created a convenient paradigm for the development of NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs.







Abstract
Despite significant effort, a majority of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers have short excitation wavelengths, thereby hampering their biomedical applications. Here, we present a facile approach for developing efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers. Based on a series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyads, we found that the star dyad HD with a sterically bulky and electron&#8208;rich moiety exhibited configuration torsion and significantly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to the parent dyad. The electron excitation characteristics of HD changed from local excitation (LE) to charge transfer (CT)&#8208;domain, contributing to a &#8776;6&#8208;fold reduction in energy gap (&#916;EST), a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated ISC process, and a &#8776;31.49&#8208;fold elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield. The optimized SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K lung&#8208;targeting dots enabled real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II lung imaging, which precisely guided rapid pulmonary coronavirus inactivation.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent and Cell&#8208;Free Biosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids Using Vinyl Esters as Smart Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;enzyme cell&#8208;free system transforms vinyl esters into &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids in the absence of ATP and ancillary electron donors through concurrent abiotic thiolysis, non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, ketone reduction and hydrolysis steps. The same substrate provides the energy to activate the acyl group and the redox power to reduce the condensed ketone.







Abstract
In vitro biosynthetic pathways that condense and reduce molecules through coenzyme A (CoASH) activation demand energy and redox power in the form of ATP and NAD(P)H, respectively. These coenzymes must be orthogonally recycled by ancillary reactions that consume chemicals, electricity, or light, impacting the atom economy and/or the energy consumption of the biosystem. In this work, we have exploited vinyl esters as dual acyl and electron donor substrates to synthesize &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids through a non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, reduction and hydrolysis stepwise cascade, including a NADH recycling step, catalyzed by a total of 4 enzymes. Herein, the chemical energy to activate the acyl group with CoASH and the redox power for the reduction are embedded into the vinyl esters. Upon optimization, this self&#8208;sustaining cascade reached a titer of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy butyrate of 24&#8197;mM without requiring ATP and simultaneously recycling CoASH and NADH. This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi&#8208;functional ones.

We report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters resulting in enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes. All four stereoisomers with two adjacent chiral centers were obtained by chirality pairing. Mechanistic studies were conducted to understand the high levels of selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, catalyzed by a chiral iridium complex. The &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters can be chemoselectively coupled with allyl electrophiles, affording a diverse set of enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes in good yields, with excellent stereoselectivity. By permuting the chiral iridium catalysts and the substrates, we efficiently and selectively obtained all four stereoisomers bearing two consecutive chiral centers. Mechanistic studies via density functional theory calculations revealed the origins of the diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivities, indicating the pivotal roles of the steric interaction, the &#946;&#8208;silicon effect, and a rapid desilylation process. Additional synthetic modifications for preparing a variety of enantioenriched compounds containing contiguous chiral centers are also included.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Near&#8208;infrared Repeatable Photochemical Afterglow Mediated by Reversible Storage of Singlet Oxygen for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a general strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) based on the reversible storage of singlet oxygen. Ultra&#8208;long near&#8208;infrared afterglow was achieved via the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence approach, and its intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. The RPA system was further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable read&#8208;out.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow systems have drawn considerable attention in recent years due to their regulable photophysical properties and charming application potential. However, conventional photochemical afterglow suffered from its unrepeatability due to the consumption of energy cache units as afterglow photons are emitted. Here we report a novel strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) through the reversible storage of 1O2 by 2&#8208;pyridones. Near&#8208;infrared afterglow with a lifetime over 10&#8197;s is achieved, and its initial intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. A detailed mechanism study was conducted and confirmed the RPA is realized through the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the generality of this strategy is demonstrated and tunable afterglow lifetimes and colors are achieved by rational design. The developed RPA is further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable&#8208;readout.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amphiphilic solvent is rationally designed to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure bestows improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, and highly robust and conductive SEI, which overcomes the long&#8208;standing Li compatibility and deposition kinetic challenges, enabling the stable operation of Li&#8208;metal battery under ultra&#8208;low temperature.

Lithium metal batteries hold great promise for promoting energy density and operating at low temperatures, yet they still suffer from insufficient Li compatibility and slow kinetic, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Herein, we rationally design and synthesize a new amphiphilic solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methoxypropane, for use in battery electrolytes. The lithiophilic segment is readily to solvate Li+ to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure not only largely improves the ionic conductivity to allow fast Li+ transport and lower the desolvation energy to enable facile desolvation, but also leads to the formation of a highly robust and conductive inorganic SEI. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high Li efficiency and superior cycling stability from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at high current densities. Meanwhile, anode&#8208;free high&#8208;voltage cell retains 87&#8201;% capacity after 100 cycles.

         <title>Vanadium Oxides with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterointerface Network for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium oxide materials with the unique amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure are fabricated using an electrochemical method for the first time. The electrode displays good electrochemical performances as cathode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Experimental and simulation results suggest that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favourable cation adsorption and ion diffusion properties compared to other modelling structures.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;VOx batteries are attracting attention in large scale energy storage applications. Yet, the sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationship are always challenging to fulfil the great potential of the batteries. Here we electrodeposit vanadium oxide nanobelts (VO&#8208;E) with highly disordered structure. The electrode achieves high capacities (e.g., &#8776;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 516&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good rate and cycling performances. Detailed structure analysis indicates VO&#8208;E is composed of integrated amorphous&#8208;crystalline nanoscale domains, forming an efficient heterointerface network in the bulk electrode, which accounts for the good electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favorable cation adsorption and lower ion diffusion energy barriers compared to the amorphous and crystalline counterparts, thus accelerating charge carrier mobility and electrochemical activity of the electrode.

         <title>Evidence of AlII Radical Addition to Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron reduction of diamido&#8208;naphthyl aluminum iodide in benzene produces dialuminyl substituted Birch&#8208;type reduction product. Time dependent EPR experiments in combination with DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism where stable AlII radical intermediates play a crucial role for the reaction outcome. The aluminum radical stability is a consequence of a rigid supporting ligand with silyl protective substituents.







Abstract
Electrophilic AlIII species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent AlI aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8722;C and/or C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an AlII radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8722;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this reactivity proceeds through a stable AlII radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.

         <title>Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization toward Ultrathin COF Membranes for Brine Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy, which actively manipulates the self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect during electrochemical process, is developed for fabricating ultrathin and robust COF membranes for efficient brine desalination.







Abstract
Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85&#8197;nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and the rejection of 99.96&#8201;%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.

One&#8208;electron oxidation converts the ferrocene&#8208;substituted borane into a Lewis superacid, as reported by Frank Breher, Jan Paradies, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202216959). The Lewis superacid activates almost inert carbon&#8211;fluorine and sulfur&#8211;fluorine bonds for reductions, alkylations, and arylations to form new chemical bonds.

A rigid&#8208;flexible hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with guest&#8208;induced reversible crystallinity was designed by Yingjie Zhao and Danbo Wang in their Research Article (e202217903). A specific compound, such as hexane, acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the triangle macrocycle as the building module is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; molecule affects the local flexibility of the whole framework and leads to switchable crystallinity.

         <title>Inside Cover: Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2023)</title>

Light&#8208;driven molecular motors were used as photoactive crosslinks in hydrogels. Their unidirectional rotation under UV light triggers a shift in the equilibrium swelling of the networks because of the creation of new entanglements. In their Research Article (e202300263), Nicolas Giuseppone and co&#8208;workers exploit this actuation to perform mechanical work and show that individual motors can lift loads at least 200 times heavier than their own molecular weight, reminiscent of ants in the macroscopic world.

         <title>Towards Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy Exploration of Plasmonic&#8208;Mediated Phenomena at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrochemiluminescence microscopy is emerging as a high&#8208;throughput spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating plasmonic&#8208;related phenomena in operando conditions. In a recent work, Wei et&#8197;al. combine electrochemiluminescence microscopy and high resolution scanning electron microscopy to explore the plasmon&#8208;enhanced luminescence in gold nanostructures arrays, identifying two different enhancement mechanisms for isolated and coupled nanostructures.







Abstract
The rational design of functional plasmonic metasurfaces and metamaterials requires the development of high&#8208;throughput characterization techniques compatible with operando conditions and capable of addressing single&#8208;nanostructures. In their work, Wei et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of electrochemiluminescence microscopy to investigate the mechanism behind plasmon&#8208;enhanced luminescence induced by gold nanostructures. The use of gold plasmonic arrays was exploited to achieve the rapid spectroscopic evaluation of all the individual nanostructures, and the correlation of the results with high&#8208; resolution electron microscopy analysis, guaranteeing a strict one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence. The authors were able to identify two different mechanisms for the enhancement of [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine electrochemiluminescence mediated by single gold nanoparticles and by small plasmonic clusters. In the future, the proposed characterization could be used for the rapid and in situ spectroscopic analysis of more complex plasmonic nanostructures and metasurfaces.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Chemistries Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work from Guo and co&#8208;workers who proposed a hybrid electrolyte strategy obtained by mixing H2O and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvents to build up a high&#8208;quality phosphate&#8208;based solid&#8208;state interphase layer is highlighted. This new solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protects Zn metal anodes from corrosion and dendrite formation. Thus, ultrahigh Coulombic efficiencies and extended lifespan can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are deemed a promising technology for electrochemical energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, AZMBs still suffer from severe side reactions, including Zn dendrite formation and intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast to the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that stabilizes Li/Na/K metal anodes in organic electrolytes, it is difficult to form an SEI layer on the Zn surface because of the difficulty in decomposing the salt anions within the narrow electrochemical potential window of water. A team from the University of Adelaide reports a novel pure or hybrid electrolyte with H2O by using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvent or co&#8208;solvent to construct a uniform and stable phosphate&#8208;based SEI layer (ZnP2O6 and Zn3(PO4)2). As a result, high Coulombic efficiencies and improved capacity retentions are obtained.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein chemistry has evolved remarkably in the past decade, which has enabled the effective production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties for biomedical research, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.







Abstract
Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications&#8212;transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of supramolecular electronics, an emerging and rapidly growing field that converges supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics. Intensive attention is paid to depicting the electrical properties of various individual supramolecular assemblies and the unique quantum effects during intermolecular charge transport. Moreover, the dynamic monitoring of the supramolecular assembly processes at the single&#8208;molecule scale and the application of supramolecular electronics are also discussed.







Abstract
The convergence of supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics offers a new perspective on supramolecular electronics, and provides a new avenue toward understanding and application of intermolecular charge transport at the molecular level. In this review, we will provide an overview of the advances in the characterization technique for the investigation of intermolecular charge transport, and summarize the experimental investigation of several non&#8208;covalent interactions, including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, host&#8208;guest interactions and &#963;&#8208;&#963; interactions at the single&#8208;molecule level. We will also provide a perspective on supramolecular electronics and discuss the potential applications and future challenges.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Oxycarbenes: New Synthetic and Catalytic Applications beyond Group 6 Fischer Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes.







Abstract
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Compared to the widely studied oxycarbene metal complexes bearing Group 6 metals, the synthetic and catalytic applications of oxycarbenes beyond Group 6 Fischer carbene complexes are less explored because of the difficulty in controlling their reactivity and the need to use a stoichiometric amount of a presynthesized Group 6 metal carbene complex as the starting material. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes. We hope this Minireview will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their synthesis, their advantages in photocatalysis, and the strategies for boosting their photocatalytic performance are summarized in this review. Current problems and their solutions are presented.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.

         <title>A Bidentate Ligand Featuring Ditopic Lewis Acids in the Second Sphere for Selective Substrate Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bidentate ligand featuring secondary sphere ditopic Lewis acids. We verify a Lewis acid additivity effect for the ditopic boranes compared to a monotopic analogue using hydride ion affinity and competition studies. We show chemoselective nitrite capture in the presence of other anions. Pre&#8208;organized hydrazine adducts in the second sphere of Zn and Fe are functionalized to hydrazido and diazene ligands, respectively.

We present a ligand platform featuring appended ditopic Lewis acids to facilitate capture/activation of diatomic substrates. We show that incorporation of two 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) units on a single carbon tethered to a pyridine pyrazole scaffold maintains a set of unquenched nitrogen donors available to coordinate FeII, ZnII, and NiII. Using hydride ion affinity and competition experiments, we establish an additive effect for ditopic secondary sphere boranes, compared to the monotopic analogue. These effects are exploited to achieve high selectivity for binding NO2&#8722; in the presence of competitive anions such as F&#8722; and NO3&#8722;. Finally, we demonstrate hydrazine capture within the second&#8208;sphere of metal complexes, followed by unique activation pathways to generate hydrazido and diazene ligands on Zn and Fe, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of a bidentate ligand featuring secondary sphere ditopic Lewis acids. We verify a Lewis acid additivity effect for the ditopic boranes compared to a monotopic analogue using hydride ion affinity and competition studies. We show chemoselective nitrite capture in the presence of other anions. Pre-organized hydrazine adducts in the second sphere of Zn and Fe are functionalized to hydrazido and diazene ligands, respectively.

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Coulomb interaction&#8208;promoted ion kinetics enables a dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage electrode with high energy and power densities.







Abstract
Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 cycled more than 20&#8201;000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphane, PH3, is a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas that is often contaminated with H2 and P2H4. The inexpensive &#945;&#8208;Mg formate MOF adsorbs up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3 and allows safe handling of phosphane in air. This MOF is moreover a candidate for PH3 purification and longtime P2H4 storage in air and at room temperature.







Abstract
Phosphane, PH3&#8212;a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas&#8212;is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25&#8201;&#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time&#8776;6&#8197;h). Diphosphane, P2H4, is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4&#8197;months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.

         <title>Tetranuclear CuII Cluster as the Ten Node Building Unit for the Construction of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper&#8208;based cluster node [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] formed by the organic ligand H4L (3,5&#8208; dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid) leads to a novel metal&#8211;organic framework FJU&#8208;112. BPE (1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) divides the larger pore space of FJU&#8208;112 into a structure with smaller aperture size and infinite cages which greatly enhances the adsorption and selective separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (FJU&#8208;112) with the ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208;Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of FJU&#8208;112 were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. FJU&#8208;112 exhibits a high separation performance for the C2H2/CO2 separation, which were established by the temperature&#8208;dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab&#8208;scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C2H2/CO2 separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between the C2H2 molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C2H2 uptakes over CO2 molecules.

The Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine has led to the synthesis of the useful synthon 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin. This synthon was used for the preparation of tetraarylated NiII porphyrins, octaarylated NiII porphyrins, a quadruply bridged non&#8208;offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face porphyrin dimer, single&#8208;linked cross&#8208;shaped porphyrin pentamers and nonamers, as well as pentameric porphyrin tapes.







Abstract
2,7,12,17&#8208;Tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin 5&#8201;Ni was synthesized in 75&#8201;% yield by Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine followed by NiII metalation and has been demonstrated to be a useful synthon, giving 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetraaryated NiII porphyrins 6&#8201;a&#8211;d, peripherally octaarylated NiII porphyrins 8&#8201;a&#8211;d, quadruply bridged face&#8208;to&#8208;face non&#8208;offset NiII&#8208;porphyrin dimer 12, and cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers and nonamers. Oxidation of cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers 14&#8201;Ni and 14&#8201;Zn gave fused pentameric tapes 15&#8201;Ni and 15&#8201;Zn. The structures of 12, 14&#8201;Zn, and 15&#8201;Ni have been revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Optical separation of 12 has been accomplished, showing a bisignate coupling pattern for exciton&#8208;coupled blue&#8208;shifted Soret band. Pentameric porphyrin tape 15&#8201;Zn exhibits a red&#8208;shifted absorption band at 1156&#8197;nm and seven reversible redox waves.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid through Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Application in C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters allows for the straightforward synthesis of strong boron&#8208;centered Lewis superacids. The Lewis superacids were characterized by NMR, XRD and FIA computation. The ferrocenium&#8208;substituted boranes were applied in catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activations.







Abstract
A series of redox&#8208;responsive ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters were synthesized. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl ligand to the ferrocenium resulted in a drastic increase in the Lewis acidity beyond the strength of SbF5, which was investigated experimentally and computationally. The resulting highly Lewis acidic boron compounds were used for catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activation.

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;Charged Halides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium intercalation chemistry in layered VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) enabled by compatible halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes was explored for the first time. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial stability can be achieved in a thermodynamic manner instead of by passivation, ensured by the good chemical stability between the VX3 cathode and halide electrolytes as well as the wide electrochemical stability windows.







Abstract
Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.

         <title>Dendronized DNA Chimeras Harness Scavenger Receptors To Degrade Cell Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy for targeted membrane protein degradation is reported. DENTAC comprises a protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI) binder linked with a dendritic DNA, which engages cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) to transport the POI into the lysosome for degradation.







Abstract
Bispecific chimeras bridging cell membrane proteins with lysosome&#8208;trafficking receptors (LTRs) provide an effective therapeutic approach through lysosomal degradation of disease&#8208;relevant targets. Here, we report a novel dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy that uses a dendritic DNA to engage cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) as LTR. Using bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to conjugate the dendritic DNA with protein binder, the resulting DENTAC is able to traffic the protein target into the lysosome for elimination. We demonstrated the utility of DENTAC by degrading oncogenic membrane nucleolin (NCL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The anti&#8208;cancer application of NCL&#8208;targeting DENTAC was validated in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer. This work thus presents a new avenue for rapid development of potent degraders against membrane proteins, with also broad research and therapeutic prospects.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Radical Amidation and Amination of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds via Dual Copper and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation and amination is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation displays broad substrate scope and good atom economy, is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and enables easy access to 15N&#8208;labeling from cheap [15N]&#8208;NH4Cl.







Abstract
A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate&#8208;protected primary benzylamines by C&#8722;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8722;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to 15N&#8208;labeled amides and amines starting from cheap 15NH4Cl.

This dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation displays broad substrate scope and good atom economy, is amenable to late-stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and enables easy access to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeling from cheap [&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate-protected primary benzylamines by C&#8722;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8722;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late-stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled amides and amines starting from cheap &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Enabling High Overall Nitrogen Fixation Performance for Atomically Dispersed Fe on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was further involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for superior nitrogen fixation performance.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was firstly involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Excitingly, an unanticipated yield of 7055.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. and 12&#8201;868.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. were obtained for NOR and NRR at 3.5&#8197;V, respectively, 44.94 times and 7.8 times increase in FE than the conventional constant voltage electrocatalytic method. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the single&#8208;atom Fe could stabilize the oxygen vacancy, lower the energy barrier for the vital rupture of N&#8801;N, and result in enhanced N2 fixation performance. More importantly, PE could effectively enhance the N2 supply by reducing competitive O2 and H2 agglomeration, inhibit the electrocatalytic by&#8208;product formation for longstanding *OOH and *H intermediates, and promote the non&#8208;electrocatalytic process of N2 activation.

         <title>Preferential Adsorption of Ethylene Oxide on Fe and Chlorine on Ni Enabled Scalable Electrosynthesis of Ethylene Chlorohydrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preferential adsorption of ethylene oxide on Fe and chlorine on Ni enabled the electrosynthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) with high conversion and selectivity. Scalable production of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH with 92.5&#8201;% yield at 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;h, paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (an herbicide), and successful fabrication of a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols highlight the potential utilities.







Abstract
Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorb on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH in 1&#8197;h with 92.5&#8201;% yield at a 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively loading and unloading Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.

         <title>Enabled Efficient Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Supply in a Zinc&#8211;Nitrate Battery System by Separating Nitrate Reduction Process into Two Stages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the efficient electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3, a two&#8208;stage process following the [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway is proposed inspired by biological nitrate respiration. This system produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 at low overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE), resulting in a low energy consumption of 17.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for NH3 production and high energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery.







Abstract
The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; into NH3 (NitrRR) presents a sustainable route applicable to NH3 production and potentially energy storage. However, the NitrRR involves a directly eight&#8208;electron transfer process generally required a large overpotential (&lt;&#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) to reach optimal efficiency. Here, inspired by biological nitrate respiration, the NitrRR was separated into two stages along a [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway to alleviate the kinetic barrier. The system employed a Cu nanowire catalyst produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 with current efficiencies of 91.5&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively at lower overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE). The high efficiency for such a reduction process was further explored in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery. This battery could be specified by a high output voltage of 0.70&#8197;V, an average energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is well beyond all previously reported similar concepts.

         <title>Optically Controlled Recovery and Recycling of Homogeneous Organocatalysts Enabled by Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable organocatalysts have been generated that undergo reversible dissolution and precipitation upon photo&#8208;irradiation. The insoluble solid&#8208;state catalysts are photo&#8208;switched to form soluble isomers that activate and complete two types of base&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Irradiation with visible light promotes the precipitation of the catalyst with a recovery rate of 87&#8201;%, which can be reused in multiple rounds of subsequent reactions.







Abstract
We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially insoluble catalysts are UV&#8208;switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back&#8208;isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87&#8201;% recovery by the light&#8208;induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.

Irradiation with visible light promotes the precipitation of the catalyst with a recovery rate of 87&#8201;%, which can be reused in multiple rounds of subsequent reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially insoluble catalysts are UV-switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back-isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87&#8201;% recovery by the light-induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes with High Lithium Ionic Conductivity &gt;10&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant interest as next&#8208;generation energy storage. Halides such as Li3YCl6 are promising candidates for SE because they combine high oxidation stability and deformability. However, the ionic conductivities of halide SEs are not as high as those of other SEs, especially sulfides. Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Bulk&#8208;type ASSB cells using the oxyhalides as the cathode SE demonstrate an outstanding rate capability with a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 5&#8197;C/0.1&#8197;C. We believe that the proposed oxyhalides are promising SE candidates for the practical applications of ASSBs.

         <title>Selective Separation of Lithium, Magnesium and Calcium using 4&#8208;Phosphoryl Pyrazolones as pH&#8208;Regulated Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise separation of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Li+ has been achieved by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction employing a series of advanced 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone ligands together with TOPO (trioctylphosphine oxide) as co&#8208;ligand via pH regulation. X&#8208;ray crystal structure determinations of selected complexes revealed diverse binding modes across all three metal species.







Abstract
Ensuring continuous and sustainable lithium supply requires the development of highly efficient separation processes such as LLE (liquid&#8208;liquid extraction) for both primary sources and certain waste streams. In this work, 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones are used in an efficient pH&#8208;controlled stepwise separation of Li+ from Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. The factors affecting LLE process, such as the substitution pattern of the extractant, diluent/water distribution, co&#8208;ligand, pH, and speciation of the metal complexes involved, were systematically investigated. The maximum extraction efficiency of Li+ at pH&#8197;6.0 was 94&#8201;% when Mg2+ and Ca2+ were previously separated at pH&lt;5.0, proving that the separation of these ions is possible by simply modulating the pH of the aqueous phase. Our study points a way to separation of lithium from acid brine or from spent lithium ion battery leaching solutions, which supports the future supply of lithium in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclobutenone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bench&#8208;stable cyclobutenone surrogates that undergo Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids to yield cyclobutenyl enol ethers in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This transformation proceeds via enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination. The reaction is fast and proceeds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Complex cyclobutanes are important motifs in both bioactive molecules and natural products, yet their enantioselective preparation has not been widely explored. In this work, we describe rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions to cyclobutenone.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on MBenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBenes are demonstrated to be a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). Taking FeB2 as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept paradigm, mechanistic studies unveil that the synergistic tandem effect of Fe and B atoms promotes NO3&#8722; activation and intermediate hydrogenation to enhance the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
We demonstrate the great feasibility of MBenes as a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). As a proof of concept, FeB2 is first employed as a model MBene catalyst for the NO3RR, showing a maximum NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;% with a corresponding NH3 yield of 25.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the exceptional NO3RR activity of FeB2 arises from the tandem catalysis mechanism, that is, B sites activate NO3&#8722; to form intermediates, while Fe sites dissociate H2O and increase *H supply on B sites to promote the intermediate hydrogenation and enhance the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.
