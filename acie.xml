         <title>Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxides with Ultra&#8208;Small Micropores for C2 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of C  2  hydrocarbons, C  2  H  6  , C  2  H  4  , and C  2  H  2  , remains significant challenges in chemical industry. However, there are only few adsorbents that can effectively isolate C  2  hydrocarbons from their mixtures particularly at a high temperature. Herein, we design a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates with metal ion linkers. Single gas adsorption of the material shows the different adsorption performances for the C  2  hydrocarbons and the strong interaction of the material with the C  2  hydrocarbons. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates each of the binary C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures and even the ternary C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures with high selectivity. The material keeps high separation performance even the temperature was increased to 85  o  C. The material is stable and is able to be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of b&#8208;Branched Aromatic a&#8208;Amino Acids via Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>b &#8208;branched noncanonical amino acids are valuable molecules in modern drug development efforts. However, they are still challenging to prepare due to the need to set multiple stereocenters in a stereoselective fashion and contemporary methods to achieve this often relies on the use of rare transition metal catalysis with designer ligand. Here, we report a biocatalytic transamination method to prepare a broad range of aromatic b &#8208;branched a &#8208;amino acids that proceeds with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies show that the transformation proceeds through dynamic kinetic resolution that is unique to the optimal enzyme. To highlight its utility and practicality, the biocatalytic reaction is applied to the synthesis of several sp  3  &#8208;rich cyclic fragments and in the first total synthesis of jomthonic acid A .</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of  in situ  Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) allows to analyze the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and cluster&#8208;solvent interactions as they take place. Here, we demonstrate the method for the formation of clusters with a [Bi  38  O  45  ] core. Upon dissolution of crystalline [Bi  6  O  5  (OH)  3  (NO  3  )  5  ]&#183;3H  2  O in DMSO, an intermediate rapidly forms, which slowly grows to stable [Bi  38  O  45  ] clusters. To identify the intermediate, we developed an automated modelling method, where smaller [Bi  x  O  y  ] structures, based on the [Bi  38  O  45  ] framework, are tested against the data. [Bi  22  O  26  ] was identified as the main intermediate species, illustrating how combined PDF and SAXS analysis is a powerful tool to provide insights into nucleation on an atomic scale. In addition, we use PDF to provide information on the interaction between nanoclusters and solvent, which is shown to depend on the nature of the ligands on the cluster surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall nanocapsules obtained by controlling Ostwald ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6 nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8208;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8208;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Hybrid of an Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster and Polyoxometalates for H2 Cleavage into Protons and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise silver (Ag) nanoclusters are promising materials as catalysts, photocatalysts, and sensors because of their unique structures and mixed&#8208;valence states (Ag+/Ag0). However, their low stability hinders the in&#8208;depth study of their intrinsic reactivity and catalytic property accompanying their redox processes. Herein, we demonstrate that a molecular hybrid of an atomically precise {Ag27}17+  nanocluster and polyoxometalates (POMs) can efficiently cleave H2  into protons and electrons. The Ag nanocluster accommodates electrons through the redox reaction from {Ag27}17+  to {Ag27}13+, and the POM ligands play the following important roles: (i) a significant stabilization of the typically unstable Ag nanocluster to preserve its structure during the redox reaction with H2, (ii) formation of a unique interface between the Ag nanocluster and metal oxides for efficient H2  cleavage, and (iii) storage of the generated protons on the negatively charged basic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activity of Metal Coordination Polymer via d&#8208;&#960; Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble transition metal complexes have attracted growing interest as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while their activities still lack rational and effective regulation. Herein, we propose a d&#8208;&#960; conjugation strategy for rough and fine tuning of ORR activity in TM&#8208;BTA (TM = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA = 1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) coordination polymers. By first&#8208;principle calculations, we elucidate that the strong d&#8208;&#960; conjugation elevates the  [[EQUATION]] / [[EQUATION]]  orbitals of TM centers to enhance intermediate absorption and strengthens the electronic modulation effect from substitute groups on ligands. Based on this strategy, Co&#8208;TABQ (tetramino benzoquinone) are found to approach the top of ORR activity volcano. The synthesized Co&#8208;TABQ with atomically distributed Co on carbon nanotubes exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and a specific current of 130 mA mgmetal&#8208;1 at 0.8 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. The high activity, low peroxide yield, and considerable durability of Co&#8208;BTA and Co&#8208;TABQ promise their application in oxygen electrocatalysis. This study provides mechanistic insight into the rational design of transition metal complexes catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Strategy of Manipulating the Number of Selenophene Units and Asymmetric Central Core of Small Molecular Acceptors Enables Polymer Solar Cells with 17.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, despite the great achievement made in non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs)&#8208;based polymer solar cells (PSCs), the favourable trade&#8208;off among device parameters is still quite difficult to obtain for further development. Herein,  a novel synergistic strategy of the asymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was applied for the first time  and a new family of  symmetric or asymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type NF&#8208;SMAs (  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  ,  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  , and  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  ) with different numbers of selenophene  were successfully synthesized.  From  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  to  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  and to  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  , a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed.  Moreover, single crystals results indicate that  A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  and  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl  exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based  S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl  . Furthermore,  PM6  :A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl  blend film exhibits the most favourable morphology with the best face&#8208;on intermolecular packing, and the most efficient charge separation, transport and collection. The asymmetric  A&#8208;  WSSe&#8208;C  l  &#8208;based device presents an impressive PCE of 17.51%, which is obvious higher than that of symmetric  S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;  based (16.01%) and is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary PSCs. These results demonstrate that the combination of the subtle asymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is an effective approach to improve  J  sc  and FF without over sacrificing of  V  oc  for efficient NF&#8208;SMAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Cooperative Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Efficient and Selective Catalysis with Chiral Molecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting the emerging noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions, e.g. anion&#8208;&#960; interaction, in catalyst design represents a fascinating direction to develop new and fundamental catalysis principle. For the appealing yet flexible &#960;&#8208;face activation, can two or more &#960;&#8208;acidic surfaces be manipulated for cooperative activation to achieve efficient transformation and particularly selectivity control is highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate a facile and efficient supramolecular &#960;&#8208;catalysis strategy through establishing cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation in a confined electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity. The catalysts consist of a triazine based prism&#8208;like cage core and pendant chiral base sites and were synthesized straightforwardly. Only 2 mol% of cage catalyst efficiently catalyzed the decarboxylate Mannich reactions of sulfamate&#8208;headed cyclic aldimines and a series of malonic acid half thioesters in nearly quantitative yields and up to 97% ee, enabling an unprecedent organocatalytic approach for the titled reactions. Collective experiment results consistently suggested the essential role of the supramolecular &#960;&#8208;cavity in harnessing cooperative anion&#8208;&#960; interactions for the efficient activation and excellent selectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Engineering of One&#8208;Dimensional Hollow Nanostructures for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D hollow nanostructures have been considered as promising electrode materials for different electrochemical energy storage applications. This Minireview gives an overview of recent achievements in the rational design and engineering of 1D hollow nanostructures as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. This unique class of electrodes offers significant advantages for boosting the electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures result in intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties for different kinds of electrochemical energy storage applications (i.e. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes, metal&#8208;air batteries, supercapacitors). We conclude with prospects on some critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative studies on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications will be stimulated.

         <title>Highly Stable Single Crystals of Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Oligomer Frameworks Synthesized under Kinetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various porous organic single crystals were self&#8208;assembled via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, based on in situ&#8208;formed oligomers linked by imine bonds that appeared via condensation between tetratopic amine and ditopic aldehyde compounds. These structures were noted to remain sufficiently robust even after guest removal, and offered accessible porosity that was comparable, or even superior, to that of other COF materials.







Abstract
Various robust, crystalline, and porous organic frameworks based on in situ&#8208;formed imine&#8208;linked oligomers were investigated. These oligomers self&#8208;assembled through collaborative intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions via liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial reactions. The soluble oligomers were kinetic products with multiple unreacted aldehyde groups that acted as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and directed the assembly of the resulting oligomers into 3D frameworks. The sequential formation of robust covalent linkages and highly reversible hydrogen bonds enforced long&#8208;range symmetry and facilitated the production of large single crystals, with structures that were unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The unique hierarchical arrangements increased the steric hindrance of the imine bond, which prevented attacks from water molecules, greatly improving the stability. The multiple binding sites in the frameworks enabled rapid sequestration of micropollutant in water.

         <title>Origins of Endo Selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclic Allene Dienophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of the factors contributing to endo selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with strained cyclic allenes is reported. The contributions of a new type of secondary orbital interaction resulting from the twisted nature of the strained allene, and electrostatic effects, to endo selectivity are established.







Abstract
Strained cyclic allenes, first discovered in 1966 by Wittig and co&#8208;workers, have recently emerged as valuable synthetic building blocks. Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles with 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene and oxa&#8208; and azaheterocyclic analogs proceed with endo selectivity. This endo selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene endo to the diene carbons. The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Our computational study establishes the origins of this endo selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon&#8208;3 of the allene (C&#8208;3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C&#8208;1 favors the endo position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long&#8208;avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Defect Passivation in Lead&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals and Thin Films: Toward Efficient LEDs and Solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of lead&#8208;halide perovskites, defects at the surface of colloidal nanocrystals and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the photoluminescence quantum yields, device efficiency, and stability. This Review summarizes the defects, their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties, and passivation strategies to mitigate the effects of defects.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs), in the form of both colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and thin films, have emerged over the past decade as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation, efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. Owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), LHPs efficiently convert injected charge carriers into light and vice versa. However, despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of LHPs, defects at the surface of colloidal NCs and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the PLQYs, device efficiency, and stability. Therefore, understanding the defects that play a key role in limiting performance, and developing effective passivation routes are critical for achieving advances in performance. This Review presents the current understanding of defects in halide perovskites and their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Passivation strategies toward improving the efficiencies of perovskite&#8208;based LEDs and solar cells are also discussed.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Constraint&#8208;Induced Peroxide Activation for Electrophilic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core has been found to be a reactive electrophile that is capable of initiating hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfer reactions. The electrophilicity of 1 is attributed to the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core and represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxo reactivity.







Abstract
&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediates P are proposed as reactive intermediates in various biological oxidation reactions. In sMMO, P acts as an electrophile, and performs hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfers to electron&#8208;rich substrates. In cyanobacterial ADO, however, P is postulated to react by nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbon atoms. In biomimetic studies, the ability of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complexes of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu to act as nucleophiles that effect deformylation of aldehydes is documented. By performing reactivity and theoretical studies on an end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core, we now show that a peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complex can also be a reactive electrophile. The observed electrophilic chemistry, which is induced by the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core, represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxide reactivity.

         <title>Absolute Quantification of Drug Vector Delivery to the Cytosol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macromolecular drug delivery vectors must translocate at the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes to reach the cytosol. This very inefficient process requires optimization, which is hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. An exceptionally sensitive and robust assay to quantify this step was developed. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of two macromolecular vectors reaching the cytosol.







Abstract
Macromolecular drugs inefficiently cross membranes to reach their cytosolic targets. They require drug delivery vectors to facilitate their translocation across the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes. Optimization of these vectors has however been hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. We have developed an exceptionally sensitive and robust assay for the relative or absolute quantification of this step. The assay is based on benzylguanine and biotin modifications on a drug delivery vector of interest, which allow, respectively, for selective covalent capture in the cytosol with a SNAP&#8208;tag fusion protein and for quantification at picomolar sensitivity. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of cytosolic molecules for two drug delivery vectors: the B&#8208;subunit of Shiga toxin and the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide TAT. We expect this assay to favor delivery vector optimization and the understanding of the enigmatic translocation process.

         <title>Facet Selectivity Guided Assembly of Nanoarchitectures onto Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facet&#8208;selective nanostructures in living systems usually exhibit outstanding optical and enzymatic properties and play important roles in biological functions such as photonics, matter exchange, and biocatalysis. Bioinspired construction of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures offers great opportunities for sophisticated nanomaterials with extended applications, but remains a formidable task. Herein, a macromolecule&#8208;mediated strategy was developed for the assembly of upconversion nanoparticles/two dimemsional metal&#8208;organic framework (UCNPs/2DMOFs) heterostructures with facet selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be utilized as an interface&#8208;selective mediator to further promote the facet&#8208;selective assembly of MOFs onto the surface of UCNPs. More importantly, the UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures with facet selectivity display specific optical properties and show great advantages in multiplexed coding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Our demonstration of UCNPs/2DMOFs provides a vivid example for the controlled fabrication of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures and can promote the development of advanced functional materials for applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and information assurance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Realize Surface Reconstruction of Small&#8208;Sized Pt&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, despite substantial efforts have been devoted to the modifications of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) for tailoring their selectivities for hydrogenation reactions, it is still lack of facile strategies for precisely regulating the surface properties of NPs, especially for those ones with small sizes. In this work, we propose a top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy for tuning the surface properties of Pt&#8208;based NPs (~4 nm) without the occurrence of aggregation. Compare to conventional bottom&#8208;up methods, the present top&#8208;down strategy can precisely regulate the surface compositions of Pt&#8208;Cd NPs and other ternary Pt&#8208;Cd&#8208;M NPs (M = Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Sn). The optimized Pt&#8208;Cd NPs exhibit excellent selectivity toward phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenations with a styrene selectivity and 4&#8208;aminophenyl styrene selectivity of 95.2% and 94.5%, respectively. This work provides a general strategy for the surface reconstructions of Pt&#8208;based NPs, and promotes the fundamental researches on catalyst design for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of a Pyrrole Intermediate Which Undergoes C&#8208;Glycosidation and Autoxidation to Yield the Final Product in Showdomycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Showdomycin is a C&#8208;nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1  H  &#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the C&#8208;glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5&#8208;phosphate, the resulting C&#8208;nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic C&#8208;nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities .</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Showdomycin is a C-nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2-amino-1  H  -pyrrole-5-carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the C-glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5-phosphate, the resulting C-nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic C-nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring Solid&#8208;phase Reactions in Self&#8208;assembled Monolayers by Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanopatterned surfaces enhance incident electromagnetic radiation and thereby enable the detection and characterization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), for instance in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In this work, Au nanohole arrays, developed and characterized as SERS substrates, are exemplarily used for monitoring a solid&#8208;phase deprotection and a subsequent copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; reaction, performed directly on the corresponding SAMs. The SERS substrate was found to be highly reliable in terms of signal reproducibility and chemical stability. Furthermore, the intermediates and the product of the solid&#8208;phase synthesis were identified by SERS. The spectra of the immobilized compounds showed minor differences compared to spectra of the microcrystalline solids. With its uniform SERS signals and the high chemical stability, the platform is paving the way to monitor molecular manipulations in surface functionalization applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenacyl Phenothiazinium Salt as A New Broad&#8208;wavelength&#8208;absorbing Photoinitiator for Cationic and Free Radical Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel broad&#8208;wavelength&#8208;absorbing photoinitiator based on phenacyl phenothiazinium hexafluroantimonate (P&#8208;PTh) possessing both phenacyl and phenothiazine chromophoric groups was reported. P&#8208;PTh absorbs light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region. Photophysical, photochemical, and computational investigations revealed that P&#8208;PTh in solution decomposes at all wavelengths by homolytic and heterolytic cleavages and generates cationic and radical species, which could efficiently initiate cationic and free radical polymerizations. It is anticipated that the photoinitiator with such wavelength flexibility may open up new pathways in curing applications of formulations of pigment systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Colorimetric metal&#8208;free detection of carbon monoxide: reversible CO uptake by a BNB frustrated Lewis pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two BNB&#8208;type frustrated Lewis pairs which feature an acceptor/donor/acceptor functionalized cavity, and which differ in the nature of the B&#8208;bound fluoroaryl group (C  6  F  5  &#160;vs. C  6  H  3  (CF  3  )  2  &#8208;3,5, Ar  f  ). These receptor systems are capable of capturing gaseous CO, and in the case of the &#8211;BAr  f  2  &#160;system this can be shown to occur in reversible fashion at/above room temperature. For both systems, the binding event is accompanied by migration of one of the aryl substituents to the electrophilic carbon of the CO guest. Experiments utilizing an additional equivalent of P  t  Bu  3  &#160;allow the initially&#8208;formed (non&#8208;migrated) CO adduct to be identified and trapped (via demethylation), while also establishing the reversibility of the B&#8208;to&#8208;C migration process. When partnered with the slightly less Lewis acidic &#8211;BAr  f  2  &#160;substituent, this reversibility allows for release of the captured carbon monoxide in the temperature range 40&#8208;70&#160; &#186; C, and the possibility for CO sensing, making use of the associated colourless to orange/red colour change.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Micelle as An In Vivo Catalyst for Tumor&#8208;Localized Cleavage Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging strategies of accelerating the cleavage reaction in tumor through locally enriching the reactants is promising. Yet, the applications are limited due to the lack of the tumor&#8208;selectivity for most of the reactants. Here we explored an alternative approach to leverage the rate constant by locally inducing an  in vivo  catalyst. We found that the desilylation&#8208;induced cleavage chemistry could be catalyzed  in vivo  by cationic micelles, and accelerated over 1400&#8208;fold under physiological condition. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed controlled release platform is demonstrated by the release of a 6&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazole derivative (HQB) in two cancer cell lines and a NIR dye in mouse tumor xenografts. Through intravenous injection of a pH&#8208;sensitive polymer micelles, we successfully applied this strategy to a prodrug activation of hydroxyl camptothecin (OH&#8208;CPT) in tumors. Its &#8220;decaging&#8221; efficiency is 42&#8208;fold to that without cationic micelles&#8211;mediated catalysis. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelle may act beyond a carrier but a catalyst for local perturbing or activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Sequential Catalysis featuring Two Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study demonstrates the feasibility and inherent benefits of combining two distinct asymmetric transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one&#8208;pot. The reported transformation features a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation and a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition, effectively converting simple allyl enol carbonate precursors into enantioenriched cyclic ketones with two remote stereocenters. Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to &gt; 99% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst&#8208;control, this one&#8208;pot reaction is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers starting from the same set of starting materials.</dc:description>

Here, we report photoresponsive supramolecular microcapsules with jammed NPS assemblies at the oil&#8208;water interface, taking advantage of host&#8208;guest molecular recognition. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the NPSs from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart microcapsule systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Diazomethyl Radicals by Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Their Cycloaddition with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general catalytic methodology for the synthesis of pyrazolines from  &#945;  &#8208;diazo compounds and conjugated alkenes is reported. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process of  &#945;  &#8208;diazo compounds promoted by the  tert  &#8208;butylperoxy radical generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the carbon atom attached with the diazo group. The regiocontrolled addition of diazomethyl radicals to carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds followed by intramolecular ring closure on the terminal diazo nitrogen and tautomerization affords a diverse set of pyrazolines in good yields with excellent regioselectivity. This strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of  &#945;  &#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes. Furthermore, the straightforward formation of the diazomethyl radicals provides umpolung reactivity, thus opening new opportunities for the versatile transformations of diazo compounds.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A general catalytic methodology for the synthesis of pyrazolines from  &#945;  -diazo compounds and conjugated alkenes is reported. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process of  &#945;  -diazo compounds promoted by the  tert  -butylperoxy radical generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the carbon atom attached with the diazo group. The regiocontrolled addition of diazomethyl radicals to carbon-carbon double bonds followed by intramolecular ring closure on the terminal diazo nitrogen and tautomerization affords a diverse set of pyrazolines in good yields with excellent regioselectivity. This strategy overcomes the limitations of electron-deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]-cycloaddition of  &#945;  -diazo compounds with alkenes. Furthermore, the straightforward formation of the diazomethyl radicals provides umpolung reactivity, thus opening new opportunities for the versatile transformations of diazo compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protonated imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as an important class of organic semiconductors for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When tuning the photocatalytic activity of COFs, efforts are typically invested on choosing the proper combination of linkers. However, the effect of the linkage on the photocatalytic performance has rarely been studied. Herein, we demonstrate that upon protonation of Schiff&#8208;base moieties, donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type imine&#8208;linked COFs can produce hydrogen with a rate as high as 20.7 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  under visible light irradiation. A significant red shift in light absorbance, largely improved charge separation efficiency, as well as an increase in hydrophilicity triggered by protonation of the Schiff&#8208;base moieties in the imine&#8208;linked COFs, are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance. The protonation phenomenon, which has not been investigated within the context of imine COFs photocatalytic HER before, arose as a key aspect to improve the photocatalytic performance. On the other hand, it is also instructive to broaden the application of COFs as semiconductors in light harvest and transformation, such as organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID&#8208;19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose&#8208;built transflection accessory for rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of COVID&#8208;19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM&#8208;IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 patients testing positive for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by RT&#8208;qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The sensitivity was 93 % (27/29) and specificity of 82 % (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT&#8208;qPCR. Here, we demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high throughput infrared COVID&#8208;19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self&#8208;collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Aptamer&#8208;based Protein Tagging with Metabolic Glycan Labeling for In Situ Visualization and Biological Function Study of Exosomal Protein&#8208;Specific Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exosomal glycoproteins play important roles in many physiological and pathological functions. However, the existing methods for studying glycosylation of exosomal proteins of interest are often cumbersome and affect the exosome integrity. Herein, we developed a dual labeling strategy based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling for visualizing glycosylation of specific proteins on exosomes. The glycosylation of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (exoPD&#8208;L1) was imaged in situ using intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent PD&#8208;L1 aptamers bound on exoPD&#8208;L1 and fluorescent tags on glycans introduced via metabolic glycan labeling. This method enables in situ visualization and biological function study of exosomal protein glycosylation. Through this strategy, exoPD&#8208;L1 glycosylation was confirmed for the first time to be required in interaction with PD&#8208;1 and participated in inhibiting of CD8+ T cell proliferation. In general, we have developed an efficient and non&#8208;destructive method to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation in situ, which provides a powerful tool for exosomal glycoproteomics research.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Pore Chemistry in An Ultramicroporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Benchmark Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation of CO2 from acetylene (C2H2) via CO2&#8208;selective sorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly technology for C2H2 purification, but a strategic and daunting challenge due to the similarities in shape, size, and physiochemical properties of these two gases. There is still no specific methodology for the sorbent construction with CO2&#8208;preferential adsorption capability over C2H2. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to construct a Ce(IV)&#8208;based ultramicroporous metal&#8208;organic framework, Ce(IV)&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F, for the efficient inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer in this MOF is facilitated by the Ce(IV) ion with low&#8208;lying unoccupied 4f orbitals and tetrafluoroterephthalate linker with four electron&#8208;withdrawing F atoms, affording a perfect pore environment to match CO2 with remarkable inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity. On the other hand, the Zr(IV)&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F congener exhibits conventional C2H2&#8208;selective sorption behavior. The exceptional CO2 uptake (151.7 cm3 cm&#8208;3) of Ce(IV)&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F along with high separation selectivities (above 40) for CO2/C2H2 mixtures set a new benchmark for inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The unique CO2 recognition mechanism is unveiled by in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and molecular calculations. Simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments comprehensively demonstrate the great potential of Ce(IV)&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F for efficient inverse CO2/C2H2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy imaging of Alzheimer&#8217;s amyloid&#8208;beta 42 oligomer displayed on a functionally and structurally relevant scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;) oligomers are pathogenic species of amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Like certain protein toxins, A&#946; oligomers permeabilize cellular membranes, presumably through a pore formation mechanism. Due to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42&#8208;pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional and biological properties with wild&#8208;type A&#946;42&#8208;pores. Single&#8208;particle cryo&#8208;EM analysis of A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall resolution of 3.3 &#197;) reveals the A&#946;42&#8208;pore region to be intrinsically flexible. We anticipate that the A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers will allow studying many of the features of the wild type amyloid oligomers that cannot be studied otherwise, and may represent a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno&#8208;base diagnostics and therapies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bot&#8208;tom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructures (SiJARs) with a chemo&#8208;responsive Mn&#8208;silicate lid. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid&#8208;state nanocrystal&#8208;conversion at the arc&#8208;section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the lid&#8208;section through galvanic reactions. And, lid aperture&#8208;opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, SiJARs performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &gt;99%, ee = 95%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal&#8208;conversion chemistry and designing the advanced platforms for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Light to Modify Selectivity of Transition Metal Catalysed Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light has a remarkable and often unique ability to promote chemical reactions. In combination with transition metal catalysis, it offers exciting opportunities to modify catalyst function in a non&#8208;invasive manner, most frequently being reported to switch on or accelerate reactions that do not occur in the dark. However, the ability to completely change reactivity or selectivity between two different reaction outcomes remains considerably rarer. This minireview aims to bring together examples of this concept and highlight their mechanistically distinct approaches. By explaining the ability of these non&#8208;natural, photo&#8208;switchable systems to: a) reveal key fundamental mechanistic insights, enhancing our understanding and stimulating development of new catalytic activity; and b) provide tangible applications and impact fields such as polymer chemistry, we rationalise why this small research area is attracting ever&#8208;growing interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging shows modafinil, a student study drug, changes the lipid composition of the fly brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modafinil, a widely used psychoactive drug, has been shown to exert a positive impact on cognition and is used to treat sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging, we studied the changes of brain lipids of  Drosophila melanogaster  induced by modafinil to gain insight into the functional mechanism of modafinil in the brain. We found that upon modafinil treatment, the abundance of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species in the central brain of  Drosophila  is significantly decreased, whereas the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol in the brains show significant enhancement compared to the control flies. The alteration of brain lipids caused by modafinil is consistent with previous studies about cognition&#8208;related drugs and offers a plausible mechanism regarding the action of modafinil in the brain as well as a potential target for the treatment of certain disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Highly Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via &#8216;&#224; la carte&#8217; Multifunctionalization of Borylated Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high relevance of 1,3&#8208;dienes, stereoselective methods to access tetrasubstituted conjugated dienes are still scarce. We here report an efficient and modular approach that provides access to multifunctional tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. This methodology is based on a tetracomponent reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles. Mechanistic studies reveal that this transformation proceeds through a regio&#8208; and stereoselective carbolithiation/electrophilic trapping of an in&#8208;situ formed dendralenic boron&#8208;ate complex, followed by a stereoretentive halodeborylation. The ease in which complex structural dienes can be accessed and their synthetic versatility highlight the importance and utility of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>General, Divergent Platform for Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with High Reactivity and Favorable Physiochemical Properties**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enones (TCOs) with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments are especially hard to access. Readily accessible TCOs are now shown to undergo diastereoselective additions with a broad range of nucleophiles to give access to functionalized axial&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (a&#8208;TCO, a family of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes with high reactivity and improved physiochemical properties.







Abstract
trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes (TCOs) are essential partners in the fastest known bioorthogonal reactions, but current synthetic methods are limited by poor diastereoselectivity. Especially hard to access are hydrophilic TCOs with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments. Described is a new class of TCOs, &#8220;a&#8208;TCOs&#8221;, prepared in high yield by stereocontrolled 1,2&#8208;additions of nucleophiles to trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enone, which itself was prepared on a large scale in two steps from 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Computational transition&#8208;state models rationalize the diastereoselectivity of 1,2&#8208;additions to deliver a&#8208;TCO products, which were also shown to be more reactive than standard TCOs and less hydrophobic than even a trans&#8208;oxocene analogue. Illustrating the favorable physicochemical properties of a&#8208;TCOs, a fluorescent TAMRA derivative in live HeLa cells was shown to be cell&#8208;permeable through intracellular Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry and to wash out more rapidly than other TCOs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade to Benzoxepins by Using Vinyl&#8208;Substituted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomerically enriched benzoxepins were synthesized from phosphonate&#8208;functionalized vinylcyclopropanes and salicylaldehydes by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening followed by Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons olefination and subsequent O&#8208;allylation (see scheme). In contrast to existing cycloaddition reactions of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, the two bonds are each formed in a separate event, thus allowing greater flexibility in reaction design.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade (4+3) cyclocondensation of salicylaldehydes and vinylcyclopropanes is reported. A key feature of the reaction is the use of a phosphonate group as an acceptor moiety on the cyclopropane, exploiting its propensity to undergo olefination with aldehydes. Subsequent O&#8208;allylation enabled the formation of a range of substituted benzoxepinsWith a novel chiral ligand, the products were obtained in generally good yield and with reasonable enantioselectivity.

         <title>Molecular Origin of Blood&#8208;Based Infrared Spectroscopic Fingerprints**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human biofluids provide systemic molecular information. By combining vibrational spectroscopy, biochemical fractionation, and mass spectroscopic proteomic profiling of blood serum, we extend the molecular understanding of the infrared spectral fingerprints of human blood. Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we provide a general framework informative for the future of disease probing.







Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy of liquid biopsies is a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective approach that may advance biomedical diagnostics. However, the molecular nature of disease&#8208;related changes of infrared molecular fingerprints (IMFs) remains poorly understood, impeding the method's applicability. Here we probe 148 human blood sera and reveal the origin of the variations in their IMFs. To that end, we supplemented infrared spectroscopy with biochemical fractionation and proteomic profiling, providing molecular information about serum composition. Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we demonstrate that the disease&#8208;related differences in IMFs are dominated by contributions from twelve highly abundant proteins&#8212;that, if used as a pattern, may be instrumental for detecting malignancy. Tying proteomic to spectral information and machine learning advances our understanding of the infrared spectra of liquid biopsies, a framework that could be applied to probing of any disease.

Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we provide a general framework informative for the future of disease probing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrared spectroscopy of liquid biopsies is a time- and cost-effective approach that may advance biomedical diagnostics. However, the molecular nature of disease-related changes of infrared molecular fingerprints (IMFs) remains poorly understood, impeding the method's applicability. Here we probe 148 human blood sera and reveal the origin of the variations in their IMFs. To that end, we supplemented infrared spectroscopy with biochemical fractionation and proteomic profiling, providing molecular information about serum composition. Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we demonstrate that the disease-related differences in IMFs are dominated by contributions from twelve highly abundant proteins&#8212;that, if used as a pattern, may be instrumental for detecting malignancy. Tying proteomic to spectral information and machine learning advances our understanding of the infrared spectra of liquid biopsies, a framework that could be applied to probing of any disease.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Evidence of Mars&#8208;Van&#8208;Krevelen Mechanism in the Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Ni&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry using a hanging droplet cell confirmed the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. This mechanism involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface and the electrolyte.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a crucial reaction for renewable energy conversion and storage. Among the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, NiFe based oxyhydroxides show the highest catalytic activity. However, the details of their OER mechanism are still unclear, due to the elusive nature of the OER intermediates. Here, using a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) cell interface, we performed isotope&#8208;labelling experiments in 18O&#8208;labelled aqueous alkaline electrolyte on Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. Our experiments confirm the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both catalysts to various degrees, which involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst and the electrolyte. The quantitative charge analysis suggests that the participating lattice oxygen atoms belong exclusively to the catalyst surface, confirming DFT computational hypotheses. Also, DEMS data suggest a fundamental correlation between the magnitude of the lattice oxygen mechanism and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen controlled by pseudocapacitive oxidative metal redox charges.

         <title>Single&#8208;Handed Double Helix and Spiral Platelet Formed by Racemate of Dissymmetric Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of dissymmetric cage DC&#8208;1 forms an unusual supramolecular double helix, which is composed of six racemic pairs of DC&#8208;1 per turn, and exhibits a single&#8208;handed helical sense. These single&#8208;handed helices with frustrated packing further assembled into hexagonal crystals with screw dislocation, which namely symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level.







Abstract
Spontaneous deracemization has been used to separate homochiral domains from the racemic system. However, homochirality can only be referred to when the scales of these domains and systems are specified. To clarify this, we report self&#8208;assembly of racemates of dissymmetric cages DC&#8208;1 with a cone&#8208;shape propeller geometry, forming a centrosymmetric columnar crystalline phase (racemic at crystallographic level). Owing to their anisotropic geometry, the two enantiomers are packed in a frustrated fashion in this crystalline phase; single&#8208;handed double helices are observed (single&#8208;handedness at supramolecular level). The frustrated packing (layer continuity break&#8208;up) in turn facilitates screw dislocation during the crystal growth, forming left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed spiral platelets (symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level), although each platelet is composed of DC&#8208;1 racemates. The symmetry correlation between DC&#8208;1 molecules, the crystalline phase and spiral platelets, all exhibit C3 symmetry.

         <title>Synthesis of Arylpalladium(II) Boronates: Confirming the Structure and Chemical Competence of Pre&#8208;transmetalation Intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II) boronates are fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction that are typically transient and have never been isolated. Arylpalladium(II) boronates have now been synthesized that are kinetically stable in solution, which enabled their isolation and crystallographic characterization. These species were shown to be chemically competent in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings.







Abstract
Palladium(II) boronates are recognized as fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. While these typically transient species have been detected and studied spectroscopically, it is conspicuous that they have never been isolated since this important reaction was discovered over forty years ago. This study reports the synthesis of a family of unprecedented arylpalladium(II) boronates that are, by design, kinetically stable at ambient temperature, both in solution and in the solid state. These properties enabled unambiguous crystallographic confirmation of their structure for the first time and their chemical competence in a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was demonstrated.

         <title>A Polarity&#8208;Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescence Probe for Monitoring Changes in Lipid Droplets and Nucleus during Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lipid droplet (LD)/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescence probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity change was developed. CQPP offers ratiometric fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging of LD polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model.







Abstract
Ferroptosis regulates cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;associated lipid peroxide accumulation, which is expected to affect the structure and polarity of lipid droplets (LDs), but with no clear evidence. Herein, we report the first example of an LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescent probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity changes in the cellular microenvironment. Due to the donor&#8211;acceptor structure of CQPP, it offers ratiometric fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime signals that reflect polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model. This LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe shows the great potential of using fluorescence imaging to study ferroptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Supercharging Prions via Amyloid&#8208;Selective Lysine Acetylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead compounds were designed to &#8220;supercharge&#8221; misfolded forms of proteins linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (i.e., superoxide dismutase&#8208;1; &#945;&#8208;synuclein). Compounds increased the net negative charge of amyloid fibrils via lysine peracetylation, with minimal to no modification of various proteins in their native state. Supercharged fibrils exhibited weaker seeding activity in vitro and in organotypic spinal cord.







Abstract
Repulsive electrostatic forces between prion&#8208;like proteins are a barrier against aggregation. In neuropharmacology, however, a prion's net charge (Z) is not a targeted parameter. Compounds that selectively boost prion Z remain unreported. Here, we synthesized compounds that amplified the negative charge of misfolded superoxide dismutase&#8208;1 (SOD1) by acetylating lysine&#8208;NH3+ in amyloid&#8208;SOD1, without acetylating native&#8208;SOD1. Compounds resembled a &#8220;ball and chain&#8221; mace: a rigid amyloid&#8208;binding &#8220;handle&#8221; (benzothiazole, stilbene, or styrylpyridine); an aryl ester &#8220;ball&#8221;; and a triethylene glycol chain connecting ball to handle. At stoichiometric excess, compounds acetylated up to 9 of 11 lysine per misfolded subunit (&#916;Zfibril=&#8722;8100 per 103 subunits). Acetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 seeded aggregation more slowly than unacetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 in vitro and organotypic spinal cord (these effects were partially due to compound binding). Compounds exhibited reactivity with other amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins (e.g., fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein was peracetylated; serum albumin was partially acetylated; carbonic anhydrase was largely unacetylated).

At stoichiometric excess, compounds acetylated up to 9 of 11 lysine per misfolded subunit (&#916;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;fibril&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;8100 per 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; subunits). Acetylated amyloid-SOD1 seeded aggregation more slowly than unacetylated amyloid-SOD1 in vitro and organotypic spinal cord (these effects were partially due to compound binding). Compounds exhibited reactivity with other amyloid and non-amyloid proteins (e.g., fibrillar &#945;-synuclein was peracetylated; serum albumin was partially acetylated; carbonic anhydrase was largely unacetylated).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hybrid Amyloid&#8208;Based Redox Hydrogel for Bioelectrocatalytic H2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid prion&#8208;forming domain was synthesized that is capable to undergo hierarchical self&#8208;assembly into single&#8208;stranded protein nanowires, nanofibers, and supramolecular redox hydrogels. This property enabled us to immobilize a [NiFeSe] hydrogenase within a water&#8208;swollen network of conductive nanofibers by a gentle non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking process while ensuring its wiring to carbon electrodes for electrocatalysis.







Abstract
An artificial amyloid&#8208;based redox hydrogel was designed for mediating electron transfer between a [NiFeSe] hydrogenase and an electrode. Starting from a mutated prion&#8208;forming domain of fungal protein HET&#8208;s, a hybrid redox protein containing a single benzyl methyl viologen moiety was synthesized. This protein was able to self&#8208;assemble into structurally homogenous nanofibrils. Molecular modeling confirmed that the redox groups are aligned along the fibril axis and are tethered to its core by a long, flexible polypeptide chain that allows close encounters between the fibril&#8208;bound oxidized or reduced redox groups. Redox hydrogel films capable of immobilizing the hydrogenase under mild conditions at the surface of carbon electrodes were obtained by a simple pH jump. In this way, bioelectrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 were fabricated that afforded catalytic current densities of up to 270&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with an overpotential of 0.33&#8197;V, under quiescent conditions at 45&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Isoreticular Crystallization of Highly Porous Cubic Covalent Organic Cage Compounds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoreticular porous materials are obtained after crystallization of cubic organic cages with varying alkyl chains at the edges. Nitrogen sorption measurements revealed exceptionally high surface areas up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volumes up to 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intricate three&#8208;dimensional array of alternating intrinsic and extrinsic pores remains intact upon solvent removal and pore sizes are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents.







Abstract
Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position. n&#8208;Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#8197;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence&#8211;Spin Label Probe for Visualization and Quantification of Target Molecules in Tissue by Multiplexed FLIM&#8211;EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;label synthetic platform for a functional dual fluorescence&#8211;spin label probe enables the non&#8208;destructive simultaneous quantification and visualization of molecules in biological tissue. Multiplexed FLIM and EPR spectroscopy avoids analytical inconsistencies between both techniques. Beside tissue applications, molecular spectroscopic studies of biomolecular conformation, structure, dynamics, and microenvironment are feasible.







Abstract
Simultaneous visualization and concentration quantification of molecules in biological tissue is an important though challenging goal. The advantages of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for visualization, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for quantification are complementary. Their combination in a multiplexed approach promises a successful but ambitious strategy because of spin label&#8208;mediated fluorescence quenching. Here, we solved this problem and present the molecular design of a dual label (DL) compound comprising a highly fluorescent dye together with an EPR spin probe, which also renders the fluorescence lifetime to be concentration sensitive. The DL can easily be coupled to the biomolecule of choice, enabling in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro applications. This novel approach paves the way for elegant studies ranging from fundamental biological investigations to preclinical drug research, as shown in proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle penetration experiments in human skin ex&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid duplex&#8211;quadruplex oligonucleotides comprised of multiple domains have not been yet properly investigated because of their structural complexity. A new method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source is introduced to investigate effects between multiple proximal DNA domains.







Abstract
Quadruplexes are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures essential for many cellular processes. Hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains are challenging to study with conventional biophysical methods due to their structural complexity. Here, we introduce a novel method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source designed to investigate interactions between proximal DNA domains. Thermal denaturation experiments were aimed to study unfolding of multi&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide constructs derived from biologically relevant structures and to identify unfolding intermediates. Using the TCnESI MS, we observed changes in Tm and thermodynamic characteristics of proximal DNA domains depending on the number of domains, their position, and order in a single experiment.

         <title>A High&#8208;Resolution View of the Coordination Environment in a Paramagnetic Metalloprotein from its Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A close look from a distance: Pseudocontact shifts depend on the magnetic susceptibility of the metal center, which in turn depends on the coordination geometry. We exploit these dependencies to obtain a detail view of metal coordination in a metalloprotein.







Abstract
Metalloproteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome of all organisms and their characterization is critical for both basic sciences and biomedical applications. A large portion of metalloproteins bind paramagnetic metal ions, and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy has been widely used in their structural characterization. However, the signals of nuclei in the immediate vicinity of the metal center are often broadened beyond detection. In this work, we show that it is possible to determine the coordination environment of the paramagnetic metal in the protein at a resolution inaccessible to other techniques. Taking the structure of a diamagnetic analogue as a starting point, a geometry optimization is carried out by fitting the pseudocontact shifts obtained from first principles quantum chemical calculations to the experimental ones.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size&#8208;exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high&#8208;performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm, M = Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (agM&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4  separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas separation membranes. The low viscosities not only allow us to hot&#8208;cast or hot&#8208;press the CP glasses into thin membranes within 5 min without sacrificing their selectivity and permeability, but also endow the resulted glass membranes with healing ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing an Acidic Microenvironment by MoS2&#160;in Heterogeneous Fenton Reaction for Pollutant Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions have been widely used in the environment, biology, life science and other fields, the sharp decrease in their activity under macroneutral conditions is still a large problem. This study reports a MoS2 cocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton (CoFe2O4/MoS2) system capable of sustainably degrading organic pollutants, such as phenol, in a macroneutral buffer solution. An acidic microenvironment in the slipping plane of CoFe2O4 is successfully constructed by chemically bonding with MoS2. This microenvironment is not affected by the surrounding pH, which ensures the stable circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+ on the surface of CoFe2O4/MoS2 under neutral or even alkaline conditions. Additionally, CoFe2O4/MoS2 always exposes "fresh" active sites for the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of 1O2, effectively inhibiting the production of iron sludge and enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants, even in actual wastewater. This work not only experimentally verifies the existence of an acidic microenvironment on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts for the first time but also eliminates the pH limitation of the Fenton reaction for pollutant remediation, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as Original Aryne Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are rare and unexplored hypervalent compounds. An efficient and mild protocol affords now a large panel of these hypervalent compounds, featuring reactivity complementary to that of the corresponding diaryl &#955;3&#8208;iodanes. Due to their high reactivity, metal&#8208;free meta&#8208;selective C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N coupling occurs through in situ aryne generation.







Abstract
Despite the widespread application of hypervalent iodines, the corresponding &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are less explored. Herein we report a general, safe, and high&#8208;yielding strategy to access cyclic diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes. These unique compounds feature reactivity that is appealing and complementary to that of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes, generating arynes under mild reaction conditions and in the presence of a weak base. Accordingly, formal meta&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N couplings may be achieved. Mechanistic studies unambiguously support the aryne generation mechanism.

The construction of novel halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) based on iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions is reported.







Abstract
Due to the fascinating structures and wide applications, porous materials with open frameworks have attracted more and more attentions. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (XOF&#8211;TPPE) was successfully designed and fabricated by iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between pyridyl groups and I+ for the first time. The formation of XOF&#8211;TPPE and its linear analogue was monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), IR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED). The structural model of XOF&#8211;TPPE was established based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data and theoretical simulations. Significantly, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), DLS and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy experiments suggested that XOF&#8211;TPPE still maintains a stable 2D framework structure in solutions. This research opens up a novel avenue for the development of organic frameworks materials, and may bring new promising applications for the field of porous materials.

         <title>Tailored Synthesis of Skeletally Diverse Stemona Alkaloids through Chemoselective Dyotropic Rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of multisubstituted chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones have been constructed in a predictable and controllable manner through chemoselective dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones involving alkyl, hydrogen, and aryl migration. These transformations enabled the tailored synthesis of a series of skeletally diverse Stemona alkaloids with high efficiency (see scheme).







Abstract
The collective synthesis of skeletally diverse Stemona alkaloids featuring tailored dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones as key elements is described. Specifically, three typical 5/7/5 tricyclic skeletons associated with stemoamide, tuberostemospiroline and parvistemonine were first accessed through chemoselective dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones involving alkyl, hydrogen, and aryl migration, respectively. By the rational manipulation of substrate structures and reaction conditions, these dyotropic rearrangements proceeded with excellent efficiency, good chemoselectivity and high stereospecificity. Furthermore, several polycyclic Stemona alkaloids, including saxorumamide, isosaxorumamide, stemonine and bisdehydroneostemoninine, were obtained from the aforementioned tricyclic skeletons through late&#8208;stage derivatizations. A novel visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition was also developed, which offers a valuable tool for accessing oxaspirobutenolide and related scaffolds.

         <title>Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters as Model Catalysts for Identifying Active Sites for Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active sites for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO were experimentally identified for the first time using atomically well&#8208;defined Au nanoclusters. The partially dethiolated Au site bridging S and Au atoms in the staple motif exhibits higher charge density and upshift of d&#8208;states, which promote the catalytic process by stabilizing the reaction intermediate.







Abstract
Accurate identification of active sites is critical for elucidating catalytic reaction mechanisms and developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the atomic&#8208;level identification of active sites using atomically well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) Au25, Au38, and Au144 as model catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The studied Au NCs exhibited remarkably high CO2RR activity, which increased with increasing NC size. Electrochemical and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the Au NCs were activated by removing one thiolate group from each staple motif at the beginning of CO2RR. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed higher charge densities and upshifts of d&#8208;states for dethiolated Au sites. The structure&#8211;activity properties of the studied Au NCs confirmed that dethiolated Au sites were the active sites and that CO2RR activity was determined by the number of active sites on the cluster surface.

&lt;p&gt;Active sites for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO were experimentally identified for the first time using atomically well-defined Au nanoclusters. The partially dethiolated Au site bridging S and Au atoms in the staple motif exhibits higher charge density and upshift of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-states, which promote the catalytic process by stabilizing the reaction intermediate.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Robust Gold Nanocluster Protected with Amidinates for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first all&#8208;amidinate&#8208;supported gold nanocluster Au28 have been synthesized and structurally resolved. This cluster is quite robust manifested by the fact that it can stay intact in solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;d and maintain high FE(CO)s and activity over 40&#8197;hour operation for electroreduction of CO2. The strong gold&#8211;ligand binding and geometric closure account for the superior stability of Au28.







Abstract
The first all&#8208;amidinate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(Ph&#8722;form)12](OTf)2 (Ph&#8208;form=N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate) (Au28) has been synthesized and structurally resolved. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that Au28 has a compact Au4@Au24 tetrahedral core&#8211;shell structure of T symmetry, which is fully protected by 12 bridging formamidinate ligands. This cluster is quite robust as indicated by the fact that it can stay intact in solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;d. It exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with 96.5&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.57&#8197;V and a maximum TOF of 1731&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V. Its superior stability is also manifested in the fact that the supported catalyst Au28/CNTs maintains stable potentials at ca. &#8722;0.69&#8197;V for 40&#8197;h with FE(CO)s&gt;91&#8201;%. A superatomic electron configuration of 1S21P62S21D4 has been clarified by DFT computations, and the strong gold&#8211;ligand binding and geometric shell closure account for the superior stability of Au28.

         <title>Efficient Intramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Fluorophores Based on Substituted Triphenylphosphine Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent phosphorus is considered as new electron&#8208;donating species for intramolecular charge transfer fluorophores. The efficient triphenylphosphine&#8208;based emitters with excellent electrochemical stability and small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting afford potentials for luminescence&#8208;based applications and devices.







Abstract
Triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;based luminescent compounds are rarely investigated because of the low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we demonstrate that introducing steric hindrance groups to the TPP moiety and separating the orbitals involved in the transition can drastically suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay induced by structural distortion of TPP in the excited state. High PLQY up to 0.89 as well as thermally activated delayed fluorescence are observed from the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) molecules with substituted TPP donors (sTPPs) in doped films. The red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve comparable external quantum efficiencies to the control device containing a classical phosphorescent dye, revealing the great potential of the ICT emitters based on electrochemically stable sTPPs.

         <title>A Cooperatively Activatable, DNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Reporter for Imaging of Correlated Enzymatic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter operated orthogonally by the two enzymes, telomerase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, enables the imaging of their correlated activity both in vitro and in vivo. The system was further applied to specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy and analysis of the dual enzymatic activities during drug treatment.







Abstract
The dynamic variation of the expression profile and spatial landscape of multiple enzymes are crucial factors influencing tumor progression and drug treatment. However, the comprehensive analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of existing imaging technologies. Here we report a cooperatively activatable, DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter programmed to detect the correlated activity of dual enzymes, telomerase (TE) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), both in vitro and in vivo. The conformational change of the DNA probe can be orthogonally triggered through TE&#8208;induced DNA elongation and APE1&#8208;mediated specific cleavage, producing a fluorescent signal for imaging the activity of the two enzymes in an AND&#8208;gated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the system for specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy, and visualizing the correlated enzymatic activities during drug treatment of cancer.

         <title>Thermosensitive Vesicles from Chemically Encoded Lipid&#8208;Grafted Elastin&#8208;like Polypeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;sensitive lipo&#8208;proteinosomes were engineered by grafting lipids onto temperature&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs). Maintained at 37&#8201;&#176;C, folded ELP loops on the internal/external surface of the biohybrid membrane prevents the leaching of encapsulated molecules, while cooling of the dispersion induces a burst release, in correlation with the decompaction of ELP chains.







Abstract
Biomimetic design to afford smart functional biomaterials with exquisite properties represents synthetic challenges and provides unique perspectives. In this context, elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) recently became highly attractive building blocks in the development of lipoprotein&#8208;based membranes. In addition to the bioengineered post&#8208;translational modifications of genetically encoded recombinant ELPs developed so far, we report here a simple and versatile method to design biohybrid brush&#8208;like lipid&#8208;grafted&#8208;ELPs using chemical post&#8208;modification reactions. We have explored a combination of methionine alkylation and click chemistry to create a new class of hybrid lipoprotein mimics. Our design allowed the formation of biomimetic vesicles with controlled permeability, correlated to the temperature&#8208;responsiveness of ELPs.

         <title>Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution of Crystalline 3d&#8208;Transition Metal Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activities for oxygen evolution on crystalline 3d transition metal layered double hydroxides are derived using electrochemical surface area based normalization. Density functional calculations reveal a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;site feature of the reaction centers that provides opportunities to design new catalysts with improved performance.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are among the most active and studied catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. However, previous studies have generally either focused on a small number of LDHs, applied synthetic routes with limited structural control, or used non&#8208;intrinsic activity metrics, thus hampering the construction of consistent structure&#8211;activity&#8208;relations. Herein, by employing new individually developed synthesis strategies with atomic structural control, we obtained a broad series of crystalline &#945;&#8208;MA(II)MB(III) LDH and &#946;&#8208;MA(OH)2 electrocatalysts (MA=Ni, Co, and MB=Co, Fe, Mn). We further derived their intrinsic activity through electrochemical active surface area normalization, yielding the trend NiFe LDH &gt; CoFe LDH &gt; Fe&#8208;free Co&#8208;containing catalysts &gt; Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Our theoretical reactivity analysis revealed that these intrinsic activity trends originate from the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;site nature of the reaction centers, which lead to composition&#8208;dependent synergies and diverse scaling relationships that may be used to design catalysts with improved performance.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic activities for oxygen evolution on crystalline 3d transition metal layered double hydroxides are derived using electrochemical surface area based normalization. Density functional calculations reveal a dual-metal-site feature of the reaction centers that provides opportunities to design new catalysts with improved performance.

         <title>Highly Controlled Janus Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as a Versatile Photoacoustic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the structural order of nanoparticles (NPs), morphology, and composition is of paramount significance in tailoring the physical properties of nanoassembly. However, the commonly reported symmetrical nanocomposites often suffer an interference or sacrifice of the photophysical properties of the original components. To address this challenge, we developed a novel type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of components, combined modular optical properties, and independent stimuli. As a proof of concept, JNCPs were prepared by incorporating two photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents, namely an organic semiconducting dye and responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNP) assembly in separate compartments of JNCP. Theoretical simulation results confirmed that the formation mechanism of JNCPs arises from the entropy equilibrium in the system. The AuNP assembly generated a PA images with the variation of pH, while semiconducting molecule served as an internal PA standard agent, leading to ratiometric PA imaging of pH. JNCP based probe holds great potential for real&#8208;time and accurate detection of diverse biological targets in living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Intrablock Crosslinking of Linear Diblock Copolymer to Realize Janus&#8208;shaped Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape&#8208;defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one&#8208;shot intrablock crosslinking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (i.e., Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene&#8208;  block  &#8208;poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self&#8208;folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one&#8208;shot intrablock crosslinking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. We further discovered the excellent self&#8208;assembling behavior of the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP to produce miniscule microphase&#8208;separated structures, representing the significant potential of the presented compartmentalization protocol, for developing biomimetic synthetic&#8208;systems, as well as for industrial nanofabrication applications.</dc:description>

         <title>CaMn3IVO4 Cubane Models of the Oxygen Evolving Complex: Spin Ground States S &lt; 9/2 and the Effect of Oxo Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn3IVO4 and YMn3IVO4 complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the OEC. The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on spin state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn3IVO4 complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be S = 9/2. Desymmetrization of the pseudo&#8208;C3 symmetric Ca(Y)Mn3IVO4 core leads to a lower S = 5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an S = 3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn3IVO3(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low spin and high spin forms of the S2 state is pH dependent, suggesting that (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin state changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization&#8208;Induced Nanoassemblies for Self&#8208;Augmented Cascade Chemotherapy and Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical application of chemodynamic therapy is impeded by the insufficient intracellular H  2  O  2  level in tumour tissues. Herein, we developed a supramolecular nanoparticle  via  a simple one&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly process using platinum (IV) complex&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;ferrocene conjugates as supramolecular monomers. The supramolecular nanoparticles could dissociate rapidly upon exposure to endogenous H  2  O  2  in the tumour and release hydroxyl radicals as well as platinum (IV) prodrugs  in situ  , which is reduced into cisplatin to significantly promote the generation of H  2  O  2  in the tumour tissue. Thus, the supramolecular nanomedicine overcomes the limitation of conventional chemodynamic therapy  via  the self&#8208;augmented cascade radical generation and drug release. In addition, the dissociated supramolecular nanoparticles could be readily excreted from the body  via  renal clearance to effectively avoid systemic toxicity and ensure long term biocompatibility of the nanomedicine. This work may provide new insights on the design and development of novel supramolecular nanoassemblies for cascade chemo/chemodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Unsymmetrical Coordinated Cyclophane Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophane structures can control steric pressure in the otherwise open spaces of square&#8208;planar d  8  &#8208;metal catalysts. This elegant concept was so far limited to symmetrical coordinated metals. We report how a cyclophane motif can be generated in ligands that chelate via two different donors. An ancillary second imine in the versatile &#954;  2  &#8208;  N,O  &#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure via olefin metathesis and selective double bond hydrogenation to yield a 30&#8208;membered ring efficiently. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the ancillary imine is directed away from the active site and inert for catalysis. In ethylene polymerization the cyclophane catalyst is more active and temperature stable  vs  . an open structure reference, notably also in polar solvents. Increased molecular weights and decreased degrees of branching can be traced to an increased energy of sterically demanding transition states by the encircling cyclophane while chain propagation remains highly efficient.</dc:description>

         <title>Be2(BO3)(IO3): The First Anion&#8208;mixed Van der Waals Member in KBe2BO3F2 Family with Very Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To obtain new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with a large second harmonic generation (SHG) effect has always been a great challenge. Herein, the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal, Be 2  (BO 3  )(IO 3  ) (BBIO), was synthesized by ingenious multi&#8208;component modification of KBe 2  BO 3  F 2  (KBBF), in which the structural features of KBBF was maintained and (IO 3  ) &#8208;  groups were connected to honeycomb [Be 2  BO 3  O 2  ] &#8734;  layers. As the first KBBF family member with mixed anionic groups, BBIO benefited from the synergistic effect of (IO 3  ) &#8208;  , (BO 3  ) 3&#8208;  and (BeO 4  ) 6&#8208;  groups, and exhibited a very strong SHG response of ~7.2 &#215; KH 2  PO 4  (KDP, @1064 nm) and a large birefringence (&#916;n) of 0.172 at 1064 nm. Besides, BBIO unexpectedly showed the potential ability to optimize growth habits via  van der Waals force. This study not only showed borate&#8208;iodate as a new excellent NLO material, but also provided enormous opportunities in KBBF structural engineering.</dc:description>

Herein, the first metal borate-iodate NLO crystal, Be 2  (BO 3  )(IO 3  ) (BBIO), was synthesized by ingenious multi-component modification of KBe 2  BO 3  F 2  (KBBF), in which the structural features of KBBF was maintained and (IO 3  ) -  groups were connected to honeycomb [Be 2  BO 3  O 2  ] &#8734;  layers. As the first KBBF family member with mixed anionic groups, BBIO benefited from the synergistic effect of (IO 3  ) -  , (BO 3  ) 3-  and (BeO 4  ) 6-  groups, and exhibited a very strong SHG response of ~7.2 &#215; KH 2  PO 4  (KDP, @1064 nm) and a large birefringence (&#916;n) of 0.172 at 1064 nm. Besides, BBIO unexpectedly showed the potential ability to optimize growth habits via  van der Waals force. This study not only showed borate-iodate as a new excellent NLO material, but also provided enormous opportunities in KBBF structural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel TiSe2&#8208;Graphite Dual Ion Battery: Fast Na&#8208;Ion Insertion and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sodium dual ion battery (Na&#8208;DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a novel Na&#8208;DIB based on TiSe2&#8208;graphite is reported for the first time. The unprecedentedly high diffusion coefficient of Na&#8208;ions (3.21 &#215; 10&#8208;11 &#8208; 1.20 &#215; 10&#8208;9 cm2 s&#8208;1) and the very low Na&#8208;ion diffusion barrier (0.50 eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems. In&#8208;situ investigations reveal that the fast Na&#8208;ion diffusion involves four insertion stage compositions. The prototype cell of novel and low&#8208;cost TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB shows a reversible capacity of 81.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at current density of 100 mA g&#8208;1, an excellent stability with 83.52% capacity retention over 200 cycles and excellent rate performance, suggesting its high potential for next&#8208;generation large scale high&#8208;performance stationary energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported an ultrapure blue multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield and a large rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing. Because of restricted pai&#8208;conjugation of the HOMO rather than the LUMO induced by oxygen atom incorporation, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me shows a hypsochromic shift compared to the parent MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with metal oxide backbones is a grand challenge in materials design, as it could give unique control over the resulting chemical properties. Here, we report a 1D&#8208;organo&#8208;functionalized polyoxometalate polymer featuring a purely inorganic backbone. The polymer is self&#8208;assembled from two types of monomers, inorganic Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates and aromatic organo&#8208;boronates. Their covalent linkage results in 1D polymer strands, which combine an inorganic oxide backbone (based on B&#8208;O and Nb&#8208;O linkages) with functional organic side&#8208;chains. The polymer shows high bulk proton conductivity of up to 1.59 &#10799; 10&#8208;1 S cm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C and 98 % relative humidity. This synthetic approach could lead to a new class of organic&#8208;inorganic polymers where function can be designed by controlled tuning of the monomer units.</dc:description>

         <title>Threefold Collaborative Stabilization of Ag14&#8208;Nanorods by Hydrophobic Ti16&#8208;Oxo Clusters and Alkynes: Designable Assembly and Solid&#8208;State Optical&#8208;Limiting Application</title>

An Ag cluster is protected by a combination of hydrophobic organic fluorinated ligands, an inorganic Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne caps, which results in a novel Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring core&#8211;shell nanocluster. This well protected cluster exhibits superhydrophobicity, excellent ambient stability, and unprecedented solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristic.







Abstract
Ag nanoclusters have received increasing attention due to their atomically precise and diverse structures and intriguing optical properties. Nevertheless, the inherent instability of Ag nanoclusters has seriously hindered their practical application. In this work, for the first time, Ag clusters are collaboratively protected by hydrophobic Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and alkyne ligands. Initially, a pyramidal Ag5 cluster terminated with tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; and CH3CN was inserted into the cavity of a Ti8&#8208;oxo nanoring to form Ag5@Ti8. To overcome the instability of acetonitrile&#8208;terminated silver site, such two Ag5@Ti8 clusters could sandwich an Ag4 unit to form Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring (Ag14@Ti16), which is peripherally protected by fluorophenyl groups and alkyne caps. This threefold protected (hydrophobic fluorinated organic layer, Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne ligands) Ag14@Ti16 exhibits superhydrophobicity and excellent ambient stability, endowing it with solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristics.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13029-13034, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 50&#8197;years after the birth of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET), the first experimental evidence of the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance was achieved using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active micelles.







Abstract
Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.

         <title>The Boundary of Lithium Plating in Graphite Electrode for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The boundary of Li plating in a graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries is defined. The cell with regulated Li plating exhibits highly reversible Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.5&#8201;% with superior safety performance, offering a strategy to achieve safe high&#8208;energy fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Uncontrolled Li plating in graphite electrodes endangers battery life and safety, driving tremendous efforts aiming to eliminate Li plating. Herein we systematically investigate the boundary of Li plating in graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The cell exhibits superior safety performance than that with Li dendrites by defining the endurable amount of uniform Li plating in graphite anode. The presence of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; can be eliminated owing to the uniform distribution of Li plating, and the average Coulombic efficiency for deposited Li during reversible plating/stripping process is decoupled as high as about 99.5&#8201;%. Attributing to the limited Li plating with superior Coulombic efficiency, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite cell achieves a high capacity retention of 80.2&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This work sheds a different light on further improving the fast&#8208;charging capability, low&#8208;temperature performance, and energy density of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Surface Ligands Reactivity of Metal Clusters by Bulky Ligands for Controlling Optical and Chiral Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12897-12903, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky surface ligands greatly enhance the surface ligands reactivity of metal clusters, allowing easy modulation of their optical properties by reversible surface ligation. When chiral amines are introduced into the solution of racemic clusters, they are readily converted in full to optically pure homochiral clusters.







Abstract
Surface ligands play critical roles in determining the surface properties of metal clusters. However, modulating the properties and controlling the surface structure of clusters through surface&#8208;capping&#8208;agent displacement is challenging. Herein, [Ag14(SPh(CF3)2)12(PPh3)4(DMF)4] (Ag14&#8208;DMF; DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide), with weakly coordinated DMF ligands on surface silver sites, was synthesized by a mixed&#8208;ligands strategy. Owing to the high surface reactivity of Ag14&#8208;DMF, the surface ligands are labile, easily dissociated or exchanged by other ligands. Based on the enhanced surface reactivity, easy modulation of the optical properties of Ag14 by reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; DMF ligation was realized. When chiral amines were introduced to as&#8208;prepared products, all eight surface ligands were replaced by amines and the racemic Ag14 clusters were converted to optically pure homochiral Ag14 clusters as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) activity and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). This work provides a new insight into modulation of the optical properties of metal clusters and atomically precise homochiral clusters for specific applications are obtained.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Porous Ionic Liquids for Low&#8208;Pressure CO2 Capture**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12876-12882, June 1, 2021. </description>

Porous ionic liquids based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts were prepared. These show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103&#8201;% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 at 1&#8197;bar and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Porous ionic liquids are non&#8208;volatile, versatile materials that associate porosity and fluidity. New porous ionic liquids, based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts, were prepared and show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103&#8201;% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 at 1&#8197;bar and 303&#8197;K. We show how the rational combination of MOFs with ionic liquids can greatly enhance low pressure CO2 absorption, paving the way towards a new generation of high&#8208;performance, readily available liquid materials for effective low pressure carbon capture.

         <title>In Vivo Subcellular Mass Spectrometry Enables Proteo&#8208;Metabolomic Single&#8208;Cell Systems Biology in a Chordate Embryo Developing to a Normally Behaving Tadpole (X. laevis)**
</title>

Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry was advanced to enable dual characterization of proteins and metabolites in identified cells in Xenopus laevis embryos. The analyzed embryos developed to normally behaving tadpoles with anatomy and visual function indistinguishable from that of their control siblings in a background color preference assay. In vivo single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry expands the analytical toolbox of molecular systems, cell, and developmental biology.







Abstract
We report the development of in vivo subcellular high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for proteo&#8208;metabolomic molecular systems biology in complex tissues. With light microscopy, we identified the left&#8208;dorsal and left&#8208;ventral animal cells in cleavage&#8208;stage non&#8208;sentient Xenopus laevis embryos. Using precision&#8208;translated fabricated microcapillaries, the subcellular content of each cell was double&#8208;probed, each time swiftly (&lt;5&#8197;s/event) aspirating &lt;5&#8201;% of cell volume (&#8776;10&#8197;nL). The proteins and metabolites were analyzed by home&#8208;built ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization employing orbitrap or time&#8208;of&#8208;flight HRMS. Label&#8208;free detection of &#8776;150 metabolites (57 identified) and 738 proteins found proteo&#8208;metabolomic networks with differential quantitative activities between the cell types. With spatially and temporally scalable sampling, the technology preserved the integrity of the analyzed cells, the neighboring cells, and the embryo. 95&#8201;% of the analyzed embryos developed into sentient tadpoles that were indistinguishable from their wild&#8208;type siblings based on anatomy and visual function in a background color preference assay.

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13081-13088, June 1, 2021. </description>

We first demonstrate the deliberate introduction of defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be an additional degree of freedom towards highly permselective MOF/polymer mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs). The developed MMM materials based on our concept exhibit promising potential for industrial propylene/propane separation processes as well as universal applicability in other fields.







Abstract
Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy&#8208;efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler&#8208;matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of &#8220;defect engineering&#8221; in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect&#8208;engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed&#8208;gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.

&lt;p&gt;We first demonstrate the deliberate introduction of defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be an additional degree of freedom towards highly permselective MOF/polymer mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). The developed MMM materials based on our concept exhibit promising potential for industrial propylene/propane separation processes as well as universal applicability in other fields.

         <title>Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering Studies of Block Copolymer Nano&#8208;Objects: Formation of Ordered Phases in Concentrated Solution During Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can produce lyotropic phases of block copolymer nano&#8208;objects. Time&#8208;resolved SAXS studies confirm that reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate in n&#8208;dodecane initially produces spheres exhibiting long&#8208;range order that subsequently evolve to form hexagonally packed worms. Serial dilution leads to disordered worms.







Abstract
We report that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be used to prepare lyotropic phases comprising diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects in non&#8208;polar media. RAFT dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) at 90&#8201;&#176;C using a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped hydrogenated polybutadiene (PhBD) steric stabilizer block in n&#8208;dodecane produces either spheres or worms that exhibit long&#8208;range order at 40&#8201;% w/w solids. NMR studies enable calculation of instantaneous copolymer compositions for each phase during the BzMA polymerization. As the PBzMA chains grow longer when targeting PhBD80&#8211;PBzMA40, time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals intermediate body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonally close&#8208;packed (HCP) sphere phases prior to formation of a final hexagonal cylinder phase (HEX). The HEX phase is lost on serial dilution and the aligned cylinders eventually form disordered flexible worms. The HEX phase undergoes an order&#8211;disorder transition on heating to 150&#8201;&#176;C and a pure HCP phase forms on cooling to 20&#8201;&#176;C.

We report the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that can re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments.







Abstract
Nature uses non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve structural dynamic reconfiguration of biopolymers. Taking advantage of the programmability of DNA/DNA interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured by external inputs. The different tiles share the same sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands. We show that by sequentially adding specific inputs it is possible to re&#8208;organize the formed structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers, random and block structures. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.

Starting from fluoren[3]arenes, a new kind of easily available macrocyclic arenes, a powerful approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) with aesthetic conjugated belt structures was developed.

Abstract
An approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) from fluoren[3]arenes (F[3]As) was developed. Consequently, F[3]As as a new kind of macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. Followed by the demethylation, triflation and intramolecular aryl&#8211;aryl coupling reactions, C[6]CPPs were then conveniently obtained. Interestingly, C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives. The crystal structures showed the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted F[3]As had bowl&#8208;shaped conformations, and the C[6]CPPs exhibited rigid belt&#8208;shaped structures with deep cavities. Moreover, C[6]CPPs exhibited high HOMO energies and narrow energy gaps. An unclosed belt was further obtained, and it not only showed a similar narrow energy gap to those of the aromatic belts, but also displayed strong fluorescence property, which can play a vital role in the design and synthesis of new aromatic belts.

         <title>Designing Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte and Fully Infiltrated 3D Electrode for Integrated Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

A PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature and a solid&#8208;state lithium battery (SSLB) with 3D fully infiltration of PISSE is developed. The integrated device achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, presenting high performance close to that with liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are promising owing to enhanced safety and high energy density but plagued by the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes and large electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfacial resistance. Herein, we design a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and construct a model integrated TiO2/Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li+ transport than common polymer electrolytes. The integrated device achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, with performance close to liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7&#8197;V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin&#8208;film batteries.

Herein, we design a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)-based polymer-in-salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room-temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and construct a model integrated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport than common polymer electrolytes. The integrated device achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, with performance close to liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7&#8197;V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin-film batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

Hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) poses a severe threat to public health and social development. Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleave HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively block HBV assembly and prevent HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) poses a severe threat to public health and social development. Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleavage HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively blocked HBV assembly and prevented HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm. Experimental analysis showed that the chiral Cu2S NPs specific bound with the functional domain from phenylalanine23 (F23) to leucine30 (L30) from HBcAg primary sequence and the cutting site was between amino acid residues F24 and proline25 (P25). Under excitation at 808&#8197;nm, the intracellular HBcAg concentration was reduced by 95&#8201;%, and in HBV transgenic mice, the levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA were decreased by 93&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Together, these results reveal the potential nanomedicine for HBV control and provide fresh tools for viral infection.

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Thebainone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13057-13064, June 1, 2021. </description>

A deconstructive strategy involving the cleavage of relatively inert C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to build more complex scaffolds enabled the total synthesis of morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A in 13 (and 14) steps from commercially available starting materials (see scheme). The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboacylation reaction was applied successfully to the construction of various polycyclic skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A, capitalizing on an enantioselective C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaction. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8220;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8221; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allowed efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, we completed the synthesis of the morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A by two complementary routes.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Potassium&#8208;Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for High Power Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) was prepared by a facile co&#8208;precipitation method. The KNiHCF//graphite full cell exhibits high rate performance, superior cycling stability, and high power density. This work would offer an insight into design of the low&#8208;strain cathode materials for PIBs.







Abstract
Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K+, resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high discharge voltage of 3.82&#8197;V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention of 88.6&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. The superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. The high power density and long&#8208;term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell confirmed the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work provides guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for PIBs.

         <title>In Vivo X&#8208;ray Triggered Catalysis of H2 Generation for Cancer Synergistic Gas Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12868-12875, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable in situ H2 production platform, Au NRs&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A (Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS) was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy triggered by X&#8208;rays. The mechanism of hydrogen production under X&#8208;ray excitation is quite different from that under visible light because of the heterojunction structure of Au NRs&#8208;amorphous TiO2.







Abstract
To date, hydrogen (H2) therapy has received widespread attention. However, X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable H2&#8208;producing materials with controlled release for cancer treatment have not been reported. Herein, an X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable in situ H2 producing platform, Au NR&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A(Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS), composed of Au&#8208;amorphous TiO2 nano&#8208;dumbbell&#8208;shaped heterostructure coated with long afterglow particles, was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy. The mechanism of H2 production was verified by theoretical calculations and in vitro experiments. Changes in the apoptosis pathway caused by the synergistic effect of H2 and radiotherapy were reported. Guided by its excellent photoacoustic imaging capabilities, mice with orthotopic liver cancer achieved excellent therapeutic effects and low inflammatory side effects, suggesting that Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS has promising application potential for cancer treatment and prognosis.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Mediated Energy Transfer in Heterojunction Enables Infrared Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12891-12896, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under infrared&#8208;light irradiation, black phosphorus (BP) is directly excited, and energy could be nonradiatively transferred to CN by exciton interactions. The indirectly generated excitons in CN would be dissociated into free electrons and holes at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by the injection of holes to BP and the accumulation of electrons in CN.







Abstract
Although a few semiconductors can directly absorb infrared light, their intrinsic properties like improper band&#8208;edge position and strong electron&#8211;hole interaction restrict further photocatalytic applications. Herein, we propose an exciton&#8208;mediated energy transfer strategy for realizing efficient infrared light response in heterostructures. Using black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction, CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8211;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light irradiation. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.

         <title>Design of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>

Benefiting from a sacrificial Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O insulating layer, a Zn&#8208;ion conductive and waterproof fluorine solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed in situ for highly reversible Zn plating/stripping in low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolytes. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700&#8197;cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2 electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bilayer SEI, where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. We found that the insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O layer is first formed on the Zn anode surface by the self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8722; with Zn2+ and OH&#8722; generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6, which in turn promotes the formation of ZnF2 as the inner layer. The organic&#8208;dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8722;. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700 cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells with a low Zn/MnO2 capacity ratio of 2:1.

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12941-12948, June 1, 2021. </description>

A potent method is offered for accessing the dynamics of biomolecules and detecting miRNA at the single&#8208;molecule level in the time range from &#956;s to ms, tracing the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics between a fluorescent molecule and cyclooctatetraene (COT) by monitoring the fluorescence blinking.







Abstract
To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is about 106 times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8211;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. The present method is thus a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.

         <title>Ultrafast and Stable Proton Conduction in Polybenzimidazole Covalent Organic Frameworks via Confinement and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12918-12923, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensing benzimidazole units via topology&#8208;directed polymerization allows the construction of stable covalent organic frameworks with ordered one&#8208;dimensional channels. The walls trigger multiple hierarchical interactions so that the proton networks are locked in the pores via spatial confinement and activated via deprotonation. Ultrafast and stable anhydrous proton conduction is achieved over a wide range of temperatures.







Abstract
Polybenzimidazoles are engineering plastics with superb thermal stability and this specificity has sparked a wide&#8208;ranging research to explore proton&#8208;conducting materials. Nevertheless, such materials encounter challenging issues owing to phosphoric acid proton carrier leakage and slow proton transport. We report a strategy for designing porous polybenzimidazole frameworks to address these key fundamental issues. The built&#8208;in channels are designed to be one&#8208;dimensionally extended, unidirectionally aligned, and fully occupied by neat phosphoric acid, while the benzimidazole walls trigger multipoint, multichain, and multitype interactions to spatially confine a phosphoric acid network in pores and facilitate proton conduction via deprotonation. The materials exhibit ultrafast and stable proton conduction for low proton carrier content and activation energy&#8212;a set of features highly desired for proton transport. Our results offer a design strategy for the fabrication of porous polybenzimidazoles for use in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Crystal Packing&#8208;Guided Construction of Hetero&#8208;Oligomeric Peptidic Ensembles as Synthetic 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 Transporters</title>

We present a broadly applicable social self&#8208;sorting strategy, enabling cation&#8208;binding crown ether groups and anion&#8208;binding fluorobenzene groups to be alternatively packed. This generates a 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 transporter system, promoting transmembrane transport of cations, anions, and zwitterionic species such as amino acids.







Abstract
Strategies to generate heteromeric peptidic ensembles via a social self&#8208;sorting process are limited. Herein, we report a crystal packing&#8208;inspired social self&#8208;sorting strategy broadly applicable to diverse types of H&#8208;bonded peptidic frameworks. Specifically, a crystal structure of H&#8208;bonded alkyl chain&#8208;appended monopeptides reveals an inter&#8208;chain separation distance of 4.8&#8197;&#197; dictated by the H&#8208;bonded amide groups, which is larger than 4.1&#8197;&#197; separation distance desired by the tightly packed straight alkyl chains. This incompatibility results in loosely packed alkyl chains, prompting us to investigate and validate the feasibility of applying bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups, modified with an anion&#8208;binding group, to alternatively interpenetrate the straight alkyl chains, modified with a crown ether group. Structurally, this social self&#8208;sorting approach generates highly stable hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles, having alternated anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;binding units vertically aligned to the same side. Functionally, these hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles promote transmembrane transport of cations, anions and more interestingly zwitterionic species such as amino acids.

Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, assembled the cage&#8208;shaped sarpagine scaffold. By late&#8208;stage diversifications of the ketone and allene groups, a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of two classes of indole alkaloids including five sarpagine alkaloids and three koumine alkaloids has been accomplished.







Abstract
We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine&#8197;B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive 9&#8208;Carbene&#8208;9&#8208;Borafluorene Monoanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13065-13072, June 1, 2021. </description>

The first examples of 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanions are isolated. In addition to complete characterization via X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, the nucleophilic character of the boryl anions is supported by DFT calculations and probed experimentally via reactions with metal halides and diketones.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of carbene&#8208;supported 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorenes with excess KC8, Na, or Li&#8208;naphthalenide affords six N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208; or cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borafluorene anions (3&#8211;8)&#8208;the first isolated and structurally authenticated examples of the elusive 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion. The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds 5 and 8 react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8208;E (E=Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (9&#8211;12). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from 5 or 8 to yield new B&#8208;O containing spirocycles (13&#8211;14) that cannot be easily obtained using &#8220;normal&#8221; valent borafluorene compounds. Collectively, these results support the notion that carbene&#8208;stabilized monoanionic borafluorenes may serve as a new platform for the one&#8208;step construction of higher&#8208;value boracyclic materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12971-12979, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) with dual peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities induces ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this way Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT can be used against malignant tumors.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues near tumors, and the damage to cancer cells caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing the damage to healthy tissues simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperatures is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported: ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economical utilization of catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Freezing&#8208;Assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>

Upon freezing, unmodified diblock DNAs containing an A5 block react with acrylic monomers in a freezing radical polymerization condition. This allows covalent conjugation to hydrogel nanoparticles and monoliths with an efficiency comparable to acrydite&#8208;modified DNA.







Abstract
Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75&#8201;% conjugation efficiency in 8&#8197;h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50&#8197;pM and 10&#8197;nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.

Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;triggered ROS amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0.







Abstract
Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Herein, we present a new strategy for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of cancer cells/tissues based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone (&#946;&#8208;Lap, an anticancer agent) triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues. With the strategy, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe PSiR3 developed in this work with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0. What's more, the strategy allowed the fluorescence discrimination of tumor tissues from inflammatory ones based on whether a marked fluorescence enhancement could be induced when treated with PSiR3 and &#946;&#8208;Lap/PSiR3 combination, respectively.

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12883-12890, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many paired electrochemical reactions use perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, but this matching is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. Oxidation reactions were paired with H2 generation, showing the generality of the anodic process. This effort was followed by pairing multiple cathodic reactions with a pair of established oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Paired electrochemical reactions allow the optimization of both atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. In principle, any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode, showing the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. This is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis to complete the picture and illustrate how oxidation and reduction reactions can be combined.

         <title>Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12904-12910, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chemical synthesis of homogeneous glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) has been accomplished via the combination of protein and carbohydrate chemistry. This strategy provides a versatile synthetic platform for homogeneous glycosylated RBDs of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein and other related virus proteins and a powerful tool for investigating the functions of RBD glycans.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD&#8208;based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331, and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to decipher carbohydrate structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13042-13049, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay is achieved by inner filter effect&#8208;mediated double&#8208;signal&#8208;reverse change, which not only enables highly sensitive quantitative analysis by combing with the smartphone platform, but also allows the visual readout of H&#8208;FABP concentration by the naked eye. The developed strip can be used for rapid and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of acute myocardial infarction.







Abstract
We report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of acute myocardial infarction biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye.

         <title>Nitrone and Alkyne Cascade Reactions for Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective 1&#8208;Pyrroline Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13089-13097, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1] cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been developed for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. This transformation provides a distinct disconnection strategy to access these heterocycles in comparison to traditional approaches. The scope, tolerance, and utility of the method are discussed, and mechanistic studies are examined to better understand reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
The synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and N&#8208;alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8242;]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with N&#8208;alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo&#8208; and regioisomeric preferences of the 1&#8208;pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.

This transformation provides a distinct disconnection strategy to access these heterocycles in comparison to traditional approaches. The scope, tolerance, and utility of the method are discussed, and mechanistic studies are examined to better understand reactivity and selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of 1-pyrrolines from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8242;]-sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely substituted 1-pyrrolines with high regio- and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo- and regioisomeric preferences of the 1-pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1-pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Low&#8208;Flammable Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12999-13006, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes are developed for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With fluoroethylene carbonate as a proper electrolyte additive, the trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte achieves greatly extended cycle life over the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte, due to the formation of enhanced surface protection layers, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.







Abstract
Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMPa) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMPa and tuning the composition of the solvation sheaths via electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMPa&#8208;based electrolytes in Gr&#8741;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.4&#8197;V, the batteries containing the TMPa&#8208;based LHCE with a proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4&#8201;%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2&#8201;%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMPa, TMPa&#8208;based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.

         <title>The Electrolysis of Anti&#8208;Perovskite Li2OHCl for Prelithiation of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13013-13020, June 1, 2021. </description>

Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was demonstrated could be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V via two oxidizing routes, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ that obtain electrons to deposit or intercalate in anode, with which as cathode Li&#8208;reservoir for pre&#8208;lithiation, the capacities of NMC811&#8741;Si@C full cells were increased proportionally with the varying dosage of pre&#8208;lithiation.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was previously studied as a solid&#8208;state Li+ conductor. Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3&#8197;V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of Li2OHCl starts at 4.0&#8197;V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3&#8197;V for the electrolysis of Li2OHCl. The electrolysis of Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 810&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Switching Regioselectivity via Simple Hydrazones</title>

A highly effective Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative alkylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane with branched selectivity was achieved by using a cooperative strategy that integrated the unique trifunctional character of hydrazones with Pd/NHC catalysis.







Abstract
Conventional approaches for Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;couplings of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with nucleophiles predominantly deliver the &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkene scaffolds (linear selectivity). Herein, we report a cooperative strategy that can completely switch the reaction selectivity to give the alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkene skeletons (branched selectivity). The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enables analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including modified pharmaceutical and biological molecules, can be efficiently functionalized with high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluorinated alkene motifs under mild conditions.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;Induced Symmetry Breaking: A Versatile Approach to the Scalable Production of Colloidal Particles with a Janus Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12980-12984, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking of spherical symmetry is achieved when a polystyrene (PS) bead encapsulated in a shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS. The swelling&#8208;increased pressure will poke a hole in the shell and then extrude the swollen PS out, leading to the generation of a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components.







Abstract
Janus particles are widely sought for applications related to colloidal assembly, stabilization of emulsions, and development of active colloids, among others. Here we report a versatile route to the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled Janus particles by simply breaking the symmetry of spherical particles with swelling. When a polystyrene (PS) sphere covered by a rigid shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS, a gradually increased pressure will be created inside the shell. If the pressure becomes high enough to poke a hole in the shell, the spherical symmetry will break while pushing out the swollen PS through the opening to generate a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components. One of the components is made of PS and its size is controlled by the extent of swelling. The other component is comprised of the rigid shell and remaining PS, with its overall diameter determined by the original PS sphere and the rigid shell. This solution&#8208;based route holds promises for the scalable production of complex Janus particles with a variety of compositions and in large quantities.

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12964-12970, June 1, 2021. </description>

Two new non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptors (NFRAs), denoted as PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from simple phenyl and thiophene units. The corresponding organic photovoltaics based on PTB4Cl:PBDB&#8208;TF have impressively achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest value among the fully non&#8208;fused NFRAs reported so far.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need work to approach the delicate balance between efficiency, stability, and cost. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of a two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays a synergistic role in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge&#8208;transfer rate in bulk heterojunction blends. As a result, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest values among the reported fully unfused electron acceptors so far.

Reported herein is the isolation, structure determination of (&#8722;)&#8208;isoscopariusin&#8197;A by spectroscopic analysis and concise chemical synthesis. The unprecedented meroditerpenoid bears a 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters, and exhibits selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from (+)&#8208;sclareolide.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A was isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2+2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively. (&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A displayed selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 23/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
A new methodology was developed for the preparation of superatomic nanoclusters in a controllable fashion, with an internal redox reaction of Ag7(H)L6 leading to the formation of a highly emissive two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10L8. Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu, and co&#8208;workers explain in their Communication on page&#8197;12712 that the metal framework of Ag7 is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting that Ag7(H)L6 acts as both reducing agent and template in the cluster build&#8208;up.

Control of the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction through tuning of molecular steric effects is demonstrated by Ran Long, Rui Cao, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;12742. Selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron oxygen reductions can be achieved by using Co porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. This work represents an unparalleled example of improving the oxygen reduction selectivity by tuning only steric effects of the catalysts without changing molecular and electronic structures.

In conjunction with appropriate nanomaterials, electromagnetic energy sources including alternating magnetic fields, ultrasound, near&#8208;infrared light, and X&#8208;rays can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cells, and thus potentiate cancer immunotherapy. This review discusses the recent development of electromagnetic nanomedicines in combination with various immunotherapies for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Immunotherapy that harnesses the power of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells has offered an effective approach for cancer treatment. However, limited patient response rates and potential immune&#8208;related adverse events exist as two major issues for cancer immunotherapy. In parallel, a variety of electromagnetic nanomaterials that generate heat and/or reactive oxygen species triggered by electromagnetic energy have been applied for magnetic hyperthermia therapy, sonodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy, which have the ability to induce immunogenic cell death. This review summarizes the recent development of electromagnetic nanomedicines in combinational cancer immunotherapy. The mechanisms of electromagnetic nanomedicines in reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and sensitizing tumors for cancer immunotherapy are highlighted. Furthermore, potential challenges and perspectives of electromagnetic nanomedicines for combinational cancer immunotherapy are discussed.

The recent discoveries of both dicationic and monoanionic ferrocene derivatives throw light on the effect of the substituents on the C5 ring as well as the choice of redox agents and solvent system in the preparation of previously believed to be difficult synthetic targets. These oxidized and reduced forms of ferrocene are of interest to spectroscopists, magnetochemists, and theoreticians.

         <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Mechanism since the 1930s: Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12660-12681, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of understanding of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction mechanism is described, from R.&#8197;B. Woodward's boyhood visions, to Ken Houk's experiences as a graduate student in Woodward's laboratory, to today's dynamical view of Diels&#8211;Alder and higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. Roald Hoffmann's Coda gives his view of Woodward and the zig&#8208;zag processes of scientific discovery.







Abstract
This review article describes the evolution of Woodward's mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8211;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. Houk&#8242;s research in the Woodward labs, testing the predictions of this theory, is described.

     alt="Evolution of the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Mechanism since the 1930s: Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of understanding of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction mechanism is described, from R.&#8197;B. Woodward's boyhood visions, to Ken Houk's experiences as a graduate student in Woodward's laboratory, to today's dynamical view of Diels&#8211;Alder and higher-order cycloadditions. Roald Hoffmann's Coda gives his view of Woodward and the zig-zag processes of scientific discovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review article describes the evolution of Woodward's mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge-transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8211;Katz two-stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. Houk&#8242;s research in the Woodward labs, testing the predictions of this theory, is described. Subsequent modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis-pericyclic transition states. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8211;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions provide a time-resolved picture of how these reactions occur. Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward's youth to today's trajectory simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12648-12658, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent bonds generated by chemical fuels are a fundamental tool for generating nonequilibrium reaction networks. In this Minireview, different approaches to transient bond formation are discussed, illustrating how similar fuel chemistry can be applied to a wide range of abiotic systems ranging from self&#8208;assembly to molecular machines.







Abstract
Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with by operating out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.

         <title>Iodine Redox Chemistry in Rechargeable Batteries</title>

The reversible redox reactions of iodine coupled with various anodes enable the fabrication of advanced rechargeable batteries. This Minireview summarizes the current understanding of the fundamental redox chemistry of iodine, with a special emphasis on the strategies for enhancing battery performance.







Abstract
Halogens have been coupled with metal anodes in a single cell to develop novel rechargeable batteries based on extrinsic redox reactions. Since the commercial introduction of lithium&#8208;iodine batteries in 1972, they have shown great potential to match the high&#8208;rate performance, large energy density, and good safety of advanced batteries. With the development of metal anodes (e.g. Li, Zn), one of the actual challenges lies in the preparation of electrochemically active and reliable iodine&#8208;based cathodes to prevent self&#8208;discharge and capacity decay of the rechargeable batteries. Understanding the fundamental reactions of iodine/polyiodide and their underlying mechanisms is still highly desirable to promote the rational design of advanced cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. In this Minireview, recent advances in the development of iodine&#8208;based cathodes to fabricate rechargeable batteries are summarized, with a special focus on the basic principles of iodine redox chemistry to correlate with structure&#8208;function relationships.

A multifaceted bond: High level Valence Bond calculations show that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is stabilized neither by a dative bond nor by a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond, but rather by a unique combination of three distinct components that are accurately quantified.







Abstract
Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8722;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;based Chiral Porous Polyimides for Enantioselective Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12781-12785, June 1, 2021. </description>

Chiral porous polyimides (FTPI) were synthesized using monomers of chiral 2,6&#8208;diaminotriptycene. The absolute configurations were identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The obtained R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.







Abstract
Enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (R, R&#8208;1 and S, S&#8208;1) are split by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Nanostructures with a Thermoresponsible Dynamic Polymer Shell</title>

Light&#8208;induced tuning of the optical response of silicon nanoparticles covered by polyelectrolyte shell occurs due to light&#8208;induced heating and concomitant swelling of the shell reversibly up to 120&#8197;C.







Abstract
We suggest a new strategy for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive bio&#8208;integrated optical nanostructures based on Mie&#8208;resonant silicon nanoparticles covered by an ensemble of similarity negatively charged polyelectrolytes (heparin and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). The dynamic tuning of the nanostructures&#8217; optical response is due to light&#8208;induced heating of the nanoparticles and swelling of the polyelectrolyte shell. The resulting hydrophilic/hydrophobic transitions significantly change the shell thickness and reversible shift of the scattering spectra for individual nanoparticles up to 60&#8197;nm. Our findings bring novel opportunities for the application of smart nanomaterials in nanomedicine and bio&#8208;integrated nanophotonics.

The dynamic tuning of the nanostructures&#8217; optical response is due to light-induced heating of the nanoparticles and swelling of the polyelectrolyte shell. The resulting hydrophilic/hydrophobic transitions significantly change the shell thickness and reversible shift of the scattering spectra for individual nanoparticles up to 60&#8197;nm. Our findings bring novel opportunities for the application of smart nanomaterials in nanomedicine and bio-integrated nanophotonics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Syntheses and Physical Properties of Cationic BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>

Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+) were synthesized via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Anion exchange gave a brickwork&#8208;type p&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion ([PCCp&#8211;]).







Abstract
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+s) were synthesized from a nitrogen&#8208;containing macrocycle via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Incorporating BN into PAH+ resulted in a remarkable hypsochromic shift due to an increase in the LUMO energy and the symmetry changes of the HOMO and LUMO. Electrophilic substitution or anion exchange of BN&#8208;PAH+ possessing tetrabromoborate as a counter anion (BN+[BBr4&#8722;]) afforded air&#8208;stable BN&#8208;PAH/PAH+s. Of these, BN+[TfO&#8722;] allowed reversible two&#8208;electron reduction and the formation of two&#8208;dimensional brickwork&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion, demonstrating the potential application of BN&#8208;PAH+ as electronic materials.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12712-12716, June 1, 2021. </description>

A self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8, without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth.







Abstract
Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron number not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate&#8208;stabilized two&#8208;electron silver nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8 (1), is isolated via a self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. 1 is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD&#8208;DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1Px&#8594;1S nature.

         <title>An Aromatic Micelle&#8208;Based Saccharide Cluster with Changeable Fluorescent Color and its Protein Interactions</title>

A multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle forms in water through quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from blue to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.







Abstract
To develop a new type of synthetic saccharide clusters with changeable fluorescent colors, we herein designed a multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle. The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ca. 18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02&#8197;mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (&#934;F=19&#8201;%) to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters, both with and without the dyes, display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation**

         <dc:description>
Mechanical and thermal activation enable the solvent&#8208;free oligomerization of inactivated amino acids in the presence of TiO2 to form peptides. Our observations validate the usefulness of mechanochemistry to simulate and study prebiotic chemistry in an impact scenario where dry land and mineral surfaces are critical for the concentration and formation of organic building blocks.







Abstract
The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. Prebiotically plausible pathways to peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear as most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Now, a combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12841-12846, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonded ternary cocrystals were synthesized by employing three different approaches. The possible reasons for the formation of these cocrystals have been proposed based on a detailed crystal packing analysis and computational results.







Abstract
Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to be of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12786-12790, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh nanoparticle catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon were developed for asymmetric insertions of carbenoids derived from diazoesters into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. The nitrogen dopants are essential to promote the reactions. The catalyst could be reused several times and was applicable for a continuous&#8208;flow reaction system that produced the desired chiral amine for over 90&#8197;h through reactivation of the catalyst.







Abstract
Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90&#8197;h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12754-12758, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic oligomer micelle was formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers. The well&#8208;defined nanostructure remains intact even under dilution and at high temperature. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes; the resultant host&#8211;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers.







Abstract
An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both high stability and high uptake ability, was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers, composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ca. 2&#8197;nm, remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (ca. 3&#8197;&#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (&#916;H=&#8722;110&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.

We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis to convert enynamides and vinyl ethylene carbonates to furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles via azadiene generation followed by [5+4] cycloaddition. Conformation&#8208;controlled diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings and oxidative furan cleavage enabled access to diverse polyfunctionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis system to access furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency and enantioselectivity. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, easily accessible enynamides undergo cyclization to generate azadienes in situ that participate in enantioselective formal [5+4] cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonates. Conformation&#8208;controlled highly diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings, coupled with oxidative furan cleavage, have enabled the access to diverse densely&#8208;functionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.

Protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates&#8212;for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells.







Abstract
We report here on protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. We utilize spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.

A two&#8208;centre one&#8208;electron bond (2c&#8211;1e): Chemical bonding analysis using electron localization function (ELF), at correlated level, shows that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B 2c&#8211;1e bond.







Abstract
It is here reported that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B one&#8208;electron bond, a well&#8208;established type of electron&#8208;deficient bonding in the literature. The topological analysis of the electron localization function, at the correlated level, reveals that Na&#8722;, when approaching the bonding distance, fairly distributes its valence electron pair between two lobes. One of these electrons is used to bond with BH3, which participates through its boron empty p&#8208;orbital. Furthermore, the bonding situation of LiBH3&#8722;, KBH3&#8722;, MgBH3, and CaBH3 global minima structures are similar to that of NaBH3&#8722;, extending the family of these new one&#8208;electron bond systems with biradicaloid character.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12824-12828, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis is developed. Simple aryl iodides are used as the resolution reagent. Both enantioenriched tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic applications are demonstrated by the facile synthesis of diversified biorelevant heterocycles.







Abstract
Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Arborisidine</title>

A serendipitous regiodivergent parallel kinetic resolution via dearomative asymmetric allylic alkylation, together with a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization, realized a novel approach to (&#8722;)&#8208;arborisidine. 







Abstract
An asymmetric total synthesis of cage&#8208;like indole alkaloid arborisidine is presented. The new synthetic strategy features a catalytic parallel kinetic resolution based on ambident nucleophilicity (C3/N) of indole to set the absolute configurations of the two quaternary chiral centers, and a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to form the bridged nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered ring.

A novel onion&#8208;like carbon&#8208;nanosphere&#8208;coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material was reported for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits excellent ORR/OER activity and Zn&#8208;air battery performance than Co&#8208;N&#8208;C without OLC structure. Highly curved OLC is beneficial for adsorption of intermediates during ORR/OER process comparing with their analogues in un&#8208;curved graphene.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene could catalyze the electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen, but unfortunately suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, for the first time, we report an onion&#8208;like carbon coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material, which possesses multilayers of highly curved nanostructures that form mesoporous architectures. These unique nanospheres are produced when surfactant micelles are introduced to synthesis precursors. Owing to the combined electronic effect and nanostructuring effect, our OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C materials exhibit high bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity, showing a promising application in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Experimental results are rationalized by theoretical calculations, showing that the curvature of graphitic carbon plays a vital role in promoting activities of meta&#8208;carbon atoms near graphitic N and ortho/meta carbon atoms close to pyridinic N.

         <title>Structural Analysis of an Antigen Chemically Coupled on Virus&#8208;Like Particles in Vaccine Formulation</title>

The sensitivity boost provided by dynamic nuclear polarization and proton detection with fast magic&#8208;angle spinning renders solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy capable of structural analysis in heterogeneous vaccine formulations with dilute adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens. This methodology is demonstrated on the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen after coupling to virus&#8208;like particles.







Abstract
Structure determination of adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens is essential for rational vaccine development but has so far been hampered by the relatively low antigen content in vaccine formulations and by their heterogeneous composition. Here we show that magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR can be used to assess the structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen, both in its free, unformulated form and once chemically coupled to the surface of large virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs). The sensitivity boost provided by high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and proton detection at fast MAS rates allows to overcome the penalty associated with the antigen dilution. Comparison of the MAS NMR fingerprints between the free and VLP&#8208;coupled forms of the antigen provides structural evidence of the conservation of its native fold upon bioconjugation. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;sensitivity MAS NMR is ripe to play a major role in vaccine design, formulation studies, and manufacturing process development.

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12819-12823, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystal nucleus and the growth of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.







Abstract
The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.

         <title>Ferroelectric and Spin Crossover Behavior in a Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12717-12722, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular ferroelectrics induced by molecular rotors, multifunctional compound exhibiting both ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior was constructed. The flip&#8211;flop motion of polarization unit results in the expression of ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior.







Abstract
Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)2](BPh4)2&#8901;3ac (1&#8901;3&#8201;ac; FPh&#8208;terpy=4&#8242;&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8211;flop motion of the ligand's polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8211;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8211;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Norzoanthamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12807-12812, June 1, 2021. </description>

We report herein an asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine, a complex marine zoanthamine alkaloid, via radical and bio&#8208;inspired cyclizations comprising the following key steps: 1)&#8197;the Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization; 2)&#8197;a unique Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; 3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; and 4)&#8197;a one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired bis&#8208;aminoacetalization.







Abstract
We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which is the major synthetic challenge for most zoanthamine alkaloids. (1)&#8197;The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at the C&#8208;9 and C&#8208;22 positions; (2)&#8197;a Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C&#8208;12 via Csp3&#8208;Csp2 bond formation; (3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra&#8208;substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis&#8208;amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12742-12746, June 1, 2021. </description>

Cobalt porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects were synthesized. One isomer is selective for the 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, one is selective for the 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, while the other two show poor selectivity for either 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Achieving a selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical but challenging. Herein, we report controlling ORR selectivity of Co porphyrins by tuning only steric effects. We designed Co porphyrin 1 with meso&#8208;phenyls each bearing a bulky ortho&#8208;amido group. Due to the resulted steric hinderance, 1 has four atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. Isomers &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; catalyze ORR with n=2.10 and 3.75 (n is the electron number transferred per O2), respectively, but &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946; show poor selectivity with n=2.89&#8211;3.10. Isomer &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; catalyzes 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by preventing a bimolecular O2 activation path, while &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; improves 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR selectivity by improving O2 binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including O K&#8208;edge near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2&#8201;e&#8722; and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12796-12801, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self&#8208;assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.







Abstract
Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.

&lt;p&gt;The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self-assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self-assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S-phosphate to the C-terminal of a self-assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP-catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self-assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.&lt;/p&gt;

Facile and modular access to stereodefined disubstituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers allowed their successful application in a stereoselective aldol reaction affording the products with excellent yields and diastereomeric ratios.

         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>

The first terminal imido complex of an iron&#8211;sulfur cluster has been synthesized and fully characterized. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis suggest an [Fe4S4]2+=[NAr]2&#8722; formulation with a localized high&#8208;spin Fe3+ valence at the imido&#8208;bound site, and reactivity studies demonstrate competence for C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3 to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center, which is manifested in its long Fe&#8722;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#8197;&#197;. Cluster 2 abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8722;H activation.

2D MOFs on nickel foam (NF) were assembled. NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior OER performance (overpotential of 195&#8197;mV at 10 and 241&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions. The ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV (lower than NiFe double hydroxides: 0.81&#8197;eV).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195&#8197;mV and 241&#8197;mV at 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV, which is lower than that (0.81&#8197;eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.

Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize one&#8208;dimensionally stacked structures. We found that nanographenes carrying long alkyl chains behaved similarly. The experiments demonstrated that the nanographenes underwent aggregation and disaggregation regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication.







Abstract
Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize stacked structures that display interesting properties arising from their unique morphologies. Although nanographenes produced by top&#8208;down methods have graphitic domains and can in principle be applied for such supramolecular systems, to our knowledge, no such example has been reported thus far. This is partly because of their limited solubility in organic solvents and partly because of their wide lateral size distribution. To realize nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular aggregates, nanographenes carrying alkyl chains with narrow lateral size distributions are employed. We find that the nanographenes undergo self&#8208;assembly and that self&#8208;assembly is regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication. Optical measurements and AFM images indicate that stacked structures are possible candidates for aggregates. A molecular mechanics calculation models the interactions in the aggregates. The nanographenes showed concentration&#8208;dependent morphologies on mica, stacked structures at low concentrations and polymer&#8208;like network structures on mica at higher concentrations.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12829-12834, June 1, 2021. </description>

Corroles substituted with only two or three carboxylic acid groups were obtained from readily available starting materials through a novel pathway (see scheme). These macrocycles and the corresponding metal chelates fulfill all the criteria of druglikeness and have potential for both bioimaging and therapy.







Abstract
Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases.

     alt="Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corroles substituted with only two or three carboxylic acid groups were obtained from readily available starting materials through a novel pathway (see scheme). These macrocycles and the corresponding metal chelates fulfill all the criteria of druglikeness and have potential for both bioimaging and therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heme-like metal-chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogues) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very straightforward synthetic method that relies on surprisingly facile trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association with plasma proteins and their performance for catalase-like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Insertion of Furyl Carbene into the N&#8208;H Bond of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric carbene insertion reactions represent one of the most important protocols to construct carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The use of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds bearing an ester group is however a prerequisite for achieving high enantioselectivity. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8208;H insertion of 2&#8208;pyridones that has been accomplished for the first time with enynones as the donor&#8208;donor carbene precursors. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective 1,4&#8208;proton transfer from O to C. The rhodium catalyst provides a chiral pocket in which the steric repulsion and the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the propeller ligand play a critical role in determining the selectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a mild and efficient method for synthesizing enantioenriched tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused cyclobutenes through a cascade reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines and alkynones with catalysis by chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes. The bisboranes served two functions: first they catalyzed a hydride transfer to convert the 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline substrate to a 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline, and then they activated the alkynone substrate for an enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline generated in situ.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical superstructures by combining crystallization&#8208;driven and molecular self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining the unique corona structure of worm&#8208;like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fibre with the molecular self&#8208;assembly of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir tree&#8208;like morphology. For this purpose, worm&#8208;like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fibre by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibres were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino&#8208;functionalized BTA to induce patch&#8208;mediated molecular self&#8208;assembly to well&#8208;defined fir&#8208;tree like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibres&#8217; surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Iodine(III) Reagents for the Lipophilization of Peptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the functionalization of cysteine residues with lipophilic alkynes bearing silyl groups and alkyl chains using amphiphilic ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents (EBXs). The reactions were carried out in buffer (pH 6 to 9), without organic co&#8208;solvent or removal of oxygen, either at 37 &#176;C or room temperature. The transformation led to a significant increase of peptide lipophilicity and worked for aromatic thiols, homocysteine, cysteine and peptides containing 4 to 18 amino acids. His  6  &#8208;Cys&#8208;Ubiquitin was also alkynylated under physiological conditions. Under acidic conditions, the thioalkynes were converted into thioesters, which could be cleaved in the presence of hydroxylamine.</dc:description>

         <title>Creation of High&#8208;Performance Heterogeneous Photocatalysts by Controlling Ligand Desorption and Particle Size of Gold Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the creation of new heterogeneous catalysts using the unique electronic/geometrical structures of small metal nanoclusters (NCs) has received considerable attention. However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand&#8208;protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrated that the ligand&#8208;desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support, and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated. Based on the obtained knowledge, we established a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic cages are fascinating synthetic goals because of their well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional cavities, excellent stability and accessible post&#8208;modification. However, the synthesis is normally realized by fragment coupling approach in low yields. Herein, we report one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages (box&#8208;shaped [4]cage and triangular prism&#8208;shaped [2]cage) in yields of 46% and 52%, involving direct condensation of triangular 1,3,5&#8208;tris(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)benzene monomer with paraformaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde, respectively. The resulted cage can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogue which exhibits great potential for further modification. Moreover, [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane. By changing the central moiety of the triangular monomer and/or aldehyde, this synthetic method would have the potential to be a general strategy to access diverse cages with tunable shape, size, and electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries: Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their fast development as promising energy storage devices. We hereby utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4  electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation in scales ranging from atom&#8208;level (sub&#8208;nanometer) quantum chemistry calculation, molecule&#8208;level (nanometer) ab&#8208;initio calculation and molecular dynamics simulations to macro&#8208;level (micrometer) finite element analysis, we prove that the glucose in ZnSO4  aqueous environment can simultanously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+  and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering is capable of alternating one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2  full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4  electrolyte. These results pave a way to excavate cheap and high&#8208;efficient electrolyte engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Induced Heterogenization of Nickel and Palladium Catalysts for Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefins via the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers presents a great challenge. Despite the extensive academic research on homogeneous catalysts, the use of heterogeneous catalysts for this purpose remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous naphthoquinone&#8208;based nickel (Ni/SiO  2  ) and palladium (Pd/SiO  2  ) catalysts through hydrogen bonding interactions of the ligands with the silica surface. Ni/SiO  2  exhibits high activities (up to 2.65 &#215; 10  6  g&#183;mol  &#8722;1  &#183;h  &#8722;1  ) during the copolymerization of ethylene with 5&#8208;hexene&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;acetate,  affording high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (M  n  up to 630,000) polar&#8208;functionalized semicrystalline polyethylene (comonomer incorporation up to 2.8 mol%)  , along with great morphology control. The resulting copolymers possess improved surface properties and great mechanical properties. Pd/SiO  2  can mediate ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers such as methyl acrylate and norbornene derivatives with moderate activity (10  4  &#8211; 10  5  g&#183;mol  &#8722;1  &#183;h  &#8722;1  )  to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight copolymers (M  n  up to 98,000) with tunable comonomer incorporation (0.5&#8208;0.7% for methyl acrylate and 63.1&#8208;72.3% for 5&#8208;norbornen&#8208;2&#8208;yl acetate).</dc:description>

An enantioenriched lactam building block, synthesized through Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation, serves as the precursor to both hemispheres. The eburnamonine&#8208;derived fragment is synthesized through a Bischler&#8211;Napieralski/hydrogenation approach while the eucophylline&#8208;derived fragment is synthesized by a Friedl&#228;nder quinoline synthesis and two sequential C&#8208;H functionalization steps.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Ketimines and Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction represents one of the most efficient method for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines. Nevertheless, the catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3  H  &#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C  6  F  5  )  3  /chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). Notely, the reaction is very efficient, in which the catalyst loadings for the model reaction can be reduced to 0.1 mol% and the enantioselectivity is still maintained. Besides, the synthetic utility of the protocol was proved by transformations of the products. Moreover, DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric  Alkenyl  Catellani Reaction for the Construction of C&#8211;N Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an asymmetric two&#8208;component vinylogous Catellani reaction for the construction of C&#8211;N axial chirality through a palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis and an axial&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer process. Various partially aromatic iodinated 2&#8208;pyridones, quinolones, coumarin and uracil substrates  react with 2,6&#8208;disubstituted aryl bromides with a tethered amide group, to  afford a wide variety of polycyclic C&#8211;N atropisomers (39 examples, up to 97%  ee  ).  The obtained C&#8211;N axial chirality is originated from the preformed transient C&#8211;C axial chirality with high fidelity. The synthetic utility of this chemistry is demonstrated by facile preparation of  complex quinoline and pyridine based C&#8211;N atropisomers through a  N  &#8208;deprotection and aromatization sequence. In addition, a remote axial&#8208;to&#8208;central diastereoinduction process dictated by C&#8211;N axial chirality is observed with excellent diastereocontrol. This research opens a new avenue for asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising approach to reduce atmospheric CO  2  concentration and realize carbon&#8208;energy balance. However, the low current density still limits CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) for commercial application. Crystalline porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising alternatives for CO  2  RR due to their high CO  2  adsorption uptakes and periodically arranged isolated metal active sites. However, the poor conductivity and slow electron&#8208;transfer capability of the traditional MOFs usually result in low current density in CO  2  RR. Herein, conductive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based MOF (NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  ) nanosheets were prepared by the construction of nickel phthalocyanin&#8208;2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octaol (NiPc&#8208;OH) and nickel(II) ions,   which can be   employed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR towards production of CO. The obtained NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  has a good conductivity with a high value of   4.8   &#180;   10  &#8208;    5    S m  &#8208;1  due to the in&#8208;plane full &#960;&#8208;d conjugation. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  nanosheets exhibited a very high selectivity of 98.4% towards production of CO and a large CO partial current density of 34.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , outperform   ing   the reported MOF catalysts. This work offers an opportunity to design conductive crystalline frameworks for improving energy efficiency in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into value-added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising approach to reduce atmospheric CO  2  concentration and realize carbon-energy balance. However, the low current density still limits CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) for commercial application. Crystalline porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising alternatives for CO  2  RR due to their high CO  2  adsorption uptakes and periodically arranged isolated metal active sites. However, the poor conductivity and slow electron-transfer capability of the traditional MOFs usually result in low current density in CO  2  RR. Herein, conductive two-dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine-based MOF (NiPc-NiO  4  ) nanosheets were prepared by the construction of nickel phthalocyanin-2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaol (NiPc-OH) and nickel(II) ions,   which can be   employed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR towards production of CO. The obtained NiPc-NiO  4  has a good conductivity with a high value of   4.8   &#180;   10  -    5    S m  -1  due to the in-plane full &#960;-d conjugation. Thus, the as-prepared NiPc-NiO  4  nanosheets exhibited a very high selectivity of 98.4% towards production of CO and a large CO partial current density of 34.5 mA cm  -2  , outperform   ing   the reported MOF catalysts. This work offers an opportunity to design conductive crystalline frameworks for improving energy efficiency in electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D  c  &#8208;MOFs) are emerging as new&#8208;generation electroactive materials for chemiresistive sensors. However, selective sensing with fast response/recovery remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni  2  [MPc(NH)  8  ] 2D  c  &#8208;MOF films as active layers for polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitors toward water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We demonstrate that surface&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;modification&#160;by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains on 2D  c  &#8208;MOF films reduces the amount of diffused analytes into the MOF backbone, thus resulting in a considerably accelerated recovery progress (from ~ 50 to ~ 10 s) during humidity sensing. Toward VOCs, the sensors deliver a polarity&#8208;selective response among alcohols while no signal is recorded for the low&#8208;polar aprotic hydrocarbons. Typically, the octadecyltrimethoxysilane&#8208;modified&#160;Ni  2  [MPc(NH)  8  ] based sensor displays high&#8208;performance methanol sensing with fast response (36 s)/recovery (13 s) and a detection limit as low as 10 ppm, which surpass the reported chemiresistors based on MOFs, conducting polymers, metal disulfides, and black phosphorus at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Polymersomes with Structure Inherent Fluorescence and Targeting Capacity for Enhanced Photo&#8208;Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biodegradable nanostructures displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) are desirable from a biomedical point of view, due to the advantageous features of loading capacity, emission brightness, and fluorescence stability. Herein, biodegradable polymers comprising poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;P(CLgTMC)), with tetraphenylethylene pyridinium&#8208;TMC (PAIE) side chains have been developed, which self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined polymersomes. The resultant AIEgenic polymersomes are intrinsically fluorescent delivery vehicles. The presence of the pyridinium moiety endows the polymersomes with mitochondrial targeting ability, which improves the efficiency of co&#8208;encapsulated photosensitizers and improves therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This contribution showcases the ability to engineer AIEgenic polymersomes with structure inherent fluorescence and targeting capacity for enhanced photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since anions are vital for many chemical, biological and environmental processes, their recognition and separation continue to attract attention from chemists, materials scientists and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to recognize selectively anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between hexachloroplatinate dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, a phenomenon&#160;which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through the noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective hexachloroplatinate&#160;dianion recognition is driven by the weak [Pt&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O] ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. It is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We have also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively hexachloroplatinate dianions from mixtures of hexachloroplatinate, tetrachloropalladate, and hexachlororhodate anions. This highly selective and fast co&#8208;crystallization process, in principle, could be exploited to recover platinum from the spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atom(s) and/or fluoroalkyl group(s) insertion can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can sometimes be meaningless in most cases. Taking the opportunity of a wide range of data coming from the quest of carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this review attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; how wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety, in order to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand protein interactions, depending on the location the fluorine substitution is targeted on the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, Kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR are useful in dissecting single binding contribution to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of the selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralight Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li&#8208;S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83 g mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8208;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8208;S batteries using conventional counterparts (~1.2 g mL&#8722;1), the Li&#8208;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2 g Ah&#8722;1 and realize a 19.2% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4 Wh kg&#8722;1) under E/S =3.0 &#956;L mg&#8722;1. Moreover, more than 20% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li-S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83 g mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly-coordinating and Li-compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li-S pouch cell functionality under lean-electrolyte conditions.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite high specific capacity (3860 mAh g  &#8722;1  ), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1 mAh cm  &#8722;2  . Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li  +  &#8208;PF  6  &#8208;  ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5 Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357 Wh kg  &#8722;1  ) with 90.90% capacity retention over 50 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Allene&#8208;Containing Molecules via Enantioselective Reactions of Azolium Cumulenolate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition involving cumulenolates is disclosed. Both allene and spirooxindole products could be accessed with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities by varying the amount of the base.







Abstract
Azolium cumulenolates are a special type of intermediates in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. They contain elongated linear structures with three contiguous C=C bonds and sterically unhindered &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. These structural features make it difficult to develop enantioselective reactions for these intermediates. Here we disclose the first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition reactions of azolium cumulenolates. The reaction starts with alkynals as the precursors for azolium cumulenolate intermediates that undergo enantioselective addition to activated ketones. From the same set of substrates, both allene and spirooxindole products can be obtained with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The allene moieties in our optically enriched products carry rich reactivities and can be transformed to diverse molecules. The spirooxindole scaffolds in our products are important structural motifs in natural products and medicines.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Adenine&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient Live&#8208;Cell MicroRNA Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PolyA&#8208;SNAs (poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids) exhibit high cell entry efficiency and programmable lateral spacing of anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) units, enabling efficient miRNA capture in living cells and mice. The in vivo inhibition of oncogenic miRNA results in potent suppression of tumor growth.







Abstract
Direct delivery of exogenous non&#8208;coding nucleic acids into living cells has attracted intense interest in biological applications. However, the cell entry efficiency and target capture ability remain to be improved. Herein, we report a method for compartmenting the nucleic acids on the surface of poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (polyA&#8208;SNAs) for efficient capture of oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. We find that polyA&#8208;SNAs exhibit high cell entry efficiency, which is insensitive to the configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences. By programming the length of polyAs, we precisely engineered the spatial configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences in polyA&#8208;SNAs. Compartmentalized polyA&#8208;SNAs bind to miRNAs with improved capture ability as compared to densely compacted SNAs. We further demonstrate that polyA&#8208;SNAs serve as high&#8208;efficacy miRNA sponges for capturing oncogenic miRNAs both in living cells and in mice. The efficient inhibition of miRNAs results in significant suppression of tumor growth.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Improved Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase for Incorporation of L&#8208;3,4&#8208;Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechols are capable of diverse interactions with metals, radical chemistry, the ability to form redox&#8208;mediated crosslinks, and play an important role in many biological polymers. Genetic tools are presented that enable site&#8208;specific incorporation of the catechol amino acid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) into proteins in bacteria, and a new DOPA&#8208;specific fluorescent biosensor for monitoring incorporation in living cells.







Abstract
The catechol group of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) derived from L&#8208;tyrosine oxidation is a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) in many protein biomaterials and has potential as a bioorthogonal handle for precision protein conjugation applications such as antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. Despite this potential, indiscriminate enzymatic modification of exposed tyrosine residues or complete replacement of tyrosine using auxotrophic hosts remains the preferred method of introducing the catechol moiety into proteins, which precludes many protein engineering applications. We have developed new orthogonal translation machinery to site&#8208;specifically incorporate L&#8208;DOPA into recombinant proteins and a new fluorescent biosensor to selectively monitor L&#8208;DOPA incorporation in vivo. We show simultaneous biosynthesis and incorporation of L&#8208;DOPA and apply this translation machinery to engineer a novel metalloprotein containing a DOPA&#8208;Fe chromophore.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone&#8197;A and Preaustinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, we accomplished the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A and its five preaustinoid congeners. Meanwhile, we also uncovered a series of biomimetic rearrangements that would lend credence to the proposed biosynthetic sequence of DMOA&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid&#8208;derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)&#8208;preaustinoids&#8197;A, A1, B, B1, and B2) in 12&#8211;15 steps, starting from commercially available 2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate. Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry&#8208;breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;&#8208;ketol, &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.

We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;-ketol, &#945;-hydroxyl-&#946;-diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)-berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Dielectric Property and Energy Transfer on Charge Separation in Non&#8208;Fullerene&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of the higher dielectric property of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and corresponding photoactive films and the energy transfer from donor to acceptor on charge separation of selected non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, these results well interpret the high device performance with a tiny driving force, and the intrinsic physical working mechanism on non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is proposed.







Abstract
In non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, it is unclear how excitons efficiently dissociate into charge carriers under small driving force. Here, we developed a modified method to estimate dielectric constants of PM6 donor and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Surprisingly, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and blend films showed higher dielectric constants. Moreover, they exhibited larger dielectric constants differences at the optical frequency. These results are likely bound to reduced exciton binding energy and bimolecular recombination. Besides, the overlap between the emission spectrum of donor and absorption spectra of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors allowed the energy transfer from donor to acceptors. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of dielectric property and energy transfer resulting in efficient charge separation, our finding paves an alternative path to elucidate the physical working mechanism in non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Confined Spaces in [n]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes was synthesized. K&#8208;region functionalization of the pyrene moieties led to a confined space within those macrocycles. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5 and resulted in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host binding with shape complementary alkaline crown ethers. A multifaceted approach combining computation, spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis elucidated the binding.







Abstract
A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1 between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape&#8208;complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.

         <title>Synthesis, Electronic Structure, and Reactivity of a Planar Four&#8208;Coordinate, Cobalt&#8211;Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;coordinate, planar cobalt&#8211;imido compound was isolated and characterized. Integrated experimental and computational studies identified radical character on the iminyl nitrogen accounting for a reduction in overall bond order. Upon thermolysis, the complex underwent selective P&#8211;N coupling with the desymmetrized pincer. Transition state analysis revealed that thermodynamic control is the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
A four&#8208;coordinate cobalt&#8211;imido complex, (tBumPNP)Co=NMes (tBumPNP=modified PNP pincer ligand) has been synthesized from addition of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylazide (Mes&#8211;N3) to the corresponding dinitrogen complex. The solid&#8208;state structure determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction established a rare, idealized planar geometry with a Co=N bond distance of 1.716(2)&#8197;&#197;. Magnetic measurements revealed an S=1 ground state with CAS&#8208;SCF calculations supporting radical character on the imide nitrogen. Thermolysis of the cobalt&#8211;imido compound induced selective insertion of the imido group into a Co&#8722;P bond and yielded a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt complex with a distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. Transition state analysis conducted with DFT calculations established the thermodynamic stability of the P&#8211;N coupled product and provided insight into the exclusive selectivity.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Generation in Dark&#8208;Hypoxia by Catalytic Microenvironment&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactors for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactors (CMTNs) with a built&#8208;in ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent 1O2 sensor were fabricated for monitored chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Benefiting from the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and glutathione (GSH), the liposome&#8208;based CMTNs afford favorable pH for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protect MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation&#8208;triggered inactivation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) has a potent anticancer effect, but photosensitized generation of 1O2 is inhibited by tumor hypoxia and limited light penetration depth. Despite the potential of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to circumvent these issues by exploration of 1O2&#8208;producing catalysts, engineering efficient CDT agents is still a formidable challenge since most catalysts require specific pH to function and become inactivated upon chelation by glutathione (GSH). Herein, we present a catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactor (CMTN), constructed by encapsulating MoO42&#8722; catalyst and alkaline sodium carbonate within liposomes, which offers a favorable pH condition for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protects MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation owing to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. H2O2 and 1O2 can freely cross the liposomal membrane, allowing CMTN with a built&#8208;in NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescent 1O2 sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.

Magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation in two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) is demonstrated with a polar soft ferromagnetic system for the first time. The polarity of 2D&#8208;OIHPs is found in the nonmagnetic organic layers and also in the magnetic inorganic layers, where the ME response should be induced. Reflecting the soft magnetic nature, the ME&#8208;response is achieved by a low magnetic field.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) are attracting interest due to their structural tunability and rich functional characteristics, such as ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Here, we report the chiral&#8208;polar ferromagnetic 2D&#8208;OIHP copper chlorides with discernable electric polarization in the inorganic layers. In these systems, the magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation has been clearly observed by measuring a magneto&#8208;electric directional anisotropy (MEA), in which an optical absorption coefficient changes with reversal of the light propagating direction. We have found that the MEA can be induced by a low magnetic field of about 50&#8197;mT, reflecting soft magnetic nature. The present results suggest a new paradigm for designing functional ME multiferroics, which effectively couples magnetic and electric properties.

         <title>Optimizing Charge Transfer and Out&#8208;Coupling of A Quasi&#8208;Planar Deep&#8208;Red TADF Emitter: towards Rec.2020 Gamut and External Quantum Efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%</title>

A deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA for UHD display was demonstrated, which realized the desired chromaticity matching rec.2020 standard and the record external quantum efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%. It is showed that its quasi&#8208;planar structure not only improves horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation for out&#8208;coupling enhancement, but also balances the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer for radiation facilitation and quenching suppression.







Abstract
Herein, we report a deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA, composed of quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (pCNQ) acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) donor. pCNQ&#8211;TPA supported its OLED with desired CIE coordinates of (0.69, 0.31) and the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.3&#8201;%, which is the best red TADF diode with Rec.2020 gamut for UHDTV. It is showed that through tuning pCNQ&#8211;TPA doping concentration, intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer are balanced to synchronously improve emission color saturation and TADF radiation, and remedy aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, rendering photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching 90&#8201;% for deep&#8208;red emission peaked at &#8776;690&#8197;nm. Quasi&#8208;planar structure further endows pCNQ&#8211;TPA with an improved horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation, which increases light out&#8208;coupling ratio to 0.34 for achieving the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiencies.

         <title>Titanocene&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2] Cycloaddition of Bisenones and Comparison with Photoredox Catalysis and Established Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For [2+2] cycloaddition reactions of bisenones, higher yields and diastereoselectivities as well as greater substrate scope were observed under catalysis by Cp2Ti(TFA) than with previously established methods (see scheme). The mechanism is characterized by a highly unusual combination of an unfavorable and rate&#8208;determining 5&#8208;exo and favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization, as established by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Cp2Ti(TFA) is a broadly applicable catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenones by inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer. The attractiveness of this mechanism is shown by comparison with outer&#8208;sphere ET methods. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a unique unfavorable 5&#8208;exo (the rate&#8208;determining step) and a favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization.

         <title>A Supramolecular Complex of C60&#8211;S with High&#8208;Density Active Sites as a Cathode for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) was synthesized as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries by a simple one&#8208;step process. All C60 molecules in the complex provide active sites to adsorb LiPSs (see picture). Under practical conditions with a high S loading and a low electrolyte/S ratio, a Li&#8211;S battery delivered a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
The well&#8208;known &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and low sulfur utilization hinder the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, we describe a novel C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for LiPS adsorption that was formed by a simple one&#8208;step process as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries. Benefiting from the cocrystal structure, 100&#8201;% of the C60 molecules in the complex can offer active sites to adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their conversion. Furthermore, the lithiated C60 cores promote internal ion transport inside the composite cathode. At a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, the C60&#8211;S cathode with a sulfur loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibited a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The development of the C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex will inspire the invention of a new family of S/fullerenes as cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and extend the application of fullerenes.

         <title>In&#8197;Cellulo M&#246;ssbauer and EPR Studies Bring New Evidence to the Long&#8208;Standing Debate on Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Binding in Human Anamorsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined in&#8197;cellulo M&#246;ssbauer&#8208; and EPR&#8208;based approach is applied to address controversial aspects of Fe&#8211;S cluster&#8208;binding properties of human anamorsin, a protein involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster&#8208;binding proteins. We show that human anamorsin binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters in&#8208;cell in two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs typical of the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family, with different electron&#8208;spin&#8208;relaxation properties.







Abstract
Human anamorsin is an iron&#8211;sulfur&#8201;(Fe&#8211;S)&#8208;cluster&#8208;binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8211;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs, each binding an Fe&#8211;S cluster. In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine&#8208;rich motifs.

In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur-cluster-bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine-rich motifs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The&#160;Role of Non&#8209;Covalent Interactions on Cluster Formation: Pentamer, Hexamers and Heptamer of Difluoromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) has broadened with the inclusion of new types of interactions and&#160;a&#160;plethoraof weak donor/acceptor partners. This work illustrates the potential of chirped&#8209;pulse Fourier transform microwave technique, which has revolutionized the field of rotational spectroscopy. In particular, it has been exploited to reveal the role of NCIs&#8217; in the molecular self&#8209;aggregation of difluoromethane&#160;where&#160;a pentamer, two hexamers and a heptamer were detected.&#160;The development of a new automated assignment program and a sophisticated computational screening protocol was essential for identifying the homoclusters in conditions of spectral congestion.&#160;The major role of dispersion forces leads to less directional interactions and more distorted structures than those found in polar clusters although, a detailed analysis demonstrates that the dominant interaction energy is the pairwise interaction. The tetramer&#160;cluster is identified as a structural unit in larger clusters, representing the maximum expression of bond between dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of First Magnesium Fluorooxoborate with Stable Fluorine Terminated Framework for Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO application. More importantly, we demonstrated that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.







Abstract
The generated light can be tuned to cover almost the entire spectral range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths by utilizing the nonlinear optical crystals with a simple frequency doubling process. Among them, the discovery of novel candidates for the production of deep&#8208;ultraviolet light is by extension a great challenge toward realizing the vast potential. Actually, the availability for this process mainly depends on whether the critical performance can be well coexisted in one practical crystal. Herein, the first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical application. It has a sufficiently large nonlinearity and a deep&#8208;ultraviolet phase matching wavelength, indicating that it holds great potential for the production of coherent light below 200&#8197;nm. The critical performance enhancement of MgB5O7F3 when compared with its isomorphic phases was demonstrated and discussed. More importantly, we proposed that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electro&#8208;reforming of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Vertically Oriented Nickel Nanosheet/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts: Structure&#8211;Function Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable electro&#8208;reforming of HMF into FDCA on a Ni nanosheet/carbon paper electrode is achieved at a potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with 99.7&#8201;% conversion. A precursor&#8208;limiting electrodeposition method creates a unique Ni nanosheet forest structure with vastly different physical appearance and catalytic activity comparing with conventional Ni catalysts.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;promoted electrocatalytic biomass reforming has shown promising prospect in enabling high value&#8208;added product synthesis. Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) at low potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with high stability. The post&#8208;reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)x during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway. This work emphasizes the importance of the precise control of Ni activity via atomic structure engineering.

         <title>Heterometallic Coinage Metal Acetylenediide Clusters Showing Tailored Thermochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of heterometallic coinage metal acetylenediide clusters (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgM6 (M=Ag/Cu) were prepared via a heterometallic precursor approach. They are isostructural but display different thermochromic luminescence. The replacement of silver with copper changes the HOMO character to induce dual&#8208;emission in (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgCu6, and this dual&#8208;emission is associated from two emissive states favored at different temperatures.







Abstract
Acetelyenediide (C22&#8722;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)6Ag7(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (2) and [(AuL)6AgCu6(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (3), L=phenylbis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in 2 are replaced with copper in 3. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;AuL)M2Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu&#8208;doping significantly increases the energy level of (C2&#8208;Cu)&#8208;involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual&#8208;emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi&#8208;congeneric metal components.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [(AuL)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;AgCu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), L=phenylbis(2-pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are replaced with copper in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu-C&#8801;C-AuL)M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu-doping significantly increases the energy level of (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu)-involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual-emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi-congeneric metal components.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was discovered to boost the rechargeable persistent luminescence performance of the persistent luminescence nanoparticles. The dye sensitized nanoparticles are used for PersL imaging guided tumorectomy. They provide simultaneous enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background afterglow intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and simple microscopic fluorescent cellular imaging.







Abstract
Owing to their unique afterglow ability, long&#8208;wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. Long&#8208;wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long&#8208;wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC)) under long&#8208;wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis.

         <title>Human Oxygenase Variants Employing a Single Protein FeII Ligand Are Catalytically Active</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate and FeII dependent oxygenase was engineered to possess only one protein FeII binding ligand. The resultant variants retained significant levels of catalytic activity. Biomimetic catalysts containing only one metal binding site are therefore of interest.







Abstract
Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and FeII oxygenase that catalyses C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate FeII rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its FeII binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variants retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>Semiconductor Bow&#8208;Tie Nanoantenna from Coupled Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral nanocrystal quantum dots yielded the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna architecture, which manifests an electromagnetic&#8208;photocatalyitic hotspot at its epicenter.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials show powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. We synthesize the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bow&#8208;tie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bow&#8208;tie axis, as predicted theoretically and revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bow&#8208;tie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light&#8208;induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions, thus demonstrating bow&#8208;tie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center.

         <title>Discovery of Oligosaccharide Antigens for Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads against Streptococcus suis Serotypes 2, 3, 9 and&#8197;14**
</title>

         <dc:description>
30 novel oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharides related to four major serotypes (2, 3, 9, 14) of Streptococcus suis (S.&#8197;suis) were synthesized. The conjugation&#8208;ready glycans were used to screen the sera of pigs and rabbits. With a glycan array study, glycan epitopes of lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines to protect from S.&#8197;suis serotypes 2 and 9 were identified.







Abstract
Streptococcus suis bacteria are one of the most serious health problems for pigs and an emerging zoonotic agent in humans working in the swine industry. S.&#8197;suis bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPS) a major bacterial virulence factor that define the serotypes. Oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of S. suis serotypes 2, 3, 9, and 14 have been synthesized, glycans related to serotypes 2 and 9 were placed on glycan array surfaces to screen blood from infected pigs. Lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic S. suis serotypes 2 and 9 glycoconjugate veterinary vaccines were identified in this way.

         <title>XFEL Crystal Structures of Peroxidase Compound II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning of heme reactivity: Free&#8208;electron laser crystal structures of two different heme&#8208;containing peroxidases&#8212;cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase&#8212;show differences in the nature of the ferryl species. Precise enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning within structurally similar heme active sites is implicated.







Abstract
Oxygen activation in all heme enzymes requires the formation of high oxidation states of iron, usually referred to as ferryl heme. There are two known intermediates: Compound I and Compound II. The nature of the ferryl heme&#8212;and whether it is an FeIV=O or FeIV&#8208;OH species&#8212;is important for controlling reactivity across groups of heme enzymes. The most recent evidence for Compound I indicates that the ferryl heme is an unprotonated FeIV=O species. For Compound II, the nature of the ferryl heme is not unambiguously established. Here, we report 1.06&#8197;&#197; and 1.50&#8197;&#197; crystal structures for Compound II intermediates in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), collected using the X&#8208;ray free electron laser at SACLA. The structures reveal differences between the two peroxidases. The iron&#8208;oxygen bond length in CcP (1.76&#8197;&#197;) is notably shorter than in APX (1.87&#8197;&#197;). The results indicate that the ferryl species is finely tuned across Compound I and Compound II species in closely related peroxidase enzymes. We propose that this fine&#8208;tuning is linked to the functional need for proton delivery to the heme.

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable photoluminescence tuning of ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], and its potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopic applications is demonstrated.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor with emission peak at 965&#8197;nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217&#8197;nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892&#8197;nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], which can be ascribed to the upshift of 4T2g energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235&#8197;nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise regulation of protein activity is important to understand complex biological signaling networks and to devise new therapeutic approaches. Here, we use either polyaptamers or split aptamer&#8208;conjugated AuNPs to inhibit the activity of thrombin. Mechanical force generated by ultrasound is exploited to activate thrombin, thereby catalyzing the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen.







Abstract
The regulation of enzyme activity is a method to control biological function. We report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for secondary hemostasis. First, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin, inhibiting its catalytic activity. With ultrasound generating inertial cavitation and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound, the interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved, restoring the activity to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Second, we used split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates reversibly disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. We envision that this approach will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli in the sonogenetics field.

         <title>Introduction of Photolatent Bases for Locally Controlling Dynamic Exchange Reactions in Thermo&#8208;Activated Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vitrimers are covalently crosslinked polymers capable of rearranging their network topology through thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions. However, a locally controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions at elevated temperatures is a major challenge. A fundamental concept is demonstrated that enables controlled and, moreover, spatially resolved topology rearrangements triggerable by UV irradiation.







Abstract
Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure, as is characteristic of classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serious lack of methods that enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above Tv. Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8211;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network's Tv, only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterification in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization at the Alkane/Ionic Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface has been designed. The extendibility, designability, and controllability brought by the ionic liquid replace the instability and low solubility caused by water in conventional polymerization. The polyamide nanofilms synthesized at the new delicate water&#8208;insoluble monomer interfaces possess adjustable pore size and exhibit unprecedented performance in various separation applications.







Abstract
Polymerization at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface has attracted much attention for synthesizing ultrathin polymer films for molecular sieving. However, it remains a major challenge to conduct this process outside the alkane&#8211;water interface since it not only suffers water&#8208;caused side reactions but also is limited to water&#8208;soluble monomers. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface (IP@AILI) where the ionic liquid acts as the universal solvent for diversified amines to synthesize task&#8208;specific polyamide nanofilms. We propose that IP@AILI occurs when acyl chloride diffuses from the alkane into the ionic liquid instead of being triggered by the diffusion of amines as in the conventional alkane&#8211;water system, which is demonstrated by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic monitoring. The prepared polyamide nanofilms with precisely adjustable pore sizes display unprecedented permeability and selectivity in various separation processes.

         <title>pH&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoparticles for In Vivo Imaging of Tumor Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating nanoprobes dually respond to acidity and myeloperoxidase of phagosome in inflammatory macrophages were synthesized. The nanoparticles exhibit excellent imaging capability for identification of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in diverse animal tumor models.







Abstract
Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100&#8211;200&#8197;mm3).

         <title>Off&#8208;Set Interactions of Ruthenium&#8211;bda Type Catalysts for Promoting Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the position of substituents on the axial ligand of the popular Ru(bda)L2 water&#8208;splitting catalyst can enable catalysis at low concentrations with high turnover frequencies. Kinetic results indicate superiority of asymmetric catalysts and DFT studies show that this is through positioning of two catalytic units in parallel planes minimizing the X&#8211;&#960; distance and optimizing stacking.







Abstract
O&#8722;O bond formation with Ru(bda)L2&#8208;type catalysts is well&#8208;known to proceed through a bimolecular reaction pathway, limiting the potential application of these catalysts at low concentrations. Herein, we achieved high efficiencies with mononuclear catalysts, with TOFs of 460&#177;32&#8197;s&#8722;1 at high catalyst loading and 31&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 at only 1&#8197;&#956;M catalyst concentration, by simple structural considerations on the axial ligands. Kinetic and DFT studies show that introduction of an off&#8208;set in the interaction between the two catalytic units reduces the kinetic barrier of the second&#8208;order O&#8722;O bond formation, maintaining high catalytic activity even at low catalyst concentrations. The results herein furthermore suggest that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions may only play a minor role in the observed catalytic activity, and that asymmetry can also rationalize high activity observed for Ru(bda)(isoq)2 type catalysts and offer inspiration to overcome the limitations of 2nd order catalysis.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of continuous flow reactors enabled previously inaccessible enzyme combinations in multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions. This included combination of oxidases with aminating biocatalysts (transaminase/reductive aminase) and was extended to the continuous in situ biocatalytic generation of amino donors for the reductive aminase.







Abstract
A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross&#8208;reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Aminoarylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes by Merging Photoredox with Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. The radical cascade features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved as well as 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethoxy carbonyl protected &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;oxy acids are used as amidyl radical precursors. anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of the amidyl radical to the alkene and Ni&#8208;mediated radical/transition metal cross over lead to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation product. The radical cascade, which can be conducted under practical and mild conditions, features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved using a L&#8208;(+)&#8208;lactic acid derived vinyl ether as the substrate, offering a novel route for the preparation of protected enantiopure &#945;&#8208;arylated &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. In addition, 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers is achieved by using an acyl succinimide as the electrophile for the Ni&#8208;mediated radical coupling.

         <title>Observation of Borane&#8211;Olefin Proximity Interaction Governing the Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With borane&#8208;containing macrocyclic polyenes obtained by multi&#8208;step insertion of a strained alkyne into 9&#8208;borafluorene, the first direct crystallographic evidence of attractive borane&#8211;olefin interaction, which is beyond van der Waals force and governs the reactivity of the molecules, is provided.







Abstract
While attractive interactions between borane and olefin have been postulated to trigger various boron&#8208;mediated organic transformations, proximity structures of these functional groups, other than the formation of weak van der Waals complexes, have never been directly observed. Here we show that a close intramolecular borane&#8211;olefin interaction operates in macrocyclic systems containing borane and olefinic groups obtained by multi&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;carboboration between a strained alkyne and 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives. Depending on Lewis acidity of the borane moiety and the size of the macrocycles, the magnitude of interaction changes, resulting in different reaction modes. The whole picture of the multi&#8208;step reactions has been revealed experimentally with theoretical supports. The present finding may not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental boron&#8208;mediated interaction but also lead to the development of new organic transformations involving molecular activation by boranes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Alkene Hydromethylation via Protonolysis of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the direct Markovnikov hydromethylation of unactivated alkenes by protonolysis of titanacyclobutanes has been developed. This approach enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a methyl group into complex, polyfunctional molecules and has been demonstrated with a series of mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.







Abstract
Methyl groups are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules. Thus, new tactics to introduce this alkyl fragment into polyfunctional structures are of significant interest. With this goal in mind, a direct method for the Markovnikov hydromethylation of alkenes is reported. This method exploits the degenerate metathesis reaction between the titanium methylidene unveiled from Cp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#956;&#8208;CH2)AlMe2 (Tebbe's reagent) and unactivated alkenes. Protonolysis of the resulting titanacyclobutanes in&#8197;situ effects hydromethylation in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and site&#8208;selective manner. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated across a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.
