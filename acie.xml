         <dc:description>
Puzzling of ligands at C(0): In their Research Article (e202415228), Max M. Hansmann et&#8197;al. demonstrate a new strategy to afford stable diazoalkenes by cleavage of a carbophosphinocarbene and carbodicarbenes with N2O. The follow&#8208;up N2/NHC exchange allows easy access to novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds. The combination of exchange reactions overall allows to &#8220;puzzle&#8221; the fragments at a C(0) atom.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Free Alkaline Polyelectrolytes for Water Electrolyzers: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for realizing sustainable society. AEMs as the core component of AEMWEs determine the longevity and efficiency of the system. Ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes have shown great advantages in chemical stability. This review focuses on the preparation and modification strategies of ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes and their degradation mechanism in AEMWE systems.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether&#8208;free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvation via Ion Dipole Interactions for Low&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;concentrated and fluorine&#8208;free ether&#8208;based electrolyte is developed to sustain lithium batteries working at high voltage and low temperature. Based on ion dipole interaction and competitive adsorption in electric double layer, the enhanced stability of electrolyte correlates with the evolution of solvation environment from bulk electrolyte to interface and the formation of antioxidant cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).







Abstract
Extending the stability of ether solvents is pivotal for developing low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722; and difluoro (oxalato) borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether&#8208;Li+&#8208;anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high&#8208;voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent&#8208;deficient electric double layer and an anti&#8208;oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 93.12&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% at both 25 and &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Front Cover: Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry can be used in the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as reported by Xavier Ottenwaelder, Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263;, Dmytro F. Perepichka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404539). Based on this concept the first mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;based 2D and 3D COFs with high surface area of up to 2,500 m2 g&#8722;1 was developed. The cover picture shows the structure of the monomers and the COF with the electron micrograph of the mechanochemically prepared COF in the background.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Framework&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based spherical nucleic acid (tDF&#8208;SNA) with a dynamic, spiky interface is developed to improve siRNA delivery efficiency. This system largely enhances siRNA duplex efficiency, promotes cellular uptake, and facilitates cytoplasmic access. Consequently, tDF&#8208;SNA effectively delivers siRNA into the cytoplasm, leading to increased gene silencing efficacy.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work examines how steaming affects the material&#8216;s properties and influences the organic reaction mechanism in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol conversion process.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.&#8201;g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) interactions as a reversible network element to control the communication between stimuli&#8208;responses and self&#8208;assembly. This approach broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a two&#8208;component system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Unprecedented Photoinduced&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Probe with a Turn&#8208;ON Chemiluminescence Mode&#8208;of&#8208;Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe utilizing a chemiluminescent mechanism is presented. The probe is activated through a reaction between a quenched dioxetane&#8208;azide and a strained cycloalkyne, resulting in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise protein detection and outperforming a fluorescent analog.







Abstract
PeT&#8208;based fluorescent probes were demonstrated to be powerful tools for detection and imaging, owing to their significant fluorescence enhancement in response to specific targets. While numerous examples of fluorescence&#8208;based PeT have been frequently reported, there is not even a single example of a PeT probe that operates via a chemiluminescence mode. Here we report the first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe that acts via a chemiluminescent operation mode. We designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel chemiluminescent probe, featuring a PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on mechanism. The probe consists of a phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane, linked to an azide unit that acts as a PeT quencher. Upon cycloaddition of a strained cycloalkyne with the azide, a triazole&#8208;dioxetane is formed, which undergoes relatively slow chemiexcitation, resulting in a measurement window with an exceptionally high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (over 5000&#8208;fold). The PeT&#8208;dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc&#8208;DBCO and Max&#8208;DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT&#8208;based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT&#8208;quenching pathways.

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active sites was developed to comediate adsorption and electron transfer. Specially, F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) enriched at N sites to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), facilitating the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH).







Abstract
Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge challenge because of the stability of extractants. Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation results in unsatisfactory &#8901;OH utilization and organics removal. Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and F sites activate H2O2, shortening the migration distance of &#8901;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) extraction wastewater degradation experiment showed that F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to H2O2, facilitating the continuous generation of &#8901;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2 activation. As a result, 96.49&#8201;% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater and 90.26&#8201;% total organic carbon in real extraction wastewater were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides an effective strategy for Fenton&#8208;like reaction to treat refractory extraction wastewater, promoting sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.

         <title>Tuning Proton Affinity on Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Atomic Interface to Disentangle Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Acidic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing proton affinity over Co&#8722;N&#8722;C atomic interface via B doping is shown to direct proton attack to the former oxygen in *OOH, facilitating H2O2 formation without sacrificing activity. The obtained Co1&#8208;NBC catalyst exhibits remarkable 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity at the same time, achieving ultrahigh H2O2 production ability.







Abstract
In oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2 via two&#8208;electron pathway (2e&#8722; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN4 (Co1&#8208;NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H2O2 formation. As a result, Co1&#8208;NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724&#8197;V vs. RHE and H2O2 selectivity of 94&#8201;%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co1&#8208;NBC exhibits a remarkable H2O2 productivity of 202.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable stability of 60&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. This work provides new insights into resolving activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple fusion of a Ni(II) norcorrole unit with anthracene units deforms the antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated core into a bowl&#8208;shaped conformation, which enables effective fullerene binding in the solution and solid states via convex&#8211;concave interactions. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the anthracene moieties enhances the absorption bands into the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region. The NIR&#8208;absorbing properties of the fused anthrylnorcorroles together with their antiaromatic character induce effective photothermal&#8208;conversion properties.







Abstract
The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules is challenging because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900&#8197;nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.59&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Silver Clusters from Ag57 to Ag72 via Laminating Multiple Different Anion Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike previous approaches that employed single or double hetero&#8208;anion templates, the current research introduces a groundbreaking strategy using multiple distinct types of anion templates with varying sizes, geometries, and charge states. By deliberately introducing a third SO42&#8722; anion template to a hetero&#8208;anion (Cl&#8722; and lacunary [SiW9O34]10&#8722;) templated system, a pioneering example of longitudinal epitaxial growth from Ag57 to Ag72 has been realized. These findings underscore the significance of multiple anion&#8208;template strategy in advancing high&#8208;nuclearity silver clusters.







Abstract
The established capability of anion templates in precisely manipulating the size, geometry, and function of metal clusters is well acknowledged. However, the development of a systematic methodology for orchestrating the assembly of silver clusters, particularly those encompassing multiple distinct types of anion templates, remains elusive due to the formidable synthetic challenge. In this work, we report two novel silver clusters, Ag57 and Ag72, using two and three different anion templates, respectively. Ag57 features a gyroscope&#8208;like monovalent cation with an Ag3 triangle core sandwiched by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722; and a triad of Cl&#8722; anion templates. By intentionally introducing the third anion template, SO42&#8722;, the structure is expanded to the unprecedented Ag72 (with 15&#8197;silver atoms epitaxially grown on top of Ag57) resembling a tumbler, inside of which two Ag3 layers are laminated by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722;, seven Cl&#8722; and one SO42&#8722; anion templates in parallel with respect to longitudinal orientation. It is noteworthy that Ag72 exhibits remarkable structural complexity and represents a pioneering achievement as the first silver cluster incorporating three distinct types of anion templates. In addition, Ag72 demonstrates a significant advantage over Ag57, particular in terms of applications such as luminescent thermometers and remote laser ignition. This work not only broadens the horizon for precise control of the silver cluster structures through the integration of multiple types of hetero&#8208;anions but also lays a solid foundation for potential optical applications in the future.

         <dc:description>
Piano stool rhodium complexes, which are derived from helicene&#8208;indene proligands, can catalyse enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation leading to axially chiral biaryls in mostly high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Stereocontrolled synthesis of such complexes and their use in catalysis expresses an unusual sequence of central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer, as reported by Tereza Edlov&#225;, Irena G. Star&#225;, Ivo Star&#253; et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202414698).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation of Mo3Nb2O14 bronze occurs with near&#8208;zero volume change, which arises from rotation and shrinkage of the flexible MOn framework (M = Mo, Nb) as reported by Kosuke Kawai et al. in their Research Article (e202410971). As a result, the Mo3Nb2O14 particle maintains high crystallinity after repeating proton (de)intercalation, which contributes to high Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term charge/discharge operation of an aqueous proton battery.

         <title>Back Cover: Target&#8208;templated Construction of Functional Proteomimetics Using Photo&#8208;foldamer Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat protein surfaces involved in protein&#8211;protein interactions are notoriously difficult targets. In their Research Article (e202410435), Tam&#225;s A. Martinek, Gy&#246;rgy M. Keser&#369; et&#8197;al. addressed this challenge by creating a protein surface&#8208;compatible library of short helical foldamers that can be used as fragments. The light&#8208;induced photoscreening enabled the capture and localization of the weak binding of the helices to the target. Protein&#8208;templated linking of the initial hits to dimeric compounds increased their affinity and resulted in functional proteomimetics.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, they have not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. In their Research Article (e202410109), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Lingwen Liao et al. report a novel nanocluster with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB, and demonstrate the effectiveness of manipulating GBs for enhancing the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts.

         <title>Halogen Radical&#8208;Activated Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Buried Heterointerface for Achieving Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Tin&#8208;Based Solar Cells with Efficiencies Surpassing 14%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by the costly hole transport layer (HTL) and the under&#8208;optimized interfacial carrier dynamics. Here, we innovatively developed a halogen radical chemical bridging&#160;strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the perovskite&#8208;substrate heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance, simplified Sn&#8208;based PSCs. The modification of ITO electrode by&#160;highly active chlorine radicals&#160;could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier was reduced by 0.20 eV and the carrier dynamics were optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs was enhanced from 6.79% to 14.20%, representing&#160;the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for 2000 h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to construct Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27% and 21.13%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Protein&#8208;Protein Communication for Field&#8208;Deployable Cell&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural protein&#8208;protein communications, such as those between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerases/ribosomes, underpin cell&#8208;free biosensing systems operating on the transcription/translation (TXTL) paradigm. However, their deployment in field analysis is hampered by the delayed response (hour&#8208;level) and the complex composition of in vitro TXTL systems. For this purpose, we present a de novo&#8208;designed ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8208;protein communication (LIRAC) by redefining the connection between TFs and non&#8208;interacting CRISPR/Cas enzymes. By rationally designing a chimeric DNA adaptor and precisely regulating its binding affinities to both proteins, LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into rapid CRISPR/Cas enzyme activation within a homogenous system. Consequently, LIRAC obviates the need for RNA/protein biosynthesis inherent to conventional TXTL&#8208;based cell&#8208;free systems, substantially reducing reaction complexity and time (from hours to 10 minutes) with improved sensitivity and tunable dynamic range. Moreover, LIRAC exhibits excellent versatility and programmability for rapidly and sensitively detecting diverse contaminants, including antibiotics, heavy metal ions, and preservatives. It also enables the creation of a multi&#8208;protein communication&#8208;based tristate logic for the intelligent detection of multiple contaminants. Integrated with portable devices, LIRAC has been proven effective in the field analysis of environmental samples and personal care products, showcasing its potential for environmental and health monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000 nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3 eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate&#160;Diagnosis&#160;and Efficient&#160;Clearance of&#160;Metastatic&#160;Lymph Nodes</title>

         <dc:description>Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC was easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggered the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes was achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Propeller&#8208;Shaped Blatter&#8208;Based Triradicals: Distortion&#8208;Free Triangular Spin System and Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Dependent Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable radical trimers. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped trimers were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interaction J/kB ~ &#8722;120 K and &#8211;106 K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The trimers exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000 nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monomer&#8208;like excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Nanozymes for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global crisis of bacterial infections is exacerbated by the escalating threat of microbial antibiotic resistance. Nanozymes promise to provide ingenious solutions. Here, we reported a homogeneous catalytic structure of Pt nanoclusters with finely tuned metal&#8208;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) channel structures for the treatment of infected wounds. Catalytic site normalization showed that the active site of the Pt aggregates structure with fine&#8208;tuned pore modifications structure had a catalytic capacity of 14.903 &#215;105 min&#8208;1, which was 18.7 times higher than that of the Pt particles in monodisperse state in ZIF&#8208;8 (0.793 &#215;105 min&#8208;1). In situ tests revealed that the change from homocleavage to heterocleavage of hydrogen peroxide at the interface of the nanozyme was one of the key reasons for the improvement of nanozyme activity. Density&#8208;functional theory and kinetic simulations of the reaction interface jointly determine the role of the catalytic center and the substrate channel together. Metabolomics analysis showed that the developed nanozyme, working in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, could effectively block energy metabolic pathways within bacteria, leading to spontaneous apoptosis and bacterial rupture. This pioneering study elucidates new ideas for the regulation of artificial enzyme activity and provides new perspectives for the development of efficient antibiotic substitutes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843 cm&#8208;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Regeneration of Industrial LiFePO4 Black Mass Through A Glycerol&#8208;Enabled Granule Reconstruction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing sales of electric vehicles, lots of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) assembled with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes will retire in the next few years, posing a significant challenge for their effective and environmentally&#8208;friendly recycling. The main reason why spent LFP cathodes fail to re&#8208;utilize lies in the lattice defects caused by lithium loss and structural defects resulting from stress accumulation. In this work, we propose an in&#8208;situ granule reconstruction strategy to directly regenerate spent LFP black mass (S&#8208;BM) using glycerol in industry settings. The hydroxyl groups abundant in glycerol serves as electron donor that help reduce Fe (III) and repair Fe&#8211;Li antisite defects (FeLi). Additionally, the chelating properties of glycerol intervene with structurally disintegrated particles, inhibiting Oswald ripening effect and promoting bonding of grain boundaries to generate lamellar microcrystals with homogeneous grain size, recover their morphology and crystal structure after a facile annealing procedure. Furthermore, the regenerated LFP restores Fe&#8211;O bonds which further inhibits structural distortion and improve Li+ migration kinetics. As a result, the regenerated industrial LFP black mass (R&#8208;BM) exhibits superior lithium storage performance with a discharge capacity of 123.2 mA h g&#8211;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 C (a capacity retention rate of 93.1%).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is achieved in moderate to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity, based on the proposed nucleophilic [Cu]&#8208;AsPh2 species. As for &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, a 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination/enantioselective protonation event occurs smoothly in satisfying results. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amide, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfide are well applied in the present catalytic system. Finally, some control experiments show that HAsPh2 is activated through coordination with the copper(I) catalyst and HAsPh2 exhibits inferior soft Lewis basicity to HPPh2 in the presence of a copper(I)&#8208;bisphosphine complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Freestanding Phosphonium Covalent Organic Frameworks with Efficient Hydroxide Conduction for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their well&#8208;defined crystalline pore structures and ordered functional ionic groups along the skeleton, ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) exhibit excellent performance and have significant potential for use in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we for the first time developed cationic phosphonium COFs with high hydroxide conduction even with low ion exchange capacity (IEC). Specifically, we synthesized COFs containing quaternary phosphonium groups as excellent ion transport moieties. Then, we fabricated freestanding phosphonium membranes through a vapor&#8208;assisted method, which exhibited high hydroxide conductivity of 126 mS cm&#8211;1 at 80 &#176;C from a minimal IEC of 1.17 mmol g&#8211;1. The resulting film was successfully applied to zinc&#8211;air batteries, demonstrating energy density of 96.1 mW cm&#8211;2, specific capacity of 95.0 mAh cm&#8211;2, and stable operation over 2,300 min. Overall, in addition to investigating a novel cationic functional group, we demonstrated a freestanding film formation method of COF&#8208;based materials. The findings can provide a solid foundation for advancing the field of iCOFs to ion transport and promoting electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Phenothiazine Dioxide via External Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing pure organic materials with ultralong lifetimes and balanced quantum efficiency is attractive but challenging. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to investigate external heavy atoms by linking molecular emitters with halogen through a flexible alkyl chain. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis clearly reveal the halogen C&#8208;X&#8208;&#960; interactions, which can be tuned by halogen donors, as well as the distance and geometry between them. Impressively, DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl featuring a chloride atom as donor, exhibits a balanced long phosphorescence lifetime of 1351 ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1%. We also first demonstrate that Cl can induce more positive effect than heavier halogens (Br and I) on prolonging the lifetime. We envisage that the present study will expedite new molecular design to manipulate the room temperature phosphorescence via external heavy atom effect, and highlight a special C&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction for the development of ultralong phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen&#8208;bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.







Abstract
Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

         <title>Early Detection of High&#8208;Altitude Hypoxic Brain Injury by In Vivo Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a strategy based on in vivo electrochemistry for early detecting high&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI). The characteristic changes in the brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given that brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the risk of HHBI can be prognosed 3&#8197;days in advance according to the characteristics of brain oxygen change within initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;hours of high&#8208;altitude exposure.







Abstract
High&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) is a kind of acute mountain sickness and the survival rate of patients with HHBI can be improved only if it is detected and treated at the early stage. However, limited by speediness and accuracy, it is still very difficult for most of current approaches to realize the early detection of HHBI. We propose herein a novel strategy for this goal based on spatiotemporal changes in the brain oxygen level. As revealed by in vivo electrochemistry, the characteristic changes of brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure are directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the degree of HHBI can be diagnosed by the variation of brain oxygen, making the early detection of HHBI feasible. In addition, the risk of HHBI for mouse exposed to high&#8208;altitude hypoxia environments can be also prognosed days in advance.

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a chemical transformation that exploits the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction catalytically is presented. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silylating reagents, various (hetero)aryl bromides have been converted to the corresponding organosilicon compounds using inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters. Mechanistic studies point to the involvement of tert&#8208;butylsodium (tBuNa) that mediates the key Na/Br exchange event.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8722;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8722;Br metalating agent.

Using stable &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-substituted silyldiazenes (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as silylating reagents, various (hetero)aryl bromides have been converted to the corresponding organosilicon compounds using inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters. Mechanistic studies point to the involvement of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylsodium (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuNa) that mediates the key Na/Br exchange event.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal-halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium-bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Br bonds in a transition metal-free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-silyldiazenes (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#8722;N=N&#8722;&lt;i&gt;Si&lt;/i&gt;) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl sodium as the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Br metalating agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a mesoionic diazasilole featuring a low&#8208;valent silicon center that exhibits properties characteristic of both mesoionic silylene and silylone. Preliminary reactivity studies, including coordination with transition metals, oxidation, silicon atom transfer, ring saturation, ring contraction, and skeletal rearrangement, have yielded an array of novel silicon&#8208;based heterocycles.







Abstract
A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.

         <title>Modular Design and Scaffold&#8208;Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Functional Fluorophores for Targeted Cellular Imaging and Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach is established to synthesize multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffolding approach using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction. The characterization and applications of a small library of such probes with fluorogenic character for optical imaging and theranostics are shown. The probes can be equipped with distinct cellular localization signals and can induce programmed cell death.







Abstract
Fluorophores are essential tools for optical imaging and biomedical research. Their synthetic modification to incorporate new functions, however, remains a challenging task. Conventional strategies rely on linear synthesis in which a parent framework is gradually extended. We here designed and synthesized a versatile library of multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffold&#8208;based Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (U&#8208;4CR). The adaptability of the scaffold is achieved through modification of starting materials. This allows to use a small range of starting materials for the creation of fluorogenic probes that can detect reactive&#8208;oxygen species and where the localization into subcellular organelles or membranes can be controlled. We present reaction yields ranging from 60&#8201;% to 90&#8201;% and discovered that some compounds can even function as imaging and therapeutic agents via Fenton chemistry inducing pyroptosis in living cancer cells. Our study underlines the potential of scaffold&#8208;based synthesis for versatile creation of functional fluorophores and their applications.

         <title>Stable and Recyclable Copper Nanoclusters with Exposed Active Sites for Broad&#8208;Scope Protosilylation in Open Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of maleonitriledithiolate ligands allows for the straightforward synthesis of stable, atomically precise Cu6 nanoclusters with exposed copper active sites in gram scales. These recyclable cluster&#8208;based copper catalysts efficiently promote the protosilylation of C&#8722;C multiple bonds under ambient conditions, with a broad substrate scope and high turnover numbers, demonstrating their considerable promise for practical synthetic applications.







Abstract
Despite recent advances in cluster&#8208;based catalysis for organic synthesis, the substrate scope of reactions catalyzed by metal nanoclusters is typically not superior to previously established catalytic systems. Herein, we develop new atomically precise copper nanoclusters for protosilylation, with scope expanding to alkenes and simple enynes that were not suitable for prior synthetic methodologies with traditional copper complexes. The involvement of a second copper center in the metal kernel during the migratory insertion step is thought to be responsible for the expanded scope. In addition, the reaction is highly compatible with water and can be carried out in open air rather than under inert gas protection. Mechanistic studies suggest that the cluster&#8208;catalyzed protosilylation proceeds in the absence of silyl radicals. The current findings demonstrate the potential of using metal nanoclusters for practical and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Anisotropic Hollow Structure with Chemotaxis Enabling Intratumoral Autonomic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic hollow multishell structures (HoMS) with chemotaxis capabilities for intratumoral autonomic therapy are fabricated in one step. These structures exhibit a superior diffusion coefficient and directionality, realizing positive chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. The anisotropic HoMS can reduce the glucose supply to tumors, demonstrating superior antitumor efficacy.







Abstract
Effective intratumoral drug penetration is pivotal for successful cancer treatment. However, due to the disrupted capillary networks and poor perfusion in solid tumors, there exist challenges to realize autonomous directional drug penetration and controlled drug release within the tumor. Considering the specificity of glucose within tumor tissue, we draw inspiration from nature and engineer asymmetrical hollow structures exhibiting chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. By incorporating multiple shells into these structures, we enhance the local chemical concentration gradients, thereby improving cellular uptake and precise targeting. The advantages of anisotropic hollow multishell structure (a&#8208;HoMS) can be reflected from the diffusion coefficient and directivity, which increase by 73.4&#8201;% and 273&#8201;% respectively compared to conventional isotropic hollow spheres, achieving the most linear movement while ensuring the speed of movement. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;level porosity and temporal&#8208;spatial order of a&#8208;HoMS enable sequential drug delivery that inhibits angiogenesis with inducing cell apoptosis. After the eradication of localized tumor cells, the a&#8208;HoMS can automatically migrate to the alive tumor cells under the glucose gradient, inducing another cycle of drug delivery and chemotaxis, resulting in excellent antitumor efficacy. These anisotropic HoMS demonstrate intelligence, adaptability, and precision in tumor therapy, providing valuable insights for programmable treatment within tissues.

         <title>Programming the Dynamic Range of Nanochannel Biosensors for MicroRNA Detection Through Allosteric DNA Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allosteric DNA probes were utilized to systematically adjust the dynamic range of nanochannel biosensors, resulting in a collection of sensors with notably diverse target affinities. The dynamic range was significantly extended to 10,900&#8208;fold by combining probes with varying affinities. Additionally, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor was narrowed to just a 3&#8208;fold range by employing a sequestration mechanism.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors are extensively utilized for microRNA (miRNA) detection owing to their high sensitivity and rapid response. However, conventional nanochannel biosensors face limitations in their fixed dynamic range, restricting their versatility and efficacy. Herein, we introduce tunable triblock DNA probes with varying affinities for target miRNA to engineer solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors capable of customizable dynamic range adjustment. The triblock DNA architecture comprises a poly&#8208;adenine (polyA) block for adjustable surface density anchoring, alongside stem and loop blocks for modulating structural stability. Through systematic manipulation of these blocks, we demonstrate the ability to achieve diverse target binding affinities and detection limits, achieving an initial 81&#8208;fold dynamic range. By combining probes with various affinities, we extend this dynamic range significantly to 10,900&#8208;fold. Furthermore, by implementing a sequestration mechanism, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor is narrowed to only a 3&#8208;fold span of target concentrations. The customizable dynamic range of these advanced nanochannel biosensors makes them highly promising for a broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical applications.

However, conventional nanochannel biosensors face limitations in their fixed dynamic range, restricting their versatility and efficacy. Herein, we introduce tunable triblock DNA probes with varying affinities for target miRNA to engineer solid-state nanochannel biosensors capable of customizable dynamic range adjustment. The triblock DNA architecture comprises a poly-adenine (polyA) block for adjustable surface density anchoring, alongside stem and loop blocks for modulating structural stability. Through systematic manipulation of these blocks, we demonstrate the ability to achieve diverse target binding affinities and detection limits, achieving an initial 81-fold dynamic range. By combining probes with various affinities, we extend this dynamic range significantly to 10,900-fold. Furthermore, by implementing a sequestration mechanism, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor is narrowed to only a 3-fold span of target concentrations. The customizable dynamic range of these advanced nanochannel biosensors makes them highly promising for a broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal fluorination enhances crystallinity and J&#8208;aggregate ratio of the non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptor TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, surpassing its chlorinated version. Thus, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based organic photodetectors exhibit suppressed nonradiative energy loss and more ordered active layer morphology, leading to an ultralow dark current density of 7.30&#215;10&#8208;12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exceptional detectivity over 1013 Jones in 320&#8211;920&#8197;nm wavelength, along with excellent stability.







Abstract
High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, which features fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregation compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with lower nonradiative energy loss, improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#215;10&#8208;12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8211;920&#8197;nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#215;1014 Jones at 800&#8197;nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective dehydrogenative aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl groups on Au(111) surfaces has been achieved, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene. The transformation, involving sequential C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation at C1 and C6, is confirmed by scanning probe microscopies and DFT calculations and is applicable to heteroatom&#8208;containing precursors.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel macrocyclic thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds, MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST, with varying conjugation lengths and cavity dimensions were synthesized for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 32.7&#8201;% was achieved by the device based on MC&#8208;TST, showcasing the potential of TADF macrocycles in organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8722;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9&#8201;%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85&#8201;% in 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped films, and the corresponding device&#8216;s EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7&#8201;% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylene bridges provide a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing to be both a boon and a nuisance.







Abstract
Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8722;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.

Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;-linked and 6,6&#8217;-linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet-pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore-bridge-chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report highly effective iridium&#8208;catalyzed methods for the installation of hydrogen isotopes into pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant sulfoximine&#8208;containing structures that can be conducted selectively via exchange at C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8208;centers. The utility of this catalytic platform has also been demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage and single step generation of labelled bioactive architectures and biomolecules.







Abstract
Pharmaceutical&#8208;aligned research endeavors continue to diversify, including via the installation of new chemical functionality and non&#8208;classical bioisosteres within drug design. With this, an equally high demand emerges for the direct installation of isotopic substituents into these scaffolds within drug discovery programmes, as isotopologues are essential for the elucidation of the biological efficacy and metabolic fate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The sulfoximine functional group has recently become established as a high&#8208;value unit in this context; however, general and effective methods for the synthesis of deuterium (2H, D) and tritium (3H, T) labelled analogues have remained elusive. Herein, we disclose the design and development of the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed sulfoximine&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) systems that permit the site&#8208;selective integration of a distinguishing atomic label at aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H and more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H moieties. Moreover, we exemplify the broad applicability of these methods within a spectrum of molecular settings, as well as in the late&#8208;stage generation of isotopically&#8208;enriched complex bioactive architectures.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Binding Induced Hydrogen Bond Network Connectivity on Ru&#8208;based Catalysts for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metastable Ru&#8208;based catalysts with regulated adsorption strength of hydroxyl species were synthesized for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). We unveil that the hydroxyl intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface are responsible for the increased connectivity of hydrogen bond networks in the EDL region, and the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.







Abstract
Understanding the role of adsorbed intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on the structure of electrical double layer (EDL) is essential for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we prepared a series of unconventional face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) phase Ru&#8208;based catalysts (i.e. fcc&#8208;Ru, fcc&#8208;RuCr, and fcc&#8208;RuCrW) by rational tuning the binding energetics of hydroxyl intermediate to engineer the electrochemical interface and boost the performance of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The introduction of oxyphilic metals Cr and W can regulate the orbital occupation of Ru, promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species, resulting in an anomalous behavior that HOR performance under alkaline media exceeds acidic media. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel that the modulated adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface are responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and dynamic evolution of free water molecules from nearest to the electrode surface to above the gap region in the EDL, thereby leading to significantly increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a new understanding of the surface intermediates in controlling the dynamic process of interfacial water and hydrogen bonding network in HOR electrocatalysis, and will guide rational design of advanced electrocatalysts through electrochemical interfacial engineering.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Ionic Conductivity in Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible, All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Operating at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries capable of operating at room temperature have been successfully constructed based on the photoexcitation modulation mechanism of heterojunctions fillers as well as the natural bacterial cellulose possessing excellent mechanical property and PEO compatibility. These innovations enable the lithium&#8208;metal pouch cell to achieve a high discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending/folding, while maintaining superior cycling stability at a 1 C rate (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Designing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity for room&#8208;temperature operation is essential for advancing flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state energy storage devices. Innovative strategies are urgently required to develop SPEs that are safe, stable, and high&#8208;performing. In this work, we introduce photoexcitation&#8208;modulated heterojunctions as catalytically active fillers within SPEs, guided by photocatalytic design principles, and meanwhile employ natural bacterial cellulose to improve the compatibility with poly(ethylene oxide), improve the coordination environment of lithium salts, and optimize both ion transport and mechanical properties. In situ photothermal experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong photogenerated electric field produced by trace heterojunctions within poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes under photoexcitation significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation, increasing the concentration of mobile Li+. This results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.135&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, with a Li+ transference number as high as 0.46. The flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal pouch cells exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending and folding, and demonstrate exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 86.7&#8201;% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles at 1&#8197;C (25&#8201;&#176;C). This research offers a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

Abstract
Enhancing the effectiveness of utilizing circulating cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) for disease screening remains a challenge, necessitating improved sensitivity, specificity, cost&#8208;efficiency, and patient adherence. We present here LAMP&#8208;MS, an innovative technology that integrates linear amplification with single&#8208;base quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry on silicon chips. This approach overcomes several limitations in utilizing cfDNA 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) status for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. LAMP&#8208;MS enables unbiased amplification of as little as 1&#8197;ng of cfDNA, site&#8208;specifically quantify methylation levels of multiple 5&#8197;mC sites, thereby facilitating cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution quantitative detection of cfDNA methylation markers. We have validated the accuracy of DNA methylation determination using DNA probes and cfDNA from patient plasma samples, confirmed by mass spectrometric peak areas. Additionally, we have further shown this Mass Array technology could be expanded to also quantify RNA m6A modification sites. Combining the ability to work with ultra&#8208;low input materials and a visually interpretable output, LAMP&#8208;MS stands out as a promising method for real&#8208;world applications in clinics and laboratories for nucleic acid methylation detection and quantification.

The method attaches polymer&#8208;based tris(triazolylmethyl)amine copper complex, catalyst of Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), to an antibody. Polytriazoles formed in the CuAAC reaction chelate Cu(I), speeding catalysis and boosting signal amplification. This technique effectively images live cell membrane antigens.







Abstract
Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which involves coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I), thereby promoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both in vitro and living cell membranes. This approach offers a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range ordered L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) HEI with one&#8208;dimensionally aligned Pt/Ir and Fe/Mo/Bi columns were synthesized to improve the activity (5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and selectivity (95&#8201;%) of GA via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), representing the most active electrocatalyst for selective GA production.







Abstract
The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95&#8201;%, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.

         <title>Localized Water Restriction in Ternary Eutectic Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a low&#8208;temperature eutectic electrolyte for hydrogen batteries. Using high DN co&#8208;solvents (DMSO) precisely controls hydrogen bonds and locally restricts free water, creating a new ternary eutectic electrolyte. This optimized electrolyte reduces water side effects and enables stable operation under extreme conditions, including high current density (25&#8201;&#176;C, 60&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low temperatures (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Proton batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage in extreme conditions due to the small ionic radius and efficient transport of protons. Hydrogen gas, with its low working potentials, fast kinetics, and stability, further enhances the performance of proton batteries but necessitates the development of novel electrolytes with low freezing points and reduced corrosion. This work introduces a localized water restriction strategy by incorporating a tertiary component with a high donor number, which forms strong bonds with water molecules. This approach restricts free water molecules and reduces the average hydrogen bond ratio and strength. As&#8208;prepared ternary eutectic electrolytes lowered the freezing point to &#8722;103&#8201;&#176;C, significantly lower than the traditional binary electrolyte (9.5&#8197;m H3PO4, &#8722;93&#8201;&#176;C). This electrolyte is highly compatible with the Cu0.79Co0.21[Fe(CN)6]0.64&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (CoCuHCF) cathode, reducing material dissolution and current collector corrosion. The H2||CoCuHCF battery using this electrolyte demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 23664.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, excellent performance at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, and stable cyclability over 1000&#8197;cycles (&gt;30&#8197;days) at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. These findings provide a framework for proton electrolytes, highlighting the potential of hydrogen batteries in challenging environments.

         <title>Electrothermal Conversion of Methane to Methanol at Room Temperature with Phosphotungstic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an electro&#8208;thermal process, methane is aerobically oxidized to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. This system does not require the noble metals or hazardous reaction mixtures. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at room temperature.







Abstract
Traditional methods for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol frequently require the use of noble metal catalysts or flammable H2&#8208;O2 mixtures. While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$



 with approximately 20.3&#8201;% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 

&#956;molgPTA-1h-1

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$



 catalytic activity, over 74.3&#8201;% methanol selectivity, and 10&#8197;hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a chaperone&#8208;derived Cu+&#8208;binding peptide featuring the conserved MTCGGC Cu+ binding motif, which self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers within cancer cells. These nanofibers have multiple MTCGGC Cu+&#8208;binding motifs on their surfaces, allowing for efficient capture of intracellular Cu+ ions. This process disrupts the Cu+ homeostasis network of cancer cells. Our study offers a novel therapeutic intervention targeting metal ion homeostasis in cancer.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MTCGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.

These nanofibers have multiple MTCGGC Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding motifs on their surfaces, allowing for efficient capture of intracellular Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This process disrupts the Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis network of cancer cells. Our study offers a novel therapeutic intervention targeting metal ion homeostasis in cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chaperone-inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap-FFMTCGGCR peptide self-assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; due to the presence of the unique MTCGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chaperones. Nap-FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), impairs the activity of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent co-chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap-FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self-assembly and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. We show that assembly-enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease-relevant metal ion homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence Modulation through the Inverted Energy Gap Law in Triply N&#8722;B&#8592;N&#8208;Containing Windmill&#8208;Shaped Triazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of heterocyclic molecules exhibits uncommon fluorescence phenomena, displaying more redshifted emission yet concurrently achieving heightened fluorescence efficiency, which appears to violate the established &#8220;energy gap law&#8221;. The deactivation routes are primarily governed by the energy barriers encountered in the excited states, particularly from the Franck&#8211;Condon region to the conical intersection point.







Abstract
A series of windmill&#8208;shape heterocyclic molecules containing three N&#8722;B&#8592;N units, TBN and its derivatives, with quasi&#8208;planar C3 symmetric backbone, are synthesized. The parent TBN exhibits a strongly allowed, doubly degenerate lowest excited state but suffers from very low fluorescence, due to very fast nonradiative decay rate through a conical intersection (CI) as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Introducing peripheral phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;groups (Ph&#8208;TBN or Th&#8208;TBN) induces pronounced bathochromic shifts and enhances fluorescence, which is beneficial from inhibited nonradiative pathway by the increased energy barriers to access the CI at excited state. The understanding of this rather uncommon behaviour may open routes for the design of novel fluorescence materials.

         <title>Proton Relays in Molecular Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation: Lessons From the Mimicry of Hydrogenases and Electrochemical Kinetic Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the role of proton relays at the active sites of hydrogenases, highlighting their significance in hydrogen evolution and oxidation. It then explores biomimetic and bioinspired systems containing such proton relays from the literature, discusses the electrochemical framework for enhancing catalysis, and identifies key parameters for achieving bidirectional and reversible catalysis.







Abstract
The active sites of metalloenzymes involved in small molecules activation often contain pendant bases that act as proton relay promoting proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes. Here we focus on hydrogenases and on the reactions they catalyze, i.&#8201;e. the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. After a short description of these enzymes, we review some of the various biomimetic and bioinspired molecular systems that contain proton relays. We then provide the formal electrochemical framework required to decipher the key role of such proton relay to enhance catalysis in a single direction and discuss the few systems active for H2 evolution for which quantitative kinetic data are available. We finally highlight key parameters required to reach bidirectional catalysis (both hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation catalyzed) and then transition to reversible catalysis (both reactions catalyzed in a narrow potential range) as well as illustrate these features on few systems from the literature.

         <title>Photoinduced Bartoli Indole Synthesis by the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes with Nitro(hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis was first reported for the construction of indoles and azaindoles by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. The novel reactivity of N&#8722;O=C dipoles, involving the rearrangement of carbonyl imines, enhances the comprehension of dipole chemistry.







Abstract
Given the unique charm of dipole chemistry, intercepting N&#8722;O=C dipoles precisely generated by designed processes to develop novel reactivity has become a seminal challenge. The polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species generated through the radical addition of excited nitro(hetero)arenes to alkenes represents a significantly underappreciated mechanism for generating N&#8722;O=C dipoles. Herein, we present a photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. Various indoles and azaindoles are constructed through the multi&#8208;step spontaneous rearrangement of carbonyl imine intermediates generated by the polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations support that the reaction involves radical cycloaddition, ozonolysis&#8208;type cycloreversion, intramolecular H&#8208;shift of carbonyl imines, and 3,3&#8208;sigmatropic shift of O&#8208;Alkenyl hydroxylamines, etc. The implementation of continuous&#8208; flow photochemistry, in particular, significantly enhances efficiency, thereby overcoming obstacles to the commercialization process.

         <title>Promoting Charge&#8208;Carriers Dynamics by Relaxed Lattice Strain in A&#8208;site&#8208;Doped Halide Perovskite for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;active alkali metal was doped into CsPbBr3, and the occupied locations were first revealed, which would change from A&#8208;site to interstitial site with K+ concentrations increased. Because of relaxed lattice strain, charge&#8208;carriers dynamics were promoted, leading to an ~11&#8208;fold enhancement of solar hydrogen generation rate for CsPbBr3 with K+ A&#8208;site doping.







Abstract
Because of the unique and superior optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted great interest in photocatalysis. Element doping strategy is adopted to modify perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance. However, the contribution of bare doping&#8208;site onto photocatalytic efficiency, and the correlation between doping locations and activity have not yet to be demonstrated. The unique properties of non&#8208;active alkali metals promoted us to systematically explore the potential of A&#8208;site&#8208;doped MHPs for photocatalysis. Herein, we dope potassium (K+) into CsPbBr3 via an anti&#8208;solvent precipitation method and first reveal that the occupied locations of K+ in CsPbBr3 is lattice incorporation rather than surface segregation, which would change from A&#8208;site substitution to interstitial site in lattice with the increase of K+ concentrations. Taking hydrogen (H2) evolution as a model reaction, photocatalytic activity of CsPbBr3 after K+ doping could be significantly improved ~11&#8208;fold with A&#8208;site substitution, which is superior to that of interstitial site doping. Moreover, other alkali metals including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and rubidium (Rb) doping give the same results. The structure of photocatalysts during reaction confirmed the contribution of A&#8208;site doping onto enhanced photocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights show it is a result of the relaxed lattice strain induced promoted charge&#8208;carriers dynamics and upward shifting of band after K+ A&#8208;site doping.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides Facilitates Stereospecific SuFEx Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot procedural for convenient preparation of chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs). The rational screening of Cl+ and F+ as oxidation reagent allows for the enantioselective and stereospecific conversion of S(II) into chiral S(VI). The critical step includes a enantioselective hydrolysis reaction. The obtained SIFs allowed for stereospecific ligation with different types of nucleophiles and proteins.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;centered electrophilic &#8216;warheads&#8217; have emerged as key components for chemical proteomic probes through sulfur&#8208;exchange chemistry (SuFEx) with protein nucleophiles. Among these functional groups, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs) stand out for their modifiable sites, tunable electrophilicities, and chiral sulfur&#8208;center, presenting exciting possibilities for new covalent chemical probes. However, the synthetic access to chiral SIFs has been a challenge, limiting their exploration and applications. In this study, we describe a convenient route to obtain chiral SIFs from readily available sulfenamides via a series of one&#8208;pot tandem reactions with high enantiomeric excess (ees). The resulting chiral SIFs were further converted into a diverse array of chiral S(VI) derivatives under mild conditions or in buffer solutions. Most significantly, the specificity of the chiral SIFs in protein ligation experiments underscored the critical role of sulfur&#8208;center chirality in the design and screening of more&#8208;selective covalent probes and therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;One-pot procedural for convenient preparation of chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs). The rational screening of Cl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as oxidation reagent allows for the enantioselective and stereospecific conversion of S(II) into chiral S(VI). The critical step includes a enantioselective hydrolysis reaction. The obtained SIFs allowed for stereospecific ligation with different types of nucleophiles and proteins.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Monocyclic Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the low electron transition energies typical of thiocarbonyl compounds, mini phosphors were designed by attaching auxiliary electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on thione cores. Purely organic, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 750&#8197;nm was obtained with a luminophore weighing only 162&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which was synthesized starting from a natural product.







Abstract
Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750&#8197;nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (403&#8197;nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.

         <title>Evolution of Frustrated Coordination in Eutectic Electrolyte Driven by Ligand Asymmetry toward High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large coordination frustration driven by molecular asymmetry of ligands and disordered cation&#8208;ligand&#8208;anion&#8208;water eutectic coordination can lead to relatively enhanced chemical stability, weak coordination strength and promoted mass mobility in eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes hold promise for aqueous zinc metal batteries in sustainable energy storage chemistries, yet improvement from perspective of molecule configurational engineering are ambiguous. Herein, we propose design strategy of increasing asymmetric molecular geometry in organic ligands to regulate frustrated coordination and disordered structure for eutectic electrolytes toward enhanced zinc metal batteries. The introduced asymmetry in eutectic component gives rise to relatively weak coordination strength and configurational disorder interaction among cation&#8208;anion&#8208;ligand, leading to suppressed local aggregation, steady eutectic phase and improved Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Such highly frustrated coordination state also enables disruption of hydrogen bonding network and reinforcement of anion participation, which results in confined side reactions, decreased water activity and the formation of inorganic&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase. In comparison to highly symmetric ligands, asymmetric ligand&#8208;involved eutectic electrolytes with configurational disorder deliver high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;%, stabilized Zn plating/stripping of 5000&#8197;h and impressive rate capability even under harsh conditions such as small N/P, low temperature. The rationale in this work advances the deep understanding of asymmetric molecular engineering in eutectic electrolytes and showcases suitability of frustrated coordination to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Pt nanoparticles (NP) without oxidic overlayer on rutile (Ptex/R) and the encapsulated Pt NP on rutile (Pten/R) were synthesized based on the difference of support properties. Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction (SMSI) was modulated on rutile supported Pt NP over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It was found that oxygen vacancy (Ov) defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by modulating the metal&#8208;support interaction. Through a combination of DFT calculations, it is found that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile was reduced by Ov on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species, which hinders the adsorption of Pt NP on the oxidic overlayer and prevents the formation of SMSI.







Abstract
The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 molCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gM&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8&#8201;%) at 800&#8201;&#176;C over 100&#8197;h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO2 hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Locking and Sulfur&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Constructing Deep&#8208;Red Organic Electroluminescent Emitter with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on carbon locking and sulfur embedding has been used to construct a high&#8208;performance red multiple resonance (MR) emitter. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on the target molecule exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67,0.33) and a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, the lack of construction strategies for purely red MR&#8208;TADF materials significantly impedes their application in full&#8208;color high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking and sulfur&#8208;embedding strategy to modify the parent MR&#8208;TADF framework, resulting in a red MR&#8208;TADF emitter with high color purity. The reported MR&#8208;TADF molecule (namely, FSBN) demonstrates a pure red emission with an emission maximum of 621&#8197;nm in toluene solution. The OLED with FSBN as emitter exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), which exactly matches the red standard defined by the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC). Importantly, the single&#8208;host OLED achieves a high power efficiency (PE) of up to 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, suggesting the potential for the development of low power consumption red OLEDs.

         <title>Controllable Heavy n&#8211;type Behaviours in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Non&#8208;Conjugated Passivants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed heavy n&#8208;type doped perovskite by precisely controlling the electron&#8208;deficient ability of piperazinium iodide derivatives. The CCPI&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a champion efficiency of 25.74&#8201;% and maintained 88&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,200&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Interfacial issues between the perovskite film and electron transport layer greatly limit the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite organic ammonium passivants have been widely established as interfacial layers, they failed to improve electron extraction. Here, we reported that the heavy n&#8208;type characteristics in a low band gap perovskite film could be modulated by incorporating non&#8208;conjugated ammonium passivants with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities. This resulted in a significant enhancement of electron extraction in the heavily n&#8208;type doped perovskite. The passivant&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 25.74&#8201;% with an excellent fill factor of 85.4&#8201;% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.166&#8197;V, which are significantly higher than that of the control device. The unencapsulated devices maintained 88&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1,200&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline NiO for Industrial&#8208;Scale Electrocatalytic PET Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO with an amorphous&#8208;crystalline structure synthesized through ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature oxidation exhibits rapid reconstruction and enhanced active sites, which can reach an industrial current density of &gt;1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and generate a profit of $582 per ton of waste PET.







Abstract
The conversion of plastic waste into valuable chemicals through innovative and selective nano&#8208;catalysts offers significant economic benefits and positive environmental impacts. However, our current understanding of catalyst design capable of achieving industrial&#8208;grade current densities is limited. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;supported amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate and hydrogen fuel. The catalyst achieves an industrial current density of over 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, with an 80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a formate production rate of 7.16&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the rapid transformation of amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH at the amorphous&#8208;crystalline interface provides a thermodynamic advantage for formate desorption, leading to the high activity required for industrial applications, which is challenging to achieve for fully crystalline NiO. A techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates that recycling waste PET using this catalytic process could generate a profit of $582 per ton. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient approach to promoting the sustainable utilization of waste PET.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cycloheptadienones Starting from Phenols and Using a Rhodium/Boron Asymmetric Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal editing offers a unique route to assemble complex architectures from simple feedstocks that are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the asymmetric version of skeletal editing has not been widely studied. Herein, we present a modular rhodium/boron asymmetric catalytic system that enables ring&#8208;expansion of phenols with cyclopropenes to synthesize highly functionalized cycloheptadienones in excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. This unique protocol features with low&#8208;catalyst loading, atom and step&#8208;economies, and mild neutral reaction conditions. Isotope&#8208;labelling experiments and DFT calculations have been conducted to reveal that boron reagent plays a vital role in the whole catalytic cycle.

         <title>Electrostatic Confinement&#8208;Induced Excited Charge Transfer in Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Promoting CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced excited charge transfer pathway is demonstrated in supramolecular photosystem composing of an ionic covalent organic framework and cationic metal complexes. The electrostatic confinement enables an attraction of metal cations to COF to effectively accept photogenerated electrons, while maintaining their homogeneous catalytic properties, achieving an enhancement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allow for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Barium Promoter Enormously Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor during the ammonia decomposition. The optimized Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.







Abstract
As a well&#8208;established topic, single&#8208;atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single&#8208;atom form, the intrinsic roles of single&#8208;atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst achieves extremely high H2 production rate of 138.3 mmolH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 at very low temperature (500&#8201;&#176;C, GHSV=840,000&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 exhibits excellent durability during the 350&#8197;h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Both Y2O3 and Co demonstrate positive interactions with Ba, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Ba species at high temperatures (&#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C). Ba single atoms significantly enhance the charge density of Co and form additionally active Co&#8722;O&#8722;Ba&#8722;Y2O3 interfacial sites, which alleviates hydrogen poisoning and decreases the reaction barrier of the N&#8722;H bond activation of *NH. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a well-established topic, single-atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single-atom form, the intrinsic roles of single-atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8722;Ba/Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with crystallized BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co&#8722;Ba/Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves extremely high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 138.3 mmolH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at very low temperature (500&#8201;&#176;C, GHSV=840,000&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Co&#8722;Ba/Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent durability during the 350&#8197;h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non-noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru-based catalysts. Both Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Co demonstrate positive interactions with Ba, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Ba species at high temperatures (&#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C). Ba single atoms significantly enhance the charge density of Co and form additionally active Co&#8722;O&#8722;Ba&#8722;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfacial sites, which alleviates hydrogen poisoning and decreases the reaction barrier of the N&#8722;H bond activation of *NH. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Infusion Induced Reconstruction Enhances Multifunctional Thermally Conductive Films for Robust Low&#8208;Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient carbon infusion strategy for atoms reconstruction is proposed to optimize phase composition of electromagnetic (EM) materials. Enhanced abilities from abundant heterointerfaces and magnetic coupling, the FWC&#8208;O@C/ANFs composite film exhibited impressive performance in low&#8208;frequency EM absorption and thermal conductivity, where coefficient bandwidth surpasses the entire C&#8208;band and thermal conductivity beyond 2500% of the pure ANFs.







Abstract
Deterministic fabrication of highly thermally conductive composite film with satisfying low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic (EM) absorption performance exhibits great potential in advancing the application of 5G smart electric devices but persists challenge. Herein, a multifunctional flexible film combined with hetero&#8208;structured Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C (FWC&#8722;O@C) as the absorber and aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as the matrix was prepared. Driven by an atomic gradient infusion reduction strategy, the carbon atoms of absorbers can be precisely relocated from carbon shell to core oxometallate lattice, triggering in situ carbothermic reduction for customization of unique oxometallate&#8208;carbide heterojunctions and surface geometrical structure. Such an atoms reconstruction process effectively regulates interface electronic structure and magnetic configuration, resulting in enhanced polarization loss from abundant heterointerfaces and crystal defects and magnetic loss from hierarchical structure endowed magnetic coupling interaction, which jointly contributes to the efficient low&#8208;frequency EM absorption performance. Eventually, optimized FWC&#8722;O@C microplate exhibits a broad absorption bandwidth surpassed the entire C band, and the assembled FWC&#8722;O@C/ANFs composite film also performs a high thermal conductivity over 2500&#8201;% higher than that of the pure ANFs. These findings provide a new insight into the atomic reconstruction affected EM properties and a generalized methodological guidance for preparing multifunctional thermally conductive composite films.

         <title>Second Generation Zwitterionic Aza&#8208;Diarylethene: Photoreversible CN Bond Formation, Three&#8208;State Photoswitching, Thermal Energy Release, and Facile Photoinitiation of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes is presented, which allows reversible photocontrol over all three isomeric states via photoreversible CN bond formation and E/Z photoisomerization. The high energy of the metastable states can be stored for long time while quick release is enabled by solvent polarity changes. A significantly improved capability for photoinitiation of polymerization reactions is demonstrated for materials applications.







Abstract
Diarylethenes are a well&#8208;studied and optimized class of photoswitches with a wide range of applications, including data storage, smart materials, or photocontrolled catalysis and biological processes. Most recently, aza&#8208;diarylethenes have been developed in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond connections are replaced by carbon&#8208;nitrogen connections. This structural elaboration opens up an entire new structure and property space expanding the versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over all three switching states. High&#8208;yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic Z isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light. The third zwitterionic E isomeric state can be reached in up to 87&#8201;% upon irradiation with a third wavelength. Its high energy content of &gt;10&#8197;kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza&#8208;diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) applications. The third state also serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light&#8208;responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching. Further, irradiation of the zwitterionic states leads to highly efficient photopolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA), directly harnessing the unleashed chemical reactivity of our aza&#8208;diarylethene in a materials application.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for All&#8208;Carbon Rechargeable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries with Durable Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we identified that the diluent TTE can effectively weaken the interaction of Li+&#8208;SUL while increasing the interaction of Li+&#8208;FSI&#8722; on the anode surface, and the space&#8208;occupying diluent made an increase of FSI&#8722; proportion without change its density on the cathode surface, which facilitates the ion desolvation and formation of uniform and thin interfaces at both electrodes with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides. Such optimized interfaces can effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and improve electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based rechargeable dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) based on graphite anode&#8208;cathode combinations have received much attention due to their high resource abundance and low cost. Currently, the practical realization of the batteries is hindered by easy oxidation of the electrolyte at the cathode interface, and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Configuration of a &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte with a high concentration of Li salt is expected to stabilize the electrolyte chemistry versus both electrodes, yet inevitably reduces the mobility of the solvated working ions and increases the cost of the electrolyte. Herein, we propose to build a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte by adding hydrofluoroether as the diluent to reduce the salt content while improving the solvation structure, allowing more anions to enter the inner solvation sheath. The new electrolyte helps to form uniform and thin interfaces, with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides, on both electrodes, which effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and optimize electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface. Consequently, the DIBs with graphite as anode and cathode operate for 3000 cycles and retain a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.7&#8201;%, highlighting the importance of stable interfacial chemistry in boosting the electrochemical performance of DIBs.

         <title>Multidentate Chelating Ligands Enable High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) strongly adsorbs onto the zinc surface, facilitating the formation of dynamically regulated impoverished water interfaces at the inner Helmholtz plane and optimizing the nucleation of Zn2+. Additionally, EDTMPA also shows the ability to alter the solvation structure of Zn2+ by displacing the coordinated H2O molecules within the primary Zn2+ solvation shell. These properties enable EDTMPA to suppress side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction and &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; (Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) generation, and improve zinc deposition to prevent dendrite formation.







Abstract
Zinc bromine flow battery (ZBFB) is a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage. However, challenges specific to zinc anodes must be resolved, including zinc dendritic growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the occurrence of &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Traditional additives suppress side reactions and zinc dendrite formation by altering the solvation structure of Zn2+ and adsorbing onto the zinc surface through only a limited number of zincophilic sites, resulting in weak adsorption on zinc metal and potential inability to simultaneously optimize the solvation structure of zinc ions. Obviously, increasing the number of potential zincophilic sites in the additive can significantly enhance the interaction with zinc. Herein, we propose a strong chelate, ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) as the additive, which boasts six potent zincophilic sites, not only promotes the formation of the water&#8208;deficient inner Helmholtz plane but also plays a crucial role in restructuring the solvation environment of Zn2+. As a result, the zinc symmetric flow battery with EDTMPA exhibited exceptional coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% over 800 cycles, surpassing the previous studies by a significant margin. Furthermore, the assembled ZBFB has showcased a dendrite&#8208;free and enduring cycling over 400 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Furthermore, the assembled ZBFB has showcased a dendrite-free and enduring cycling over 400 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystal (ZMCs) based on succinonitrile were developed with ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels for ion conduction and single Zn2+ ion migration feature. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivities and high Zn2+ ion transference number of the solid electrolyte, the as&#8208;fabricated solid Zn battery exhibited high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability, wide temperature adaptability and fast charging ability.







Abstract
The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 3.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200&#8197;h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 70000&#8197;cycles (7&#8197;months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;35 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fast charging ability. The ZMC differs from SPEs in its structure for transporting Zn2+ ions, significantly improving solid&#8208;state ZIBs while maintaining safety, durability, and sustainability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition of diarylphosphines to 2H&#8208;azirines, facilitated by a chiral Mn(I) complex. This method not only provides access to novel class of derivatives of the aziridine core&#8212;a structural motif recognized for its antitumor and antibacterial properties&#8212;but also introduces a phosphine moiety alongside the generation of an NH moiety within a strained three&#8208;membered ring. The discovery of this new Mn(I) complex that both enables the reaction and induces stereoselectivity is pivotal, as it underscores the significant potential of this earth&#8208;abundant metal in advancing asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting High Order Magnetic Anisotropy for Advanced Magnetocaloric Refrigerants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new 3d&#8208;4f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M = Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln = Dy3+ or Y3+, py = pyridine and DOTA = tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8243;,N&#8244;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride&#8208;bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four&#8208;fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy3+ complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and ab initio calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonenzymatic Hydration of Phosphoenolpyruvate: General Conditions for Hydration in Protometabolism by Searching Across Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous reactions within metabolic pathways have been reported to occur nonenzymatically, supporting the hypothesis that life arose upon a primitive nonenzymatic precursor to metabolism. However, most of those studies reproduce individual transformations or segments of pathways without providing a common set of conditions for classes of reactions that span multiple pathways. In this study, we search across pathways for common nonenzymatic conditions for a recurring chemical transformation in metabolism: alkene hydration. The mild conditions that we identify (Fe oxides such as green rust) apply to all hydration reactions of the rTCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, including the hydration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 2&#8208;phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which had not previously been reported under nonenzymatic conditions. Mechanistic insights were obtained by&#160;studying analogous substrates and through anoxic and radical trapping experiments. Searching for nonenzymatic conditions across pathways provides a complementary strategy to triangulate conditions conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000 h at 30 &#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000 cycles, retention: 67%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin&#8208;derived guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds into methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols through oxidative ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation reactions catalyzed by novel fungal polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is presented. The formation of o&#8208;diphenols rather than reactive quinones can be steered by the addition of a reductant. These PPOs offer new methods to reduce the heterogeneity of G and S lignin&#8208;derived product mixtures.







Abstract
The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Oxidative (ortho&#8722;) demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs by a distinct reaction mechanism as compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a novel photocatalytic system for the synthesis of glycine directly from methanol and nitrate. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles show a high glycine photosynthesis rate under mild conditions. The success of this work provides a sustainable pathway for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste.







Abstract
Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we develop an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8722;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8722;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8208;Urey experiments.

Exchanging a sulfur atom against a methine group in a series of azaacene based diradicals furnishes non&#8208;Kekul&#233;, meta&#8208;quinodimethane based diradicals with singlet ground states and small singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Zwitterionic contributions are ruled out experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically, and the diradicals display huge two&#8208;photon cross sections in the infrared spectral region.







Abstract
Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; quinoidal azaacences m&#8208;A (1&#8201;a,b) were synthesized and compared to their para&#8208; and ortho&#8208;quinodimethane analogues. m&#8208;A display high diradical characters (1&#8201;b: y0 = 0.88) due to their meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) topology. Electron paramagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and supraquantum interference device measurements in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed singlet ground states for m&#8208;A with singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST (0.13&#8211;0.25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and thermally populated triplet states. These non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structures are over all void of zwitterionic character and possess record high two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small heterostructures (AuNCs@OFTF) with amphiphilicity were developed. They can be rapidly internalized in cyanobacteria and provide a programmable electronic interface, where the strong energetic coupling accelerates electron transfer in living cyanobacteria. Exogenous photogenerated electrons from AuNCs@OFTF enable a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent and enhance biomass production of cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNCs@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNCs@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNCs@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNCs@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNCs@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.

The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds&#8212;Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles via hydroborative cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds is reported. Structurally diverse products, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more were readily obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed an interesting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon, including &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles was studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.

         <title>Peptide Degrader&#8208;Based Targeting of METTL3/14 Improves Immunotherapy Response in Cutaneous Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study unveils METTL3&#8217;s oncogenic role in melanoma. RM3, a designed peptide inhibitor disrupting METTL3/14 complex, induces proteasomal degradation via STUB1. RM3 reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, RM3 elicits significantly enhanced tumor response in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.







Abstract
METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (s=&gt;100 in &gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.







Abstract
The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)&#8208;, C(4)&#8208; and C(5)&#8208;, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (s) typically &gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The application of this KR method to tertiary alcohols derived directly from a natural product (geraniol), alongside pharmaceutically relevant drug compounds (indomethacin, gemfibrozil and probenecid), with high efficiency (s &gt;100) is also described. The KR process is readily amenable to scale up using bench grade solvents and reagents, with effective resolution on a 50&#8197;g (0.22&#8197;mol) scale demonstrated. The key structural motif leading to excellent selectivity in this KR process has been probed through computation, with an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction from substrate to acylated catalyst observed within the favoured transition state. Similarly, the effect of C(5)&#8208;aryl substitution that leads to reduced experimental selectivity is probed, with a competitive &#960;&#8211;isothiouronium interaction identified as leading to reduced selectivity.

         <title>Simultaneously Strengthening and Toughening All&#8208;Natural Structural Materials via 3D Nanofiber Network Interfacial Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial interlocking structure is designed by introducing protonated chitosan (CS) at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose (BC). This interfacial structure provides enough physical contact sites for hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The obtained structural material shows better environmental friendliness and mechanical and thermal properties than engineering plastics.







Abstract
Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics.

&lt;p&gt;An interfacial interlocking structure is designed by introducing protonated chitosan (CS) at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose (BC). This interfacial structure provides enough physical contact sites for hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The obtained structural material shows better environmental friendliness and mechanical and thermal properties than engineering plastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding combining excellent mechanical and thermal properties, especially the balance of strength and toughness. Here, we report a 3D nanofiber network interfacial design strategy to strengthen and toughen all-natural structural materials simultaneously. The introduced protonated chitosan at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose forms the interfacial interlocking structure of nanonetworks, achieving a robust physical connection and providing enough physical contact sites for chemical crosslinking.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids, characterized by non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchors, are developed and used as hole&#8208;extraction layers in organic solar cells. Such simple and tailorable backbones offer a novel platform to study structural effect on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on ITO, which leads to an impressive performance of 19.66&#8201;% owing to optimized interfacial contact and active layer morphology.







Abstract
Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

A putative &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the functional characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>

The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoactive azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) shows an excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than its corresponding imine&#8208;linked 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), although only one atom is different in the two 2D COFs (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;). COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits much narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity, which is benefited from its azo linkages.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8722;N=N&#8722; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability with a superior energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 even under the harsh cycling conditions.







Abstract
Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability (2700&#8197;cycles) with exceptional anti&#8208;pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO4 cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200&#8197;cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01&#8201;% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive&#8208;capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on facile pathway for scalable production of durable thin Li metal anode toward reliable practicability.

         <title>Multifunctional Modification of the Buried Interface in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all&#8208;perovskite tandems.







Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.

&lt;p&gt;Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long-term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all-perovskite tandems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed tin-lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates is presented. By connecting the aromatic systems of the macrocycles via 5&#8208;membered rings under standard Scholl conditions, the formation of highly soluble and stable &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins is achieved. The described planarization led to significant alterations regarding the photophysical and optoelectronic characteristics of the molecules.







Abstract
A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.

         <title>S&#8722;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>

RuSx/NbS2 heterostructure was synthesized by the introducing of amorphous RuSx onto crystalline NbS2 surface. It shows a Pt&#8208;like HER activity with a low overpotential as 38&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is mainly benefit from hydrogen spillover caused by reversing charge transfer that induced by S&#8722;S bonds at RuSx/NbS2 heterointerface.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.







Abstract
Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmon&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmon hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9&#8201;%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>

A commercially available ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) was used to deposit palladium, demonstrating excellent performance in photocatalysis and thermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reactions under various pre&#8208;treatment conditions.







Abstract
Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250&#8201;&#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar): 7.46&#8197;molmethanol&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &gt;99&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.

         <title>The Fate of the Formic Acid Proton on the Anatase TiO2(101) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High vacuum FTIR experiments at temperatures as low as 13&#8197;K, together with divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that a short and strong hydrogen bond is formed during the adsorption of HCOOH on the anatase (101) TiO2 surface. Such unusual H&#8208;bond has previously escaped direct spectral detection because of a huge red shift of its vibrational frequency.







Abstract
As a prototype adsorption reaction of gas Br&#248;nsted acid on oxides, we study the adsorption of formic acid on anatase. We perform infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed HCOOH and HCOOD on TiO2 nanopowders, from 13&#8197;K up to room temperature in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum chamber. We assign the IR signals via computed spectra from nuclear quantum dynamics simulations using our divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics method. The acid proton forms an extraordinarily short and strong hydrogen bond with the surface oxygen. The strength of this hydrogen bond, that compares to H bonds in ice at high pressures, is at the root of a substantial redshift with respect to the typical free OH stretching frequency, which eludes its straightforward detection.

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydronium cation (H3O+) was found to be critical to regulating the observed behaviors of IrO2 during acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The H3O+ cation induced an internal electric field at the interface, enabling selective bond&#8208;tuning to the reaction intermediates. As a result, 0.5&#8197;monolayer of *OH species was stabilized under OER operational condition, and the overall conversion was revealed to be hindered by *OH&#8594;*O.







Abstract
The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O&#8594;*OOH to *OH&#8594;*O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergistic tuning of lattice magnetic fields and interfacial structure stability, this work provides a green, efficient, and universal strategy of Si gradient doping to overcome the kinetic hysteresis problems that have long&#8208;term hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.







Abstract
Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8722;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8722;xSi0.01O2, 0.6&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of UDP&#8208;Glycosyltransferases for Synthesizing Triterpenoid Glycosides with a Linear Trisaccharide as Aided by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferase UGT91H enzymes for the regioselective 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids to generate triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide are described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to expand the substrate scope of UGT91H enzymes, and an RTAS loop was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H enzymes.







Abstract
Triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The glycosylation of triterpenoids catalyzed by UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is a crucial method for producing valuable derivatives with enhanced functions. However, only a few UDP&#8208;glucosyltransferases have been reported to synthesize the rare triterpenoids with linear&#8208;chain trisaccharide at C3&#8722;OH. This study revealed that the UGT91H subfamily primarily contributed to the 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids with high regioselectivity, then the substrate scope was further expanded by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). With ancestral enzyme UGT91H_A1 as a model, the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function relationship was explored. A RTAS loop (R212/T213/A214/S215) was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H_A1. Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low&#8208;cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self&#8208;sufficient UDP&#8208;rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny&#8208;based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component vinylene&#8208;linked D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with reinforced intramolecular charge separation driving force was designed and prepared, achieving highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation efficiency and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The Cu&#8208;CTUs active sites can effectively adsorb and activate CO2 to further enhance photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Intramolecular charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1) by integrating benzyl cyanides linker with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) moieties, featuring with strong intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites. The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation is achieved. Consequently, UJN&#8208;1 exhibits an excellent CO formation rate of 114.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h without any co&#8208;catalysts or sacrificial reagents under visible light, outperforming those analogous MCOFs with imine&#8208;linked (UJN&#8208;2, 28.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and vinylene&#8208;linked COF without Cu&#8208;CTU active sites (UJN&#8208;3, 50.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), emphasizing the role of charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry in designing novel COFs&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>High Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protonation&#8208;modification strategy has been employed to modify imine&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs), significantly improving the electron delocalization capabilities of the imine bonds and constructing advanced memory devices. The obtained novel COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT@PTSA thin film&#8208;based rewritable memristors exhibit high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105) and unprecedented endurance (more than 1300 number of cycles).







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300&#8197;cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Imine-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random-access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures.

Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor-acceptor (D-A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance.

         <title>A Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Enhancing Interfacial Stability and Solution Phase Discharge in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on LiTFSI, acetamide and boric acid, improving the oxidation voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V, and enhancing the solution phase discharge mechanism by forming Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds with Li+ and O2&#8722;. The introduction of boric acid also promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, which induces Li+ uniform deposition. The Li&#8722;O2 battery with this DEE delivers ultrahigh discharge capacity, improved cycling performance and intrinsic safety.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs) have gained widespread recognition for their exceptional energy densities. However, a major challenge faced by LOBs is the lack of appropriate electrolytes that can effectively balance reactant transport, interfacial compatibility, and non&#8208;volatility. To address this issue, a novel supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) has been developed, based on synergistic interaction between Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds through a combination of lithium salt (LiTFSI), acetamide (Ace) and boric acid (BA). The incorporation of BA serves as an interface modification additive, acting as both Li&#8208;bonds acceptor and H&#8208;bonds donor/acceptor, thereby enhancing the redox stability of the electrolyte, facilitating a solution phase discharge process and improving compatibility with the Li anode. Our proposed DEE demonstrates a high oxidation voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 15225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance of 196&#8197;cycles in LOBs. Additionally, the intrinsic non&#8208;flammability and successful operation of a Li&#8722;O2 pouch cell indicate promising practical applications of this electrolyte. This research broadens the design possibilities for LOBs electrolytes and provides theoretical insights for future studies.

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces new insights into the heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth dynamics that directly influence the performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). It reveals that high&#8208;performance electrodes for LMAs, characterized by a high active lithium adsorption capacity and fast surface diffusion kinetics, can be defined as &#8242;supersaturated electrodes.







Abstract
The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to construct nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with accurately tailored biphasic interfaces. Using Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures as a model catalyst for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, this work establishes a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of the catalyst.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8211;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5&#8208;minute temporal resolution by using regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.







Abstract
The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a method for long-term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5-minute temporal resolution by using regeneration-based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long-term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration-based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label-free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration-based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long-term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long-term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure was constructed. The heterostructure provides dual&#8208;sites for carbon dioxide reduction and nitrate reduction reactions, and thus facilitate efficient C&#8722;N coupling toward urea formation. The obtained Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers greatly enhanced urea yield rate and Faradaic efficiency compared with individual Ag and CuNi(OH)2.







Abstract
The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C&#8722;N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1&#8201;%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual&#8208;site catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, considering their role on the interface.

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a &#8220;Suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL) approach that serves as a general and economical delivery method to address fundamental biological questions. We applied SBL to investigate the cellular behavior of synthetic Ubiquitin related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1) under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.

We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

         <title>Unlocking the Anion Effect on Steerable Production of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of THF/NaCl aq, which is attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. The anion promotes electron transfer through proximity effects and also induces a decrease in the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension, thereby increasing the HMF yield.







Abstract
Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3 (74.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;AlCl3 (60.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al2(SO4)3 (35.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al(NO3)3 (14.9&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodiophobic graphite can be converted to sodiophilic graphite intercalation compounds through solvated&#8208;sodium&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation mechanisms, thus facilitating dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal plating/stripping with enhanced Coulombic efficiencies. This finding propels the achievement of cost&#8208;effective and high capacity anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries with energy densities of above 250&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6&#8197;V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18&#8197;V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7&#8201;% over 550&#8197;cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C (10&#8197;min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotics against Drug&#8208;Resistant Pathogens Discovered via Host&#8208;Dependent Heterologous Expression of a Cloned Biosynthetic Gene Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambocidins are calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a unique peptide core that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Heterologous expression of their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in multiple hosts resulted in production of new metabolites. However, only one heterologous host was capable of supporting production of the ambocidins. The ambocidins bind lipid II at a site distinct from the target of vancomycin.







Abstract
Historically, small molecules biosynthesised by bacteria have been an excellent source for antibacterial drugs. Today, however, the rediscovery of known compounds is a significant hurdle to developing new antimicrobials. Here we use a genome mining and synthetic biology approach to discover the ambocidins: calcium&#8208;dependent lipodepsipeptides that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. By cloning a silent biosynthetic gene cluster (the amb cluster) from Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 2387 and integrating this into the chromosome of Streptomyces avermitilis we induce expression of ambocidin A and B: two new N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine&#8208;containing cyclic lipodepsipeptides active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using a panel of Streptomyces host strains, we show that the choice of heterologous host is critical for producing the biologically active compounds, and that inappropriate host choice leads to aberrant production inactive derivatives. We show that N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine is the product of a heme&#8208;dependent oxygenase and that it enhances biological activity. Ambocidin A inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to Lipid II at a different site than vancomycin. Furthermore, unlike daptomycin, ambocidin A retains potent antimicrobial activity in the presence of lung surfactant, giving it the potential to treat bacterial pneumonia. Our work expands the family of calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a new member exhibiting a distinct mechanism of action.

         <title>A High Capacity p&#8208;Type Organic Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a high&#8208;voltage p&#8208;type organic cathode material of DHTAT for application in aqueous zinc batteries, exhibiting a high capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO4&#8722; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V. Notably, after 5000&#8197;cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, DHTAT retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically L/D&#8208;glutamate&#8208;derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H&#8208;aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.







Abstract
A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties.

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetrically &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-glutamate-derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H-aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double-alkyl-chained &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate-PDI-linear-alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H-aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE-coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain-containing PDIs only form H-aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

This report establishes the redox activity of biOx (bi&#8208;oxazoline), biIm (bi&#8208;imidazoline), and pyIm (pyridine&#8208;imidazoline) ligands in stabilizing nickel radical complexes. Direct comparison of the redox potentials of bidentate N&#8208;ligands provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.







Abstract
Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>

         <dc:description>
Intermolecular Homo&#8208;couplings, but especially Cross&#8208;couplings are challenging! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo&#8208; and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.







Abstract
We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.

         <title>Molecular Design of Hole Transport Materials to Immobilize Ion Motion for Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA&#8208;SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent T80 lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.







Abstract
Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (T95=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene with organic azides yields stable CAAC&#8208;iminoborane adducts. Experimental and computational data confirm the involvement of a relatively long&#8208;lived terminal borylene&#8208;dinitrogen adduct (i.e. diazoborane), [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)] as a key intermediate in the reaction.







Abstract
While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.

&lt;p&gt;While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)-stabilized dicyanodiborene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC-imino(cyano)boranes (&lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt;). NMR-spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of &lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt; and a relatively long-lived intermediate (&lt;b&gt;Int&lt;/b&gt;), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of &lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt;. In the absence of excess azide, however, &lt;b&gt;Int&lt;/b&gt; decomposes to &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR-spectroscopic and high-resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that &lt;b&gt;Int&lt;/b&gt; is the terminal borylene end-on&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. The formation of the iminoboranes &lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt; from diborene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and RN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds via an azide-diborene Huisgen-type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro-[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding &lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt; and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. The latter then undergoes either N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, or a Staudinger-type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane &lt;b&gt;2-R&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroptosis Inducing Co(III) Polypyridine Sulfasalazine Complex for Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting ferroptosis provides a novel avenue to overcome the limitations of apoptotic anticancer treatments. The Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex described here acts as a potent ferroptosis inducer for anticancer therapy. This complex selectively accumulates in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species, initiating lipid peroxidation, depleting glutathione, inhibiting glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4, and ultimately driving ferroptosis.







Abstract
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of cancerous tumors in the last decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. To overcome the shortcomings of currently applied chemotherapeutic treatments, much research efforts have been devoted towards the development of ferroptosis inducing anticancer agents. Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death that is associated with high potential inside the clinics. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of a Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex as a ferroptosis inducer is reported. Upon entering the cancerous cells, the metal complex primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, triggering the production of hydroxy radicals and lipid peroxides, ultimately causing cell death by ferroptosis. The compound demonstrated to eradicate various monolayer cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroids. To the best of our knowledge this study reports on the first example of a Co(III) complex that is capable of inducing ferroptosis.

         <title>Anodic Commodity Polymer Recycling: The Merger of Iron&#8208;Electrocatalysis with Scalable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

An earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst enabled efficient electrochemical recycling of post&#8208;consumer polystyrene with molecular hydrogen as the sole by&#8208;product, highlighting its potential for a circular carbon economy with a scalable green hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants POS or NEG were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.







Abstract
Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with horizontal ionic transport channels (H&#8208;MXene) to withstand extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions, significantly outperforms that with vertical ionic transport channels (V&#8208;MXene) in ion selectivity and permeability, achieving a current density over three orders of magnitude higher without significant polarization, an osmotic power density of 9.47&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.

Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well&#8208;designed donor&#8208;acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox&#8208;active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi&#8208;electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;] trithiophene (BTT) as p&#8208;type and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) as n&#8208;type material (BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 275&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte) and outstanding rate capability (79&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte). In addition, the potential of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF electrode for prototype batteries has been demonstrated by full cells of dual&#8208;ion (FDIBs), which attain comparable electrochemical performances to the half cells. Moreover, mechanism studies combining ex situ characterization and theoratical calculations reveal the efficient dual&#8208;ion storage process and facile charge transfer of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF. This work not only expands the diversity of redox&#8208;active COFs but also provide concept of structure design for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity organic electrodes.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [18F][Gd(FL1)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative in vivo mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel&#8208;based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [18F][Gd(FL1)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling. It is designed to facilitate the one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons to chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.







Abstract
Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recycling, with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>

Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

In this Reply, additional data, control experiments, clarifications, and discussions are presented to justify our statements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Janus bifunctionality of Pd nanoparticles or atoms encapsulated in a Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework is reported by Magnus Rueping, Pedro Casta&#241;o et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409490). As illustrated in the cover picture, on one side the catalyst is active and selective in photo&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;couplings, and on the other side selective and stable in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular living polymers with strongly coupled, delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge&#8208;transfer excitations (CTE) were developed by Jianlei Han, Shigenori Fujikawa, and Nobuo Kimizuka in their Research Article (e202410431). Suitably designed, chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) show spontaneous transformation from kinetically formed nanoparticles into thermodynamically stable, luminescent helical and tubular nanostructures with enhanced chiroptical properties, fluorescence quantum yields, and living polymerization characteristics.

A novel hybrid PET/MRI probe integrating stable gadolinium chelate with radioactive fluorine&#8208;18 was designed for precision imaging of perfusion and excretion dynamics. In their Research Article (e202409520), Andr&#233; F. Martins, Miloslav Polasek et&#8197;al. demonstrate how merging quantitative PET signal with MRI contrast within a single molecule improves diagnostic capabilities. Employing sophisticated image analysis, this innovative probe can reveal hidden health issues, such as early stages of kidney dysfunction.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409526), the presence of hydronium cation (H3O+) introduces an internal electric field at the interface. It allows selective bond&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediates and formation of partial surface hydroxylation under the operational conditions, which actively catalyzed the OER.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis: &#916;&#916;G&#8800; versus Enantiomeric Excess</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the difference between enantiomeric excess (ee) and relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;) as modeling targets in asymmetric catalysis. Through data analysis and application of modern machine learning methods, we unveil the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our results offer critical insights into which target more accurately predicts enantioselectivity, providing a guide for future research in machine learning for catalysis.







Abstract
With the rise of machine learning (ML), the modeling of chemical systems has reached a new era and has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and predict chemical reactions. Here, we probe the historic dependence on utilizing enantiomeric excess (ee) as a target variable and discuss the benefits of using relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;), grounded firmly in transition&#8208;state theory, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists. This perspective is intended to discuss best practices that enhance modeling efforts especially for chemists with an experimental background in asymmetric catalysis that wish to explore modelling of their data. We outline the enhanced modeling performance using &#916;&#916;G&#8800;, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non&#8208;linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types. We evaluated the datasets using fingerprint&#8208;, descriptor&#8208;, and graph neural network&#8208;based models. Our results highlight the distinction in performance among varying model complexities with respect to the target representation, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists.

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high&#8208;quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.

         <title>Nanomole Scale Screening of Fluorescent RNA&#8208;Methyltransferase Probes Enables the Discovery of METTL1 Inhibitors</title>

A nanomole&#8208;scale modular synthesis approach enables the rapid development of fluorescent RNA MTase probes, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screenings for drug development. This innovative approach enables advancements in RNA MTase medicinal chemistry highlighted by the discovery of METTL1 inhibitors.







Abstract
RNA methylation is a metabolic process validated for its association with various diseases, and thus, RNA methyltransferases (MTases) have become increasingly important in drug discovery. Yet, most frequently utilized RNA MTase assays are limited in their throughput and hamper this rapidly evolving field of medicinal chemistry. In this study, we describe a modular nanomole scale building block system that allowed the identification of tailored fluorescent MTase probes to unlock a broad selection of MTase drug targets for fluorescence&#8208;based binding assays. Probe candidates were initially prepared on a 4 nanomole scale and could be tested directly from crude reaction mixtures to allow rapid probe identification and optimization. Using an alkyne&#8208;azide click late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy and in silico protein databank mining, we established a selection of fluorescent probes suitable for relevant drug targets from the METTL and NSUN families, as well as bacterial and viral MTases. Using this concept, a high&#8208;throughput screening on the unexplored drug target METTL1 discovered three hit compounds with micromolar potency providing a (1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;based starting point for METTL1 drug discovery.

         <title>An Atomic&#8208;Scale Explanation for The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>

Hads travels with the motion of a liquid metal surface, allowing it to reach dopant sites (In or Sn) where it reacts with CO2 to make formate with a low barrier (0.25&#8197;eV). Hads is not mobile on a solid surface, explaining why only liquid metals catalyse the reaction.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn have previously showcased &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid. Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2 does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26&#8197;eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47&#8197;eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2 reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a ternary cluster consisting of a polyoxometalate cluster sandwiched by two gold clusters protected by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes was synthesized through ligand exchange, whose atomically precise structures were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. These composite clusters demonstrate excellent catalytic capabilities for reducing H2O2 via the intercluster synergistic effects.







Abstract
Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster&#8212;a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteomics enabled the measurement of protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome, via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis to an ultra&#8208;high mass range Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based native proteomics agreed well with native mass photometry regarding the mass distribution of detected proteins.







Abstract
Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird's&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis through Microbial Ecosystem Engineering on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial ecosystem engineering enables efficient solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis over a biohybrid photocatalyst. The syntrophic coculture of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) with the electron transport specialist Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400) over carbon nitride produced a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst for the sunlight&#8208;driven methane synthesis from carbon dioxide.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in solar chemistry to drive sustainable chemical reactions.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature.

     alt="Enantio- and Regioconvergent Nickel-Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio- and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3-disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantio- and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;-/&#947;-regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3-disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel-mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon-containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;-chiral silane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Abiotic Foldamer Quaternary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hydrogen bond donors at precise locations at the periphery of a stable aromatic foldamer helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix tertiary fold led to its aggregation in chloroform to produce genuine discrete abiotic quaternary structures in which the tertiary folds are preserved. The quaternary structures were assigned to C3&#8208;symmetrical trimer corresponding to the initial design, and to an unexpected hydrated C2&#8208;symmetrical dimer.







Abstract
Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.

         <title>A DNA Polymerase Variant Senses the Epigenetic Marker 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Increased Misincorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase that distinguishes methylated from unmethylated DNA by increased misincorporation opposite 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) during DNA synthesis. By generating 5&#8197;mC&#8208;dependent mutation signatures in the PCR product, the enzyme is able to sense methylated sites and allows direct detection by reading elevated error rates at 5&#8197;mC positions after sequencing without prior conversion of the template DNA.







Abstract
Dysregulation of DNA methylation is associated with human disease, particularly cancer, and the assessment of aberrant methylation patterns holds great promise for clinical diagnostics. However, DNA polymerases do not effectively discriminate between processing 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) and unmethylated cytosine, resulting in the silencing of methylation information during amplification or sequencing. As a result, current detection methods require multi&#8208;step DNA conversion treatments or careful analysis of sequencing data to decipher individual 5&#8197;mC bases. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated 5&#8197;mC detection approach. Here, we describe the engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase variant derived from Thermus aquaticus with altered fidelity towards 5&#8197;mC. Using a screening&#8208;based evolutionary approach, we have identified a DNA polymerase that exhibits increased misincorporation towards 5&#8197;mC during DNA synthesis. This DNA polymerase generates mutation signatures at methylated CpG sites, allowing direct detection of 5&#8197;mC by reading an increased error rate after sequencing without prior treatment of the sample DNA.

         <title>Tricyanomethane or Dicyanoketenimine&#8212;Silylation makes the Difference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me3Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)3. Further silylation with [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3][B(C6F5)4] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe3)3]2+ stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)3]&#8722;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)3, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a pKa value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)3 is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo&#8208; and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me3Si]+ as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)3]&#8722; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)3, namely [Me3Si][C(CN)3], and in presence of two additional [Me3Si]+ cations even the dicationic species [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+ as stable [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)3, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)3]&#8722;, silylation of the [C(CN)3]&#8722; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long&#8208;sought dicyanoketenimine [Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Unusual (4+3) Annulation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Oxabicyclo[4.1.1]Octanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1.]octanes is demonstrated via the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinone methides with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The reaction proceeds with the simultaneous activation of p&#8208;QMs and BCBs by Lewis acid. Mechanistically, the reaction entails the activation of the ester enolate of BCB by the Lewis acid. This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.







Abstract
Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinonemethides (p&#8208;QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)3, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and p&#8208;QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6&#8208;addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to p&#8208;QMs followed by the C2&#8208;selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid-catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quinonemethides (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6-addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-QMs followed by the C2-selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>

Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a non&#8208;local metasurface to achieve vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between surface lattice resonance and the C=O stretching modes of both ethyl acetate and p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). Within this VSC system, we observed a 2.7&#8208;fold increase in the solvolysis reaction of PNPA compared to the bare reaction. This finding highlights the robustness of metasurfaces in catalyzing chemical reactions via VSC.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.

         <title>Complex Dance of Molecules in the Sky: Choreography of Intermolecular Structure and Dynamics in the Cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O Hetero Ternary Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

         <dc:description>
We report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with dihydrosilanes or primary silanes, which gives access to a variety of C&#8208;stereogenic and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in decent yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silacycles have exhibited significant potential for application in the fields of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Accordingly, the development of effective methods for synthesizing these compounds has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with hydrosilanes, that allows the rapid assembly of various enantioenriched carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions. Further stereospecific transformation of the Si&#8722;H bond on the chiral silicon center expands the diversity of these C&#8208; and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628 nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600 nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98 &#215; 10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8208;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8208;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8208;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8212;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5 mol%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in&#8208;situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Glycerol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters by Synergistic Photoinduced Pd/Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8208;99% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer and DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Biosensors for Pathogen&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective diagnostic platforms. Both non&#8208;catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), polydiacetylenes (PDAs), protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA&#8208;based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine)) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8211;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic iron(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nanocage Supported Asymmetrically Coordinated Nickle Single&#8208;Atom for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction in Membrane Electrode Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow carbon carrier design of the Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst can facilitate increased active site exposure and improved mass transfer, achieving industrial&#8208;level current density within the membrane electrode assembly. Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C achieved nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across the wide current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt;97&#8201;%) over the current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66&#177;0.2&#8197;V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br not only enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlight that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.

         <title>Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localised oxidative catalytic reactions triggered by cavitation bubbles confinement on copper oxide microstructured particles.We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates selective and localised acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, minimising the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes towards catalytic oxidative reactions.







Abstract
Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic pollutant probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.

     alt="Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles."/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localised oxidative catalytic reactions triggered by cavitation bubbles confinement on copper oxide microstructured particles.We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas-stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates selective and localised acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, minimising the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes towards catalytic oxidative reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas-stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic pollutant probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage&#160;Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective "breathing behaviour" due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8211;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272; = 1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressured&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0 &#8211; 1 kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa with a fast response time of 18.1 ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate a human somatosensory network analogous PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin using arrayed pressure sensing. These capabilities hold great promise for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in&#8208;situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells Using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER&#8208;luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2a and 2b, "framed" and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium 2a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8208;Rh(I) complex 2aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8208;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4a) or C&#8208;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2b C&#8208;H was found to reversibly activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect   VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000 covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100 endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of novel targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).</dc:description>

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly&#160;Td&#160;symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;hybridized Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8208;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02%, surpassing the 13.31% achieved with Me&#8208;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered O&#8208;Heterocycles through Cross&#8208;[4+4] Cycloaddition of Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered rings embedded in tetraphenylene derivatives and hetero&#8208;analogues exhibit unique properties and allow diverse applications. A conceptually viable and straightforward approach to these frameworks is [4+4] cycloaddition, which still remains elusive. In this study, we describe the stereoselective cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa&#8208;analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles were explored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expanded the inherently chiral library of medium&#8208;sized rings and also contributed to the advancement of asymmetric cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.</dc:description>

         <title>Declined Singlet&#160;but Constant Triplet&#160;Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap&#160;and high radiative constants&#160;are desired. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, which&#160;is at the expense of reducing radiative constants. Herein, we demonstrated a new singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation approach to construct TADF with high radiative constant, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted singlet&#160;but a constant triplet&#160;energy, and therefore reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that singlet&#160;state is delocalized while triplet&#160;state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is reduced from 0.60 eV, 0.46 eV to 0.25 eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 10^8/s) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (10^6 ~ 10^7/s). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Free Sulfate Groups in Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>General strategies for synthesizing sulfated oligosaccharides employ the protection of sulfate groups for glycosylation or post&#8208;sulfation after the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6&#8208;sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2&#8208;NTroc group or 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group using an ortho&#8208;hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;&#8208;glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2&#8208;NHTroc and 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6&#8208;position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxionium&#8208;cation via 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation. Additionally, glycosylation reactions under various counter cations of the sulfate group, such as Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+ and pyridinium were examined. Results showed that sodium and lithium salt donors yielded the products in good yield. These results were also supported by ab initio calculations. Practical glycosylation reactions between disaccharide donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with free sulfate groups successfully yielded the sulfated tetrasaccharides. This study also discusses how a sodium salt acts as a protecting group during glycosylation.</dc:description>

However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6-sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2-NTroc group or 2-O-acetyl group using an ortho-hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;-glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2-NHTroc and 2-O-acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6-position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxionium-cation via 2-O-acyl participation.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors.  However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8208;7.5 &#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8208;6.5 &#197; along &#960;&#8208;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8208;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19:1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron "reservoir" that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (9.8 times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95% after 6 h.</dc:description>

The compounds were characterized in solution and in the solid&#8208;state and their donor ligand properties in heterobimetallic complexes were investigated, whereby a series of tungsten carbonyl complexes was isolated. Furthermore, a new synthetic route towards a previously described lithium&#8208;aluminum heterobimetallic dimetallocene is reported, which also enabled the isolation of a heterobimetallic polydecker of lithium and gallium.</dc:description>

         <title>GlutaR: A&#160;High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity, and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed&#160;in situ&#160;titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of GS and GLS differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR&#8217;s ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice&#160;in vivo.&#160;These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter "RDC" to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super&#160;blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene, and the maximum selectivity for branched alkanes reported up to date is about 70%. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8208;C13) with yield of 73.3% over SO42&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280 &#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1% within the C4&#8208;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus via electronic effects of organic functional groups for enhanced hydrogen production activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP&#8217;s band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8208;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8208;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1 e&#8208; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80 V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3 e&#8208; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8208;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8208;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1 e&#8208;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1 e&#8208; to 3 e&#8208;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8208;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3 mmol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 35 and 8 times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8208;WOv with 0.077 min&#8208;1 of rate constant, 38 times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.</dc:description>

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Using a New&#160;Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy = 3&#8208;chloropyridine, X = BF4&#8208;, OTf&#8208;, NO3&#8208;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5 hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates are&#160; interesting candidates for supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in&#160;energy conversion or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine-tune the properties of the material. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates are&#160; interesting candidates for supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in&#160;energy conversion or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a polyoxometalate covalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene.

         <title>Paired&#160;Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emitting Copper(I) Indenediyltrisphosphine Complexes with Minimized Skeletal Vibrations and Configurational Disorder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials.&#160;Particularly for the red&#160;emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color.&#160;For example, the red color (lem&#160;=&#160;616&#8211;677 nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl backbone (ITP).&#160;Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of&#160;ITP&#8208;MX&#160;and&#160;the&#160;congeners, showcasing genuinely deep&#8208;red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56 nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader&#8208;emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds of PS. We show herein that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS susbstrates into benzoic acid (BAc) up to 40%, with small proportions of acetophenone and formic acid, under visible light (456 nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77% of the photons absorbed vs. 1% for the direct reaction with PS. These results suggest a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photocycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9% and 91.4% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.</dc:description>
