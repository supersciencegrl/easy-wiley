         <title>Fast and Durable Intraoperative Near&#8208;infrared Imaging of Ovarian Cancer Using Ultrabright Squaraine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The residual tumor after surgery is the most significant prognostic factor of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery is actively utilized for tumor localization and complete resection during surgery. However, currently available contrast&#8208;enhancing agents display low on&#8208;target binding, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, thus not ideal for clinical use. Here we report ultrabright and stable squaraine fluorophores with optimal pharmacokinetics by introducing an asymmetric molecular conformation and surface charges for rapid transporter&#8208;mediated cellular uptake. Among the tested, OCTL14 shows low serum binding and rapid distribution into cancer tissue  via  organic cation transporters (OCTs). Additionally, the charged squaraine fluorophores are retained in lysosomes, providing durable intraoperative imaging in a preclinical murine model of ovarian cancer up to 24 h post&#8208;injection. OCTL14 represents a significant departure from the current bioconjugation approach of using a non&#8208;targeted fluorophore and would provide surgeons with an indispensable tool to achieve optimal resection.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochromism of Nanographenes in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographene (NG) is a potential candidate for organic EC materials because of its large&#160;p&#160;conjugated system, chemical stability, absorption band covering the visible region, and tunable optical properties by postsynthetic modification. We show that NGs carrying redox active triphenylamine (TPA) units covalently linked to the NG edge function as EC materials in the NIR region. The hybrid materials can be obtained by the installation of TPA units onto the NG edge and display changes in the absorption spectrum in the NIR region extending to a wavelength of over 2000 nm upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction at low potentials (&lt; 1.1 V). Time&#8208;dependent unrestricted density functional theory calculation of a model NG at the UB3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d,p) level of theory suggests that a narrow energy gap between the basal plane and the oxidized TPA unit is responsible for the observed EC function in the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles&#160;as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide&#160;Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of nitrous oxide, N2O,&#160;via&#160;NH3&#160;oxidation is not in practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced&#160;via&#160;thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2&#8209;supported Au nanoparticles (2&#8209;3&#160;nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low&#8209;temperature NH3&#160;oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space&#8209;time yield than the state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art Mn&#8209;Bi/&#945;&#8209;Al2O3&#160;and remarkable stability over 70&#160;h on stream. The reaction proceeds&#160;via&#160;a Mars&#8209;Van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au&#948;+&#160;species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2&#160;identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3&#160;oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization as a green and selective oxidant.</dc:description>

X&#8208;ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results   indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of Ni site with short nickel&#8208;oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density   to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with near&#8208;optimal d&#8208;band center.  Here the Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV at 15 mA cm&#8208;2  and excellent stability with ~3% attenuation after 120 h cycle test.

         <title>Predicting solubility of ion pairs in aqueous inorganic chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from several to 100&#8217;s of &#229;ngstr&#246;ms, represent building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali countercations can inform and model natural and synthetic processes in aqueous media. In the study of POMs ([Nb  24  O  72  H  9  ]  15&#8722;  , Nb  24  ) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb  24  is most soluble with the smallest (Li  +  ) and largests (Rb/Cs  +  ) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K  +  . Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li  +  &gt; Na  +  &gt; K  +  &gt; Rb  +  &gt; Cs  +  ), and anomalous (Cs  +  &gt;Rb  +  &gt;K  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;Li  +  ). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility along with X&#8208;ray scattering and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies affirmed the accuracy of the desciptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8208;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti  6  Nb  14  O  54  ]  14&#8208;  , and provided guidlines to exploit alkali&#8208;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cy&#8208;cloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the  K  &#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its  1  H NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.</dc:description>

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance FA&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based perovskites have been considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower bandgap and better thermal stability compared to the conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. As the typical additives, amine molecules with different structures have been widely used in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematical review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influences of amine molecules on the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskite and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboranes are boron&#8208;carbon molecular clusters, possessing unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content and a delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications to supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents and organometallic coordination chemistry. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for oxidative carborane cage activation. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. Only in the recent few years, considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will play an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8211;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic encoded cyanopyridylalanines are presented as convenient and highly selective reactive groups for in vivo functionalization, cyclization and stapling of polypeptides. The non&#8208;toxic compounds can be genetically incorporated into proteins with high yields and their biocompatible reaction with amino&#8208;thiol moieties proceeds under physiological conditions to near completion without requiring a catalyst.







Abstract
Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of meta&#8208; and para&#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, ii)&#8197;in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and iii)&#8197;protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific in vivo protein modifications in complex biological environments.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO3 nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy.







Abstract
The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3&#8722;x (NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.

Ca&#8208;ion battery: Ascribed to the improved anion intercalation performance in the graphite cathode and reversible Ca2+ insertion in the organic anode, by combining a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated Ca&#8208;ion electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results for Ca&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <title>Binary Solvent Regulated Architecture of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Polarization for Highly&#8208;Selective Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with controlled open coplanar carboxyl oxygen atoms within the pores have been constructed through an adaptable binary solvent synthetic strategy. Activated HOFs with enhanced surface polarization show highly selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 based on differences of molecule polarizability.







Abstract
A binary solvent synthetic strategy is proposed for the construction of C2&#8208;symmetric molecule&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with permanent ultra&#8208;micropores and surface polarization derived from tunable coplanar open oxygen atoms. The activated HOFs BTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a and PTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a show highly selective separation of CO2/N2 with a record high ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity &gt;2000 under ambient temperature and pressure.

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing robust orthogonal and directional bonding lays the foundation for the construction of finite DNA origami superstructures with complex shapes. By employing a twelve&#8208;valence hexagonal prism DNA origami as the building block, versatile superstructures were obtained from different combinations of building blocks with appropriate valences. All of these superstructures are fully addressable and could guide the assembly of guest molecules to produce functional devices.







Abstract
Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it will facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Membrane Based on Pillararene&#8208;Intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a series of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanosheets based on pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene nanosheets is reported, which have larger lateral size compared with the original MXene nanosheets, in which a membrane was formed through vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The as&#8208;prepared membranes exhibited relatively high water permeance, rejection, and stability for treating water containing antibiotics under dead&#8208;end filtration and cross&#8208;flow filtration conditions.







Abstract
Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and threatens biological and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required. We prepared inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXene&#8211;pillararene nanosheets with a large lateral size (5&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36&#8197;nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Pore&#8208;Space Partition and Charge Distribution in Multi&#8208;Modular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge shifting via pore partition: A nine&#8208;nitrogen ligand simultaneously enables pore&#8208;space partition (via three N's) and charge reallocation (via six N's), thereby paving the way for multi&#8208;modular assembly of a huge family of tunable anionic porous materials with much enhanced chemical stability and selective gas and vapor sorption.







Abstract
We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic pacs materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni3&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt=1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C2H2 storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C3H8/C3H6 and C6H6/C6H12 mixtures.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through plasma&#8208;enabled post&#8208;treatment technology, a constant elastic collision with a large surface area generates periodic lattice vibration at a high potential difference, thereby rearranging the lattice along the electrically preferred direction. Nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor film is dramatically improved through the rearrangement of lattice, and thus the optoelectric properties of the materials are greatly enhanced.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films show better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.

         <title>Mapping Dual&#8208;Base&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Amidations: Application in the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides with 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones enabled the synthesis of sought&#8208;after 4&#8208;quinolones. The use of a new pre&#8208;catalyst supported by PAd2&#8208;DalPhos in combination with a DBU/NaTFA dual&#8208;base system, along with a thorough mechanistic investigation led to a successful demonstration of room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
The C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides with NH substrates employing nickel catalysts and organic amine bases represents an emergent strategy for the sustainable synthesis of (hetero)anilines. However, unlike protocols that rely on photoredox/electrochemical/reductant methods within NiI/III cycles, the reaction steps that comprise a putative Ni0/II C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling cycle for a thermally promoted catalyst system using organic amine base have not been elucidated. Here we disclose an efficient new nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides and 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones, for the first time where the (pseudo)halide is chloride or sulfonate, which makes use of the commercial bisphosphine ligand PAd2&#8208;DalPhos (L4) in combination with an organic amine base/halide scavenger, leading to 4&#8208;quinolones. Room&#8208;temperature stoichiometric experiments involving isolated Ni0, I, and II species support a Ni0/II pathway, where the combined action of DBU/NaTFA allows for room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rewriting of information stored on synthetic macromolecules is achieved via the introduction of an editable position tag. The automated read&#8208;out is facilitated by making use of an algorithm that is able to decode large portions of macromolecular information without interference from the operator.







Abstract
Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety via aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS1 spectra, analyze the corresponding MS2 spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound QAPyBF4 was used as perovskite modulator in the Research Article by Juin&#8208;Jei Liou, Taiho Park, Zong&#8208;Xiang Xu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117303). Experimental investigations showed that p&#8208;type conjugated cations [QAPy]2+ adsorb on the perovskite surface with under&#8208;coordinated Pb cations and highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; anions enriched at the SnO2 interface. This spontaneous diffusion effect of cation and anion improves the band alignment at two adjacent perovskite interfaces and reduces recombination losses.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Addition of Aryl Iodides across Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioenriched alcohols comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. Here, we first report that chiral nickel complexes can catalyze the intermolecular enantioselective addition of aryl iodides across aldehydes to provide diverse optically active secondary alcohols using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This method shows a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions and precludes the traditional strategy through the pregeneration of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ formed arylnickel, instead of an arylzinc, adds efficiently to aldehydes, forming a new C&#8722;C bond and a chiral nickel alkoxide that may be turned over by zinc powder.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first example of an intermolecular thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene coupling reaction is reported for the one&#8208;pot construction of C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bonds.

The progress was achieved by suppressing hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and associative reductant upconversion (via associative electron upconversion C&#8208;S three&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond formation) using an Eosin Y/DBU/MeOH photocatalytic system. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combining online ESI&#8208;UHRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling, determination of quantum yield and computational modeling revealed a unique photoredox cycle with four radical&#8208;involving stages.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Uranyl&#8208;Imprinted Nanocage for Selective Uranium Recovery from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adsorbent was fabricated by the in&#8197;situ construction of a uranyl&#8208;imprinted nanostructure in a MOF material. Impressively, the adsorbent shows highly selective uranium extraction ability in natural seawater, which was attributed to the fitting coordination structure for uranyl.







Abstract
An adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the in situ construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for the coordination between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO2(CO)3]4&#8722; in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, together with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.

         <title>A General Concurrent Template Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Nanoparticles with Controllable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermetallic nanomaterials with stoichiometrically atomic orderliness have extensive potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. However, the synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with precisely controlled macroscopic morphology and mesoscopic structure is still out&#8208;of&#8208;reach, limiting their practical applications to some extent. Here, we report a general concurrent template strategy for precise synthesis of mesoporous Pt&#8208;/Pd&#8208;based intermetallic nanoparticles with desired morphologies and ordered mesostructures, for the first time. The concurrent template not only supplies a mesoporous metal seed for heterogeneous nucleation of atomically ordered intermetallic phases but also provides a nanoconfinement mesoporous environment for nanocasting synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles with ordered mesostructure and rhombic dodecahedral morphology under elevated temperature. Using the selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic reaction, mesoporous intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles exhibited a remarkably controllable selectivity towards 3&#8208;nitrostyrene, 3&#8208;aminostyrene, and 3&#8208;aminoethylbenzene, respectively, depending on their atomically ordered intermetallic phases and confined crystalline mesoporosity. This work provides a very powerful strategy for the precise preparation of ordered mesoporous intermetallic nanocrystals for application in selective catalysis and fuel cell electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores harnessed by the pathways of photoinduced counterion migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;)  n  A  +  [X  &#8211;  ] (&#960; = &#8211;(C  6  H  4  )  x  &#8211;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harness of multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8208;acceptor arms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labelling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during bio&#8208;labelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of bio&#8208;labelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labelling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi&#8208;four component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets  in vitro  and  in vivo  via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye, can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8208;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interplay between Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Furan Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry for Sustainable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The furan Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition is a powerful green methodology to upgrade bio&#8208;derived resources into valuable, renewable chemical products. The intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics often complicates the understanding of this chemistry. In this review we provide simple structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships to guide future efforts in the design of efficient new synthesis routes based on furan DA reactions.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived furanic platform molecules have emerged as promising building blocks for renewable chemicals and functional materials. To this aim, the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition stands out as a versatile strategy to convert these renewable resources in highly atom&#8208;efficient ways. Despite nearly a century worth of examples of furan DA chemistry, clear structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships are still to be established. Detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in these very particular [4+2] cycloadditions is essential to push further development and truly expand the scope beyond the ubiquitous addend combinations of electron&#8208;rich furans and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Herein, we provide pertinent examples of DA chemistry, taken from various fields, to highlight trends, establish correlations and answer open questions in the field with the aim to support future efforts in the sustainable chemicals and materials production.

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zinc&#8208;AIEgen Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) with concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). MEPL parameters of the Zn&#8208;AIEgen hinged MOFs are far superior to some of the best multiphoton absorption (MPA) materials including the perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
A series of luminescent frameworks was synthesized from the selective combination of aggregation induced emission (AIE)&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) and Zn2+. Complex 1 was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes 2&#8211;5 were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligands. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) and concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). The multiphoton absorption (MPA) parameters of 1 are superior to other multiphoton emission materials including the perovskite nanocrystals. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MPA performance of the corresponding frameworks.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2  (btc = 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H  3  btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high quality Cu3btc2  films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2  films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Networks Enable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis**

         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonding network: Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of simple Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts in carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by stabilization of all transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High&#8208;Performance Diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer pair.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were synthesized by a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach by using Td symmetrical tetrahedral amidine hydrochloride and aldehyde. The 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and have moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%), and excellent thermal and chemical stability.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with a Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 shows high single&#8208;molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia-triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor-specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar-chart chip (V-Chip) for point-of-care analysis. The V-Chip signals of triple-negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow-up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control over Multicolor Molecular Emission by Temporal Chemical Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor molecular emission is controlled in a dynamic timing manner by introducing a temporal chemical lock. The temporal life&#8208;time of the systems can be encoded by molecularly engineering the structural information.







Abstract
Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.

         <title>Selective Fluorescence Imaging of Cancer Cells Based on ROS&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Cross&#8208;Linking of Artificial Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel with efficient atmospheric water harvesting is developed based on anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation AWH materials.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

     alt="Alkyl-GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible-Light Photocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkyl-GeMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible-light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single-electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl-Si(cat)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl-GeMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as radical precursors. Alkyl-GeMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Alkyl-Si(cat)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl-GeMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non-ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide phosphoramidites were developed for automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. The enzymatic cleavage of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 by cathepsin B is efficient in the context of single&#8208;stranded DNA, but is sterically hindered by double&#8208;stranded DNA and short hairpin loops. The design of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone allows the construction of oligonucleotide&#8211;drug conjugates which release their small&#8208;molecule payload after enzymatic cleavage.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications in vivo. Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8722;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8722;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90% yield. The host&#8208;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF property due to intense intermolecular change transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small single&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.014 eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70% was achieved and it represented the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8208;acceptor TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on the reversible uptake of carbon dioxide by dimetallynes featuring ancillary hemi&#8208;labile pincer ligands. Insertion into the Ge&#8211;Ge/Sn&#8211;Sn bonds yields species containing an E(CO  2  )E unit, with the mode of ligation of the CO  2  fragment determined crystallographically being found to be dependent on the identity of the group 14 element. The thermodynamics of CO  2  uptake/loss can be established through VT&#8208;NMR (&#916;H&#176; = +24.6(2.3) kJ mol  &#8208;1  , &#916;S&#176; = +64.9(3.8) J mol  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  , &#916;G&#176;  298  = +5.3(1.9) kJ mol  &#8208;1  for the loss of CO  2  in the Ge case), and the chemical consequences of reversibility demonstrated by thermodynamically&#8208;controlled exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via the betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fenton reactions have been recently applied in tumor catalytic therapy, whose efficacy suffers from the unsatisfactory reaction kinetics of Fe3+ to Fe2+ conversion. Here we introduce a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor catalytic therapy by using a two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet atomically dispersed with Fe species. The single&#8208;atom Fe species act as active sites for triggering Fenton reactions, while the abundant sulfur vacancies generated on the nanosheet favor electron capture by hydrogen peroxide for promoting hydroxyl radical production. Moreover, the 2D MoS2 support also acts as a co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the oxidation of active Mo4+ sites to Mo6+, thereby promoting the whole catalytic process. The 2D nanocatalyst exhibits a desirable catalytic performance, as well as a significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, which indicates the feasibility for applying such a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Construction of N&#8208;Heterocycles via 1,4&#8208;Palladium Shift&#8208;Mediated Double C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past years, Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation provided efficient and step&#8208;economical methods to synthesize carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via direct C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  3  ) bond formation. We report herein that 1,4&#8208;Pd shift allows access to N&#8208;heterocycles which are difficult to build via a direct reaction. It is shown that  o  &#8208;bromo&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylanilines undergo 1,4&#8208;Pd shift at the  N  &#8208;methyl group, followed by intramolecular trapping by C(sp  2  )&#8211;H or C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation at another nitrogen substituent and remote C&#8211;C bond formation to generate biologically relevant isoindolines and &#946;&#8208;lactams.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the past years, Pd  0  -catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation provided efficient and step-economical methods to synthesize carbo- and heterocycles via direct C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  3  ) bond formation. We report herein that 1,4-Pd shift allows access to N-heterocycles which are difficult to build via a direct reaction. It is shown that  o  -bromo-  N  -methylanilines undergo 1,4-Pd shift at the  N  -methyl group, followed by intramolecular trapping by C(sp  2  )&#8211;H or C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation at another nitrogen substituent and remote C&#8211;C bond formation to generate biologically relevant isoindolines and &#946;-lactams. The product selectivity is influenced by the employed ligand, with NHCs favoring the product of remote C&#8211;C coupling against products arising from direct C&#8211;C coupling and N-demethylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Efficient Carbon Resource Processing, Utilization, and Recycling towards Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient utilization and recycling of carbon resources, which contain mainly the elements C, H, and O, is an effective way to minimize CO2 emission. In this Minireview, green carbon science is discussed in combination with related fields, including petroleum refining and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials from coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics.







Abstract
Green carbon science is defined as the &#8220;study and optimization of the transformation of carbon&#8208;containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, CO2 fixation, and carbon recycling to utilize carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.[1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we propose the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progress in petroleum refining, and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics is highlighted in combination with green carbon science. An outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.

         <title>Master of Chaos and Order: Opposite Microstructures of PCL&#8208;co&#8208;PGA&#8208;co&#8208;PLA Accessible by a Single Catalyst**

Opposite microstructures accessible by a single catalyst: An iron guanidine complex produces defined block copolymers of lactide, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone and glycolide under solvent&#8208;free conditions at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Increasing the reaction temperature leads to enhanced transesterifications producing random&#8208;like copolymers. &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone was identified as crucial driver to obtain polymer chains with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions.







Abstract
One catalyst, two reaction set&#8208;ups, three monomers and unlimited macromolecular microstructural designs: The iron guanidine complex [FeCl2(TMG5NMe2asme)] (1) polymerizes lactide faster than the industrially used Sn(Oct)2 and shows high activity towards glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Its distinguished features enable the synthesis of both block and random&#8208;like copolymers in the melt by a simple change of the polymerization set&#8208;up. Sequential addition of monomers yields highly ordered block copolymers including the symmetrical PLA&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PLA pentablock copolymers, while polymerizations of monomer mixtures feature enhanced transesterifications and pave the way to di&#8208; and terpolymers with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions. A robust catalyst active under industrially applicable conditions and producing copolymers with desired microstructures is a major step towards biocompatible polymers with tailor&#8208;made properties as alternatives for traditional plastics on the way towards a sustainable, circular material flow.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots (MQD) or two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets (MN) were grafted on BiVO4  substrate, then as&#8208;assemblied MoOx  layer by combining ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as a promising model system of integrated photoanodes. As&#8208;prepared OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4  array not only achieves a current density of 5.85 mA cm&#8208;2  at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also remarkably enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing GLUT1 Targeted Pro&#8208;oxidant Ascorbate for Synergistic Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to realize effective photodynamic therapy (PDT), there is still a lack of therapeutic approaches concisely&#8208;structured to mitigate major obstacles of PDT in clinical applications. Herein, we report a molecular strategy exploiting ascorbate chemistry to enhance the efficacy of PDT in cancer cells overexpressing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). AA&#8208;EtNBS, a 5&#8208;O&#8208;substituted ascorbate&#8208;photosensitizer (PS) conjugate, undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting its uptake in GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed KM12C colon cancer cells and perturbing tumor redox homeostasis, respectively. Due to the peculiar pro&#8208;oxidant role of ascorbate in tumour environments, AA&#8208;EtNBS effectively sensitised KM12C cancer cells prior to PS&#8208;mediated superoxide radical generation under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. AA&#8208;EtNBS successfully exhibited GLUT1&#8208;targeted synergistic therapeutic efficacy during PDT both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study outlines a promising strategy employing ascorbate both as a targeting unit for GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and redox homeostasis destruction agent, thereby enhancing therapeutic responses towards anticancer treatment when used in conjunction with conventional PDT.</dc:description>

Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) offers new prospects for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. This Review discusses the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms, scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation.







Abstract
Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. Herein, the most recent contributions are reviewed, demonstrating exciting new opportunities, namely, the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.

         <title>Inter&#8208;relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium&#8208;based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter&#8208;relationship. This Minireview gathers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.







Abstract
The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers currently remains uncertain, as they rely on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on future directions of investigation is also given.

         <title>Silaborative Assembly of Allenamides and Alkynes: Highly Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Access to Bi&#8208; or Trimetallic Skipped Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereo&#8208; and regiocontrolled multicomponent approach to skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes decorated with one boryl and two silyl functionalities is described. This Pd&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical union of allenamides, alkynes, and Me  2  PhSiBpin (or Et  3  SiBpin) proceeds without the use of phosphine ligands, instead relying on chelation through the internal amide group of the allenamide sulfonyl. A variety of alkynes, including those derived from complex bioactive molecules, can be efficiently coupled with allenamides and Me  2  PhSiBpin in good yields and with excellent selectivity. The synthetic potential was demonstrated through multiple valuable chemoselective transformations, establishing new disconnections for functionalized dienes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the reaction first proceeded through borylation of the allenamide, followed by silylation of the alkyne and then reductive elimination, which convergently assemble the skipped 1,4&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;  Dt  &#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1) highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (  1  D  &#8208;UV); 2) automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H  2  O and D  2  O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3) a second dimension separation (  2  D  &#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90% using as little as a few micrograms of material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Kinetic and Fluorogenic Enhancement Strategy for Labeling of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of nucleic acids in living cells can be sterically hindered by tight packing of bioorthogonal functional groups in chromatin. To address this limitation, we report here a dual enhancement strategy for nucleic acid&#8208;templated reactions utilizing a fluorogenic intercalating agent capable of undergoing inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with DNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (VdU) or RNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;uridine (VU). Reversible high&#8208;affinity intercalation of a novel acridine&#8208;tetrazine conjugate &#8220;PINK&#8221; (Kd&#160;= 5&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;&#956;M) increases the reaction rate of tetrazine&#8208;alkene IEDDA on duplex DNA by 60,000&#8208;fold (590 M&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1) as compared to the non&#8208;templated reaction. At the same time, loss of tetrazine&#8208;acridine fluorescence quenching renders the reaction highly fluorogenic and detectable under no&#8208;wash conditions. This strategy enables live&#8208;cell dynamic imaging of acridine&#8208;modified nucleic acids in dividing cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversibly Photoswitching Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;sensitive Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging uses light excitation to generate the acoustic signal for detection and improves tissue penetration depth and spatial resolution in the clinically relevant depth of living subjects. However, strong background signals from blood and pigments have significantly compromised the sensitivity of PA imaging with exogenous contrast agents. Here we report a nanoparticle&#8208;based probe design that uses light to reversibly modulate the PA emission to enable photoacoustic photoswitching imaging (PAPSI) in living mice. Such a nanoprobe is built with upconverting nanocrystals and photoswitchable small molecules and can be switched on by NIR light through upconversion to UV energy. Reversibly photoswitching of the nanoprobe reliably removed strong tissue background, increased the contrast&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and thus improved imaging sensitivity. We have shown that PAPSI can image 0.05 nM of the nanoprobe in hemoglobin solution and 10  4  labeled cancer cells after implantation in living mice using a commercial PA imager.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Most of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack charge mobility, which is crucial for realizing their use in optoelectronic applications. This work proposes the design of MOF using triarylamine&#8208;based ligands (Zr&#8208;NBP) as the lone pair electron spacer to enhance the hole mobility in MOF while maintaining the luminescent properties. Zr&#8208;NBP has strong fluorescence with a good hole mobility of 1.05 x 10  &#8208;6  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is comparable to organic materials used in optoelectronic devices. We also employed a Zr&#8208;NBP nanofilm in the pure phase as both a non&#8208;doped emissive layer and a hole&#8208;transporting layer of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In particular, the obtained OLED device produced a bright green light with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.9 V. This work represents an advance in developing electronic properties of MOF from the chemical properties of its building blocks and would inspire the further design of MOF materials as active layers in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with ~ 51 % yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8217;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8217;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Crystallization of Zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 with Polyamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring processes of nucleation and growth to achieve desired material properties is a pervasive challenge in synthetic crystallization. In systems where crystals form via nonclassical pathways, engineering materials often requires the controlled assembly and structural evolution of colloidal precursors. In this study, we examine zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization and show that several polyquaternary amines function as efficient accelerants of nucleation, and, in select cases, tune crystal size by orders of magnitude. Among the additives tested, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was found to have the most pronounced impact on the kinetics of SSZ&#8208;13 formation, leading to a 4&#8208;fold reduction in crystallization time. Our findings also reveal that enhanced nucleation occurs at an optimal PDDA concentration where a combination of light scattering techniques demonstrate these conditions lead to polymer&#8208;induced aggregation of amorphous precursors and the promotion of (alumino)silicate precipitation from growth solution. Here, we show that relatively low concentrations of polymer additives can be used in unique ways to dramatically enhance SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization rates, thereby improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS Fibers as Multifunctional Microelectrodes for In Vivo Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vivo  microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast  heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities  , and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and  electrophysiological  recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes  mechanically match with neural tissues  , exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given  the multifunctionality  , flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes  offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.</dc:description>

Multifunctional microrobots, made of Ni@Pt microrockets, CdS quantum dots, and a host &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin selector, have been engineered that simultaneously exhibit i) self&#8208;propulsion, ii)&#8197;fluorescence, and iii)&#8197;magnetic properties in combination with iv) supramolecular chiral recognition for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; approaches. As a model chiral target, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated using a bimodal (optical and electrical) readout.







Abstract
Herein, a general procedure for the synthesis of multifunctional MRs, which simultaneously exhibit i) chiral, ii)&#8197;magnetic, and iii)&#8197;fluorescent properties in combination with iv) self&#8208;propulsion, is reported. Self&#8208;propelled Ni@Pt superparamagnetic microrockets have been functionalized with fluorescent CdS quantum dots carrying a chiral host biomolecule as &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; chiral recognition potential of MRs has been interrogated by taking advantage of the &#946;&#8208;CD affinity to supramolecularly accommodate different chiral biomolecules (i.e., amino acids). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated with a dual&#8208;mode (optical and electrochemical) readout. This approach paves the way to devise intelligent cargo micromachines with &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral supramolecular recognition capabilities to elucidate the concept of &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221;, which might be facilely customized by tailoring the supramolecular host&#8211;guest encapsulation.

         <title>Fold&#8208;in Synthesis of a Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene, the largest hetero[n]circulene, has been synthesized by a fold&#8208;in approach, as reported by Takayuki Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116789). The molecule exhibits a saddle&#8208;distorted structure in the solid&#8208;state, reminiscent of a camel back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star&#8208;shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

         <title>Gating Effects for Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown ether&#8208;functionalized 3D COFs can efficiently gate ion transport with an excellent gating ratio up to 23.6 are reported, which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far.







Abstract
The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt;2&#8197;nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulation of the ion transport. By strategic attachment of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ions. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offers high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.

         <title>A Facile Potential Hold Method for Fostering an Inorganic Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile potential hold process fosters the growth of a more inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Owing to the various decomposition potentials of the Li&#8208;solvation structures, salt anion&#8208;derived SEI was preferentially established on the current collector while reducing the components from organic solvents.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Reactions by Resonant Acoustic Mixing**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enables mechanochemical organic synthesis that avoids milling or crushing media, as well as bulk solvents. The RAM methodology enables significant simplification and improvement of mechanochemical olefin metathesis, the first mechanochemical strategy for ene&#8208;yne metathesis, and permits the direct, 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutically active sulfonylureas, without any significant changes to reaction conditions or conversion.







Abstract
We demonstrate catalytic organic synthesis by Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM): a mechanochemical methodology that does not require bulk solvent or milling media. Using as model reactions ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis and copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamide&#8208;isocyanate coupling, RAM mechanosynthesis is shown to be faster, operationally simpler than conventional ball&#8208;milling, while also providing the first example of a mechanochemical strategy for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ene&#8208;yne metathesis. Reactions by RAM are readily and directly scaled&#8208;up without any significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30&#8197;grams.

         <title>Preparation of Primary and Secondary Dialkylmagnesiums by a Radical I/Mg&#8208;Exchange Reaction Using sBu2Mg in Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and secondary dialkylmagnesium reagents were prepared in toluene by the reaction of sBu2Mg with alkyl iodides (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;4&#8197;h). Stereoconvergent I/Mg&#8208;exchanges were observed for secondary cyclohexyl iodides leading after quenching reactions to products with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, including homo&#8208;aldol products. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical pathways for these exchanges.







Abstract
The treatment of primary or secondary alkyl iodides with sBu2Mg in toluene (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8211;4&#8197;h) provided dialkylmagnesiums that underwent various reactions with aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides or allylic bromides. 3&#8208;Substituted secondary cyclohexyl iodides led to all&#8208;cis&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylmagnesium reagents under these exchange conditions in a highly stereoconvergent manner. Enantiomerically enriched 3&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;substituted secondary alkyl iodides gave after an exchange reaction with sBu2Mg stereodefined dialkylmagnesiums that after quenching with various electrophiles furnished various 1,3&#8208;stereodefined products including homo&#8208;aldol products (99&#8201;% dr and 98&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies confirmed a radical pathway for these new iodine/magnesium&#8208;exchange reactions.

A dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66(SH)2, was found to show efficient conversion of N2 into NH3 under visible light. The revealed synergetic action of the photoelectron supported by the proton was analogous to that in molybdenum nitrogenase, however, with characteristic &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions inside the [Zr6O6] cluster, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of nitrogenase.







Abstract
This work reports the dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)2 as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N2 fixation process. The 15N2 and other control experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N2 to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, and EXAFS as well as first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N2 molecules into the [Zr6O6] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8211;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr6O6] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N2 fixation and open a new way to fix N2 under mild conditions.

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic liquid 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium nitrate (BmimNO3) was anchored into Cu, through which the atomic coordination and electronic properties of Cu can be optimized to facilitate C&#8722;C coupling. This electrocatalyst can reduce CO2 to C2H4 with high selectivity. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 77.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in KHCO3 aqueous solution using a H&#8208;type cell, much higher than that over pure Cu catalyst (31.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of an ionic liquid (IL) on a Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. In a water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3&#8201;% was achieved at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that an IL can modify the electronic structure of a Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, making it more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.

Click On! &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of cationic cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) moieties is demonstrated to be a convenient, quantitative method for the click&#8208;like activation of aryl iodides as halogen bond donors. Photochemical demetalation using violet LEDs in MeCN returns the metal to its starting material form and supresses halogen bonding functionality. The cycle provides a reversible &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch for controlling the halogen bond donor strength of aryl iodides.







Abstract
&#951;6&#8208;Metalated aryl halides are recognized as a class of halogen bond (XB) donors. Click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;metalation/demetalation of aryl iodides by cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) ([CpRuII]+) is shown to turn ON/OFF (amplify/suppress) XB donor functionality. [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6] is shown to react quantitatively with iodobenzenes (ArIn, n=1,2) to yield [CpRu(&#951;6&#8208;ArIn)][PF6] compounds. Photochemical demetalation (405&#8197;nm) quantitatively reverts these compounds to ArIn and [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6]. Crystal structures of [CpRu(ArXn)]+ salts show that the [CpRu(ArIn)]+ cations are strong, charge&#8208;assisted XB donors analogous to iodopyridinium cations. XB&#8208;induced association of [CpRu(C6H5I)]+ with diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is established by NMR spectroscopy. [CpRu(C6H5I)][BPh4] and [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4] co&#8208;crystallize with DABCO and the structure of [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4]&#8901;DABCO&#8901;Et2O is reported. DFT calculations support amplification of the XBing capabilities of aryl iodides upon [CpRu]+&#8208;metalation.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly regulated networks of living systems, two antibody&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based devices are proposed that enable communication between two otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody&#8208;responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control protein&#8211;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene mediated by conformational switching can be tuned via controllable experimental conditions, leaving behind different largely ordered structures. Such method provides a new alternative and convenient method to influence the self&#8208;assembled structure of NHC&#8208;metal monolayers, a still missing but essential tool towards catalytic applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;The reversible self-assembly of an N-heterocyclic carbene mediated by conformational switching can be tuned via controllable experimental conditions, leaving behind different largely ordered structures. Such method provides a new alternative and convenient method to influence the self-assembled structure of NHC-metal monolayers, a still missing but essential tool towards catalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close-packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring-flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self-assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC-surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self-assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;Rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a cholesterol dimer&#8208;inward rectifier (Kir) channel complex using solid&#8208;state NMR and simulated annealing calculations is solved. The identified cholesterol binding pocket is directly linked to the mechanism of cholesterol&#8208;mediated inactivation of Kir channels. This work is one of the most detailed structural&#8208;functional studies of cholesterol dimer&#8208;protein interactions within a biological membrane.







Abstract
Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K+ efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K+ conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an &#945;&#8211;&#945; cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Indolenine and Indoline Ring Systems by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes was developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. A stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement was achieved to afford diverse indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their synthesis, stereoselective and regio&#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the migrating group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system for the cell&#8208;free production and screening of antimicrobial peptides for their membrane specificity is introduced. On the device, the peptides are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The droplets can be analyzed via fluorescence microscopy of flow cytometry.







Abstract
The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cell&#8208;free production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of co&#8208;encapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.

         <dc:description>Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3 hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8208;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface.

         <dc:description>Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades.&#160;&#160;Herein we report that the enzyme FtpM from&#160;  Aspergillus fumigatus  &#160;can methylate a broad range of aromatic mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids in good to excellent conversions.&#160;&#160;The enzyme shows high regioselectivity on its natural substrate fumaryl&#8208;  L  &#8208;tyrosine,&#160;  trans  ,&#160;  trans  &#8208;muconic acid and a number of the dicarboxylic acids tested.&#160;&#160;Dicarboxylic acids are generally better substrates than monocarboxylic acids, although some substituents are able to compensate for the absence of a second acid group.&#160;&#160;For dicarboxylic acids, the second methylation shows strong pH dependency with an optimum at pH 5.5&#8208;6.&#160;&#160;Potential for application in industrial biotechnology was demonstrated in a cascade for the production of a bioplastics precursor (FDME) from bioderived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).</dc:description>

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at ~680 nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800 nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of far&#8208;red by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rational approach towards precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs), end&#8208;capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described. PLLA chains crystallize into diamond&#8208;shaped platelets in isopropanol, which forces the terminal dyes to assemble into 2D array on the platelet surface by either dipolar interactions or &#960;&#8208;stacking and exhibit tunable emission. Dipolar dyes play a critical role in imparting colloidal stability and structural uniformity to the 2D crystals, which is partly compromised for hydrophobic ones. Co&#8208;crystallization between NMI&#8208; and PY&#8208;labeled PLLAs yields similar diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets with highly efficient (~80%) F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface. Further, &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA method confers enlarged, segmented block co&#8208;platelets using one of the homopolymers as &#8220;seed&#8221; and the other as &#8220;unimer&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses the Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical in achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat ~0.4 W/mK at 300 K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic &#12296;100&#12297; direction by about ~0.2 &#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained within density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitate the design of next generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new assay to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of inhibitors to &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation, are used as an example to exhibit the chemical PTM methods. After thiazolidinethione (TZ) was modified on POM, the POM derivatives (POMD&#8208;TZ) became a chemical PTM agent and could site&#8208;selectively covalent modify on A&#946; at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitized&#8221; probe. Our work provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation by using PTM agents for site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;robust Xanthine&#8208;Sodium Complexes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely&#8208;accepted theory is that life originated from the hydrothermal environment in the primordial ocean. Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super&#8208;robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;defined xanthine&#8208;Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430 K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at ~720 K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine&#8208;Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.</dc:description>

Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen-bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super-robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well-defined xanthine-Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430 K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at ~720 K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high-temperature, Na-rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine-Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;defensive Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in the photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report a light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anions (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyoligosaccharides Enabled by Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8208;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2 min in a high quantum yield (&#966; = 28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Doping Chemistry for Nickel&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries.   Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the mechanism underneath remains unclear.  We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows much lower diffusion barrier than B(III). In case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of B(III) is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record&#160;CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provide a source of energy and help offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH  4  /N  2  mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named  Ni(ina)  2  ,  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  ,  Ni(2&#8208;ain)  2  , and  Ni(pba)  2  , (where  ina  = isonicotinic acid,  3&#8208;ain  = 3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid,  2&#8208;ain  = 2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and  pba  = 4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them,  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can effectively separate CH  4  from N  2  with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (~0.6 and 0.5 nm) and pore environment. Explicitly,  Ni(ina)  2  exhibits the highest ever reported CH  4  /N  2  selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH  4  uptake (40.8 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  ) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH  4  /N  2  separation performance of  Ni(ina)  2  is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH  4  /N  2  ratios,  Ni(ina)  2  selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH  4  (99%). Theoretical calculations and CH  4  &#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism.  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH  4  molecules. Importantly,  Ni(ina)  2  has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH  4  from coal&#8208;bed methane.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversible Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T&#8197;Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications including cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. To curb these drawbacks, Jianfeng Zhou, Wenshe&#8197;Ray Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109550) reported a chemogenetic switch that can be reversibly turned on and off to control the expression of CAR using a clinical approved small&#8208;molecule drug, asunaprevir.

&lt;p&gt;The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications including cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. To curb these drawbacks, Jianfeng Zhou, Wenshe&#8197;Ray Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202109550"&gt;10.1002/anie.202109550&lt;/a&gt;) reported a chemogenetic switch that can be reversibly turned on and off to control the expression of CAR using a clinical approved small-molecule drug, asunaprevir. This novel technique will potentially enable delicate modulation of CAR-T activation during cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
We present evidence that the dual emission of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence in solution is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds 1&#8211;7 have been reported to exhibit unique dual emission, consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in solution. This finding triggered intensive research of RTP in &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron derivatives. Herein, we show clear evidence that the associated dual emission, especially RTP, is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT antitumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, on CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights draw a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2 equiv.) in THF at &#8208;30 &#186;C leads to a silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si(0)=Si(0) double bond with a significant &#960;&#8722;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si(0) atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low valent silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity from chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (g  abs  ) values of liquid crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10 times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (g  lum  ) up to &#8208;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical property. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (~1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;mediated protein shuttling between coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of protein uptake and secretion is crucial for (inter)cellular signaling. Mimicking these molecular events is essential when engineering synthetic cellular systems. A first step towards achieving this goal is obtaining control over the uptake and release of proteins from synthetic cells in response to an external trigger. Herein, we have developed an artificial cell that sequesters and releases proteinaceous cargo upon addition of a coded chemical signal: single&#8208;stranded DNA oligos (ssDNA) were employed to independently control the localization of a set of three different ssDNA&#8208;modified proteins. The molecular coded signal allows for multiple iterations of triggered uptake and release, regulation of the amount and rate of protein release and the sequential release of the three different proteins. This signaling concept was furthermore used to directionally transfer a protein between two artificial cell populations, providing novel directions for engineering lifelike communication pathways inside higher order (proto)cellular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;hosted enzymes for continuous flow catalysis in aqueous and organic solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires a stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a continuous MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased by 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8208;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for a time and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;V Ch . Its structure reveals the typical CODH&#8208;scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;V Ch  catalyzes neither CO&#8208;oxidation, nor CO2&#8208;reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;V Ch  undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;V Ch , oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Unconventional SAM Analogues To Build Cell&#8208;Potent Bisubstrate Inhibitors for Nicotinamide N&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide N&#8208;methyltransferase (NNMT) methylates nicotinamide and has been associated with various diseases. Herein, we report the first cell&#8208;potent NNMT bisubstrate inhibitor II399, demonstrating a Ki of 5.9 nM in a biochemical assay and a cellular IC50value of 1.9&#181;M. The inhibition mechanism and cocrystal structure confirmed II399 engages both the substrate and cofactor binding pockets. Computational modeling and binding data reveal a balancing act between enthalpic and entropic components that lead to II399&#8217;s low nM binding affinity. Notably, II399 is 1,000&#8208;fold more selective for NNMT than closely related methyltransferases. We expect that II399would serve as a valuable probe to elucidate NNMT biology. Furthermore, this strategy provides the first case of introducing unconventional SAM mimics, which can be adopted to develop cell&#8208;potent inhibitors for other SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases.</dc:description>

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8211;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co&#8208;exist on Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist.

&lt;p&gt;Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co-exist on Pd-PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd-PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd-PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one-step approach. These Pd-PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co-exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd-PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd-PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;excimer&#8221;, a contraction of an excited dimer, is the most classical photoproduct in organic materials. In this work, vibrational snapshots showing ultrafast structural dynamics triggering the excimer formation and its relaxation are presented based on ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that interchromophore vibrational modes are related to perturbing the excited&#8208;state potential surface of a dimer stack.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Aminophosphinites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites with esters of hydroxylamines is achieved by means of the dynamic kinetic transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines. A two&#8208;electron redox process is proposed for this reaction based on mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivity by using a copper(I)&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst. Based on several control experiments and 31P&#8197;NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative P&#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H2O2 is transformed to a chiral diarylphosphinate in high yield with retained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one dyad additive combining phosphonate and phosphine oxide groups for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is demonstrated. Owing to its dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% is obtained.







Abstract
Additives play a critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8211;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate the carrier radiative recombination in the electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1&#8201;%, 100.5&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 98.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#8801;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen&#8208;assisted copper&#8208;promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (CuII/CuI), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.







Abstract
C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for the functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF methods, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen&#8208;assisted reaction for the formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that under all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operative, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is a CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer from the carbon center of the nitrile moiety. Our study reveals that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.

Abstract
The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#8201;&#176;C), diverse metal&#8208;free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &gt;99&#8201;% alternating degree. The obtained polyesters possess high oxygen content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;7), molecular weights of 2.0&#8211;33.3&#8197;kDa, narrow polydispersities of 1.2&#8211;1.5, low glass transition temperatures (&#8722;64 to &#8722;27&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high decomposition temperatures (275 to 324&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Helicity Modulation in NIR&#8208;Absorbing Porphyrin&#8211;Ryleneimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., Cd  II  or Hg  II  , the resulting complexes switch to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the switching is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(  tert  &#8208;butyl)phenyl groups switch to their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Polyoxometalates: Selective Polyanion Binding and Ultrahigh Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational development of anion templation strategy in the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8211; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1:1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: (1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; (2) a HfCl  4  mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;  tert  &#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; (3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and (4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The usage of elemental sulfur (S  8  ) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabricating high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S  8  hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S  8  to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S  8  , with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF  6  ([PPN]  +  is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;nitrogen Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations have been accomplished. It is shown that the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents are the determining factors governing the N&#8722;F bond lengths which decrease from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The crystal structures of [NH3F]+[CF3SO3]&#8722;, [NH2F2]+[SbF6]&#8722;, and [N2F3]+[Sb3F16]&#8722; have been determined, representing the first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations. The influences of the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents on the N&#8722;F bond lengths are evaluated for the series N2F+, N2F3+, NF2O+, NH3F+, NH2F2+, and NF4+. It is shown that the N&#8722;F bond length decreases from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8722;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems

It is shown that the N&#8722;F bond length decreases from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s-character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8722;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N to Give Colloidal Quantum Dots: Towards Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of colloidal carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;like quantum dots, C4NQDs, and their functional composites have been introduced. They show interesting fluorescence/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence dual&#8208;mode emission for advanced optical encryption. They also show edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalysis toward sulfur chemistry in Li&#8722;S cells by exploiting the functional group and edge effects of quantum dots.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C4N quantum dots (QDs) and their functional composites and explore their optical activities and edge&#8208;selective polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis. As&#8208;obtained C4NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C4NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li&#8722;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Coordinated Perovskite Solar Cell with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Exceeding 1.23&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Magnesium Vanadates as Potential Magnesium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials through an Ab&#8197;Initio Guided Carbothermal Reduction Approach**

Ab initio prediction of thermodynamic parameters leads to a predictive synthesis strategy utilizing solid carbon for facile preparation of a series of magnesium vanadate compounds. 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of these compounds is shown to be a practical way for characterizing their local Mg structures.







Abstract
Many technologically relevant materials for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxides that are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. Herein, we show that an ab&#8197;initio predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multi&#8208;gram&#8208;scale products of various MgVxOy&#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV2O5, spinel MgV2O4, and MgVO3) containing V3+ or V4+ relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of 25Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;assisted population transfer (RAPT) is used as a much&#8208;needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The ab&#8197;initio guided synthesis method is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance.

Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105 M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical mechanical responses, from elastic and elasto&#8208;plastic bending to exceptional malleability, have been realized at different stress and temperature conditions in crystals of a rhenium oxyacid salt. The extent of the molecular rotations/translations in the mechanism is governed by the crystal structure.







Abstract
Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of a dynamic crystal (1), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two&#8208;face elasticity (within &#8776;1&#8201;% strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at room temperature. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at &#8776;105&#8201;&#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#956;&#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in the rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.







Abstract
In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechano&#8208;chromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.

The coordination of monomeric LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and LiC6H5 molecules to a Mo2 core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X&#8208;ray and computational studies.







Abstract
LiCH3 and LiCH2CH3 react with the complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(thf)2] (1&#8901;thf) with coordination of two molecules of LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and formation of complexes [Mo2{&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)CH2R}2(AdDipp2)2], 5&#8901;LiCH3 and 5&#8901;LiCH2CH3, respectively (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; thf=C4H8O). Due to steric hindrance, only one molecule of LiC6H5 adds to 1&#8901;thf generating the complex [Mo2(H){&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)C6H5}(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2], (4&#8901;LiC6H5). Computational studies disclose the existence of five&#8208;center six&#8208;electron bonding within the H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C&#8722;Li metallacycles, with a mostly covalent H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C group and predominantly ionic Li&#8722;C and Li&#8722;H interactions. However, the latter bonds exhibit non&#8208;negligible covalency, as indicated by X&#8208;ray, computational data and the large one&#8208;bond 6,7Li,1H and 6,7Li,13C NMR coupling constants found for the three&#8208;atom H&#8722;Li&#8722;C chains. By contrast, the phenyl group in 4&#8901;LiC6H5 coordinates in an &#951;2 fashion to the lithium atom through the ipso and one of the ortho carbon atoms.

         <title>Microfluidic Fabrication of Hierarchical&#8208;Ordered ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx Core&#8211;Sheath Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>Chemically Engineered Porous Molecular Coatings as Reactive Oxygen Species Generators and Reservoirs for Long&#8208;Lasting Self&#8208;Cleaning Textiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials were prepared and used as textiles coatings to spontaneously convert absorbed oxygen from air into reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;termly store ROS in dark conditions. This work paves the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Wearable personal protective equipment that is decorated with photoactive self&#8208;cleaning materials capable of actively neutralizing biological pathogens is in high demand. Here, we developed a series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials capable of addressing this challenge. Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three&#8208;dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self&#8208;cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF&#8208;101&#8208;F shows a 10&#8208; to 60&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10&#8208; to 20&#8208;fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed iteration method to synthesize macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) aggregates with enhanced mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity of CH4 to effectively separate CH4/N2 is reported, which has significant potential for low&#8208;concentrated coalbed methane enrichment.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH4 separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed&#8208;passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH4 adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH4/N2 separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.

We characterized the first plant cycloartane glycosyltransferase AmGT8 from A. membranaceus. Its mutants A394F, A394D, and T131V were discovered using semi&#8208;rational design, which showed specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation activities, respectively. This study uncovered a conserved residue critical for the regiospecificity of plant glycosyltransferases.







Abstract
Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the C&#8208; and O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8208;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification procedure on a 15&#8208;component building block of achiral Ln24Ti8 wheel&#8208;like assemblies has been developed to obtain new accessible building blocks, resulting in a pair of new chiral enantiomers in elusive Ln&#8211;Ti systems.







Abstract
Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multi&#8208;component building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA=salicylic acid, Ln=Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA=5&#8208;methoxysalicylic acid, x=1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8722; unit makes the originally variable Ln chains become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and strain engineering combined. The combination of two engineered enzymes (a methyltransferase and an ammonia lyase) and an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain (for regeneration of the SAM cofactor) has been developed to enable a fully biocatalytic one&#8208;pot methylation&#8211;hydroamination cascade. As an example, the synthesis of l &#8208;veratrylglycine from renewable lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid has been demonstrated, in high yield and excellent ee.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be exploited to produce high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial E.&#8197;coli strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM in&#8197;vivo, and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the l&#8208;DOPA precursor l&#8208;veratrylglycine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) are developed for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. SPNCOX&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.







Abstract
Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E2 which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via photocontrolled radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP) is developed. A variety of acrylates or acrylamides can be copolymerized with the macrocyclic allylic sulfone with near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios at all feed compositions. The unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by sulfur dioxide in rROCCP was resolved by reducing the solubility of sulfur dioxide.







Abstract
Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>

A carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer CA&#8208;Re was developed. It is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.







Abstract
An ideal cancer treatment should not only destroy primary tumors but also improve the immunogenicity of the tumor microenvironment to achieve a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor immune effect. We designed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored rhenium(I) photosensitizer, named CA&#8208;Re, that not only performs type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT) with high efficiency under hypoxia (nanomolar&#8208;level phototoxicity), but also evokes gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptotic cell death to effectively stimulate tumor immunogenicity. CA&#8208;Re could disrupt and self&#8208;report the loss of membrane integrity simultaneously. This promoted the maturation and antigen&#8208;presenting ability of dendritic cells (DCs), and fully activated T cells dependent adaptive immune response in vivo, eventually eliminating distant tumors at the same time as destroying primary tumors. To the best of our knowledge, CA&#8208;Re is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer.

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>

Potion from the ocean: New peptide antibiotics from a sponge&#8208;derived bacterium are reported, featuring chlorination and an unusual amino&#8208;capped C&#8208;terminus. Studies on isolation, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and structure&#8211;activity relationships are presented.







Abstract
Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium Aquimarina sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarin residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

         <title>The First Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, and Its Acetylene Capture Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, uses earth&#8208;friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.







Abstract
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers). HUMs are of practical interest because of their benchmark gas separation performance for several industrial gas mixtures. We report herein design and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the prototypal sulfate&#8208;linked HUM, the fsc topology coordination network ([Zn(tepb)(SO4)]n), SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, tepb=(tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene). Alignment of the sulfate anions enables strong binding to C2H2 via O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC interactions but weak CO2 binding, affording a new benchmark for the difference between C2H2 and CO2 heats of sorption at low loading (&#916;Qst=24&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Dynamic column breakthrough studies afforded fuel&#8208;grade C2H2 from trace (1&#8201;:&#8201;99) or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H2/CO2 mixtures, outperforming its SiF62&#8722; analogue, SIFSIX&#8208;22&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

     alt="Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead-Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An up-conversion nanoparticles and Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual-color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high-quality optical anticounterfeiting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high-quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up- and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;,Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; as core and a CsMnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr Intermetallic Nanowires Prepared through a Silica&#8208;Protection Strategy for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires supported on commercial carbon were synthesized. Coating with SiO2 and the addition of Ir enabled the integrity of the nanowire structure to be maintained during their transformation from a disordered fcc&#8208;phase to an ordered fct&#8208;phase. The fct&#8208;phase nanowires exhibited much better ORR activity and structural and electrochemical stability than the fcc&#8208;phase ones.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is a way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are promising ORR catalysts, but their application is hampered by activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, the preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6&#8197;nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure (fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C) is reported. A silica&#8208;protected strategy prevents the deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during the phase transition at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and commercial Pt/C (0.21&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained after stability tests, showing the advantages of the ordered structure.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) was systematically investigated on a single nanoparticle level using nanoparticle impact electrochemistry, which enables in&#8208;depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system, allowing quantitative analysis of the increased reaction possibility and the decreased activation energy. This work reveals the intrinsic physicochemical information at the nano&#8208;confined domains.







Abstract
The structure&#8211;function relationship of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalysts, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of an efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating cobalt metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOFNs) catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon&#8208;excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst can firstly hook to bacteria and biofilm, then catalyze H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals for localized disinfection. Upon the near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, the bionanocatalyst can generate heat, which simultaneously accelerates the catalytic therapy and enables the heat ablation against bacteria.







Abstract
Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC's pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.

Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of polyoxometalates (POMs) within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes is shown, demonstrating that the level of carbon oxidation and the efficacy of the filling are determined by the frontier orbital energies of the POM. Nanoencapsulation is found to confer significant stability to polyoxomolybdates despite their inherent lability.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide detailed mechanistic insights into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these and similar nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8211;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86&#8201;% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles, despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.







Abstract
Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiIII&#8208;NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni2+ in NiII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8722;O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni2+ metal centers (t2g6eg2) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (NiII&#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) for NiIII&#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in NiIII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni3+ sites with the intermediate LiO2 promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 in the void space among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O2 battery based on NiIII&#8208;NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O2 batteries and beyond.

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically chiral SuFEx (sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange) click reaction was used to produce a series of configurationally chiral high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. This step&#8208;growth polymerization occurs with high efficiency and enantiospecifically (ee&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced via this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding MnPS up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &#272; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.

&lt;sup&gt;PS&lt;/sup&gt; up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide-containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main-chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor-made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TMSCF2Br&#8208;Enabled Fluorination&#8211;Aminocarbonylation of Aldehydes: Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines has been developed, in which the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success of this multicomponent process.







Abstract
A protocol for the modular assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8211;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the in situ formed TMS&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module&#8212;An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module in these ionic species is reported. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields (IQYs) up to 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials with excellent structural variety and optical tunability. Among them, copper halide hybrid molecular compounds with discrete inorganic modules are particularly interesting due to their high quantum efficiency. However, synthesizing highly efficient blue&#8208;emitting molecular clusters remains challenging. Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98&#8201;%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare&#8208;earth&#8208;element free light&#8208;emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Mesoporosity&#8208;Enabled Selectivity of Mesoporous Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals Catalysts in Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporosity engineering is demonstrated as an efficient route for boosting catalytic selectivity of Pd&#8208;based nanobundle catalysts in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of mesoporous Pd&#8208;based catalysts synergistically weaken the adsorption and binding strength of alkenes and energetically disable further over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.







Abstract
We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.

         <title>Multiple Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanostructures have been decorated with photosensitive reaction centers that produce reactive oxygen species at their individual characteristic wavelengths. In this way, polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine is induced and independent polymer patterning on the DNA origami template can be directed. In addition, the polymer rings alter the interaction of DNA origami objects and cell membranes, thereby promoting their cellular uptake.







Abstract
The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multiple wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective maximum wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed method provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quadruple helicene having two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92 sp2 carbon atoms. It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848&#8197;nm and 977&#8197;nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, feasible, and simple approach for dynamic tunable afterglow systems based on a simple radiative energy transfer mechanism is presented. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) can be reversibly converted between different colors in the solid, solution, and gel states by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor through a simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function relies on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with a traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &#963;&#8208;donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low&#8208;coordinate, cationic GeII and SnII ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni0, despite being &#963;&#8208;donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni0 complexes, [PhRDippENi(PPh3)3]+ (4&#8201;a/b (Ge) and 5 (Sn); PhRDipp={[Ph2PCH2SiR2](Dipp)N}&#8722;; R=Ph, iPr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic EII centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH3. Further, the GeII centre in 4&#8201;a/b readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF6]&#8722; to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex PhRDippGe(F)Ni(PPh3)3 9, despite this GeII centre simultaneously being a &#963;&#8208;donating ligand towards Ni0. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of 4 and 5 in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.

Pyroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death that is essentially proinflammatory and critical for immunity. In their Research Article(e202115800), Qian Cao, Zong&#8208;Wan Mao, and co&#8208;workers developed a carbonic anhydrase&#8197;IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer, CA&#8208;Re, that is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. CA&#8208;Re is the first metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a promising avenue for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.

Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials. In their Research Article (e202115225), Wei Liu, Gangfeng Ouyang et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module with a neutral organic ligand molecule. By using this approach, a family of blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures have been prepared with high internal quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%.

Gene fusion is an important natural process to create new enzymes from simpler ancestors. Gerrit&#8197;J. Poelarends and co&#8208;workers have adopted this strategy in their Communication (e202113970) to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient enzyme for enantioselective Michael reactions. They designed a tandem fused 4&#8208;OT that has reduced structural symmetry, expanding its optimization potential by allowing independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits, and thus enlarging the protein sequence space that can be travelled by directed evolution.

         <title>A Molecular Pump Facilitates Mechanical Adsorption Away from Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching or embedding biological or artificial molecular pumps to or into a surface or interface to achieve compartmentalization enables their unidirectional molecular motion to be organized in a confined environment. This approach led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way towards building highly complex organized molecular architectures.







Abstract
Artificial molecular pumps that perform unidirectional motion on the molecular scale have been used to design systems operating away from equilibrium. Crafting such pumps onto a surface allows their unidirectional movement to be organized in a confined environment as well as the active pumping of adsorbents from the bulk solution to the surface. This study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way for the construction of highly complex organized molecular architectures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent infections and deaths caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are a worldwide health issue. Molecularly imprinted polymers that are antibody mimics with selective recognition sites for a target molecule can fight these bacteria on several fronts. The targets range from endotoxins, &#946;&#8208;lactamase and adhesins to biofilm components and quorum sensing messengers.







Abstract
Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this serious societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has flourished, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude with the current challenges and future developments in this field.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio&#8208;interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.







Abstract
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing. We summarize the biological profiles and immune responses of various FNAs as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts to apply FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this Minireview can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNAs and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less symmetry, more diversity: Here we show that gene duplication and fusion to break structural symmetry, allowing independent sequence diversification of neighboring subunits by directed evolution, is a powerful strategy to boost catalysis by a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), enabling efficient asymmetric Michael additions.







Abstract
Gene duplication and fusion are among the primary natural processes that generate new proteins from simpler ancestors. Here we adopted this strategy to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective Michael reactions. We first designed a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT to allow independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits by directed evolution. This fused 4&#8208;OT was then subjected to eleven rounds of directed evolution to give variant 4&#8208;OT(F11), which showed an up to 320&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the Michael addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehydes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that 4&#8208;OT(F11) has an unusual asymmetric trimeric architecture in which one of the monomers is flipped 180&#176; relative to the others. This gene duplication and fusion strategy to break structural symmetry is likely to become an indispensable asset of the enzyme engineering toolbox, finding wide use in engineering oligomeric proteins.

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208; and acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclopropanation of naphthols from cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening has been described. The reaction is scalable and highly chemoselective, and the vinyl cyclopropane products can be uniquely diversified. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules&#8221; constructed by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry serve as flexibly designable supramolecular huge templates and demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials. This concept for the creation of larger inorganic nanomaterials using even larger organic molecules will provide a crucial key to exploring the last frontier in nanoscience.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules, while their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic phenylazomethine dendron units onto host acidic core units with six tritylium cations, the dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule accumulating multiple acidic rhodium salts in its basic ligands enabled a precise synthesis of rhodium particles via formation of multinuclear complexes. The obtained particles (Rh84, &#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) have particle sizes within 1&#8211;3&#8197;nm range and were larger than conventional sub&#8208;nanoparticles (Rh14, &#8776;0.85&#8197;nm), therefore the precise template synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Transformer&#8208;Induced Metamorphosis of Polymeric Nanoparticle Shape at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shape of nanoparticles is a crucial parameter that affects their fundamental properties. Herein, we report a straightforward approach wherein addition of a small organic molecule (transformer) can induce metamorphosis of the nanoparticle shape without altering the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. Importantly, this method is applicable to various block copolymers without requiring the synthesis of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Controlled polymerizations have enabled the production of nanostructured materials with different shapes, each exhibiting distinct properties. Despite the importance of shape, current morphological transformation strategies are limited in polymer scope, alter the chemical structure, require high temperatures, and are fairly tedious. Herein we present a rapid and versatile morphological transformation strategy that operates at room temperature and does not impair the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. By simply adding a molecular transformer to an aqueous dispersion of polymeric nanoparticles, a rapid evolution to the next higher&#8208;order morphology was observed, yielding a range of morphologies from a single starting material. Significantly, this approach can be applied to nanoparticles produced by disparate block copolymers obtained by various synthetic techniques including emulsion polymerization, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly and traditional solution self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>

Electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) enables production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 compatible with existing industrial processes. Herein we demonstrate the advantages of a methanation active catalyst, including superior activity, favorable temperature profile, and suppression of carbon formation.







Abstract
Utilization of CO2 is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. The reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO2 by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel&#8208;type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H2&#8201;:&#8201;CO2 in a ratio of 2.25 at 10&#8197;barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#8201;&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH4 as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions&#8208;free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H2/CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.

         <title>Hydrogenative Cycloisomerization and Sigmatropic Rearrangement Reactions of Cationic Ruthenium Carbenes Formed by Catalytic Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented hydrogenation reactions are disclosed, commencing with geminal delivery of both H&#8208;atoms of H2 to the triple bond of a propargyl alcohol derivative. When catalyzed with cationic ruthenium complexes, the resulting pianostool carbenes are so &#8220;hot&#8221; that they are readily intercepted by tethered nucleophiles, resulting in cycloisomerization or [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of propargyl alcohol derivatives with [CpXRu(MeCN)3]PF6 (CpX=substituted cyclopentadienyl) as catalysts affords cationic pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes which are so electrophilic that they attack a tethered olefin to furnish cyclopentene products; cyclopropanation or metathesis do not compete with this novel transformation. If the transient carbenes carry appropriate propargylic substituents, however, they engage in ([2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic) rearrangements to give enol esters (carbonates, carbamates, sulfonates) or alkenyl halides. Both pathways are unprecedented in the vast hydrogenation literature. The proposed mechanistic scenarios are in line with labeling experiments and spectroscopic data; most notably, PHIP NMR spectroscopy (PHIP=parahydrogen induced polarization) provides compelling evidence that the reactions are indeed triggered by highly unorthodox gem&#8208;hydrogenation events.

         <title>A Mechanistically Inspired Halenium Ion Initiated Spiroketalization: Entry to Mono&#8208; and Dibromospiroketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halenium affinity (HalA) guided design leads to stereoselective bromospiroketalization of alkyl ketones, templated by a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol. Subtle alteration of the reaction conditions provides either the bromospiroketals or the dibromospiroketals.







Abstract
Employing halenium affinity (HalA) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by the templating effect of a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing monobromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the transient oxocarbenium towards &#945;&#8208;deprotonation that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketal motifs exhibited by several natural products.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity of Catalytic Hydroboration with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controllable, chemoselective hydroboration of ketoacids is reported using a well&#8208;defined cobalt hydride catalyst. Excellent selectivities can be achieved, with acids reacting in the dark and ketones in the light. This approach can be further extended to other functional groups.







Abstract
The ability to selectively react one functional group in the presence of another underpins efficient reaction sequences. Despite many designer catalytic systems being reported for hydroboration reactions, which allow introduction of a functional handle for cross&#8208;coupling or act as mild method for reducing polar functionality, these platforms rarely deal with more complex systems where multiple potentially reactive sites exist. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to use light to distinguish between ketones and carboxylic acids in more complex molecules. By taking advantage of different activation modes, a single catalytic system can be used for hydroboration, with the chemoselectivity dictated only by the presence or absence of visible light.

A simple, cell&#8208;permeable source of PdII is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd0 through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in&#8208;cell generation of Pd0 enables Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.







Abstract
Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions.

This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells.

&lt;p&gt;A simple, cell-permeable source of Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in-cell generation of Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; enables Pd-mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond-cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond-cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water-soluble Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a simple source of Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species. Once generated, Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd-mediated bioorthogonal reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vectorial Catalysis in Surface&#8208;Anchored Nanometer&#8208;Sized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Microfluidic Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Controlling multiple reactions in a programmed manner and defined spatial localization is a key goal in catalysis, which is referred to as vectorial catalysis. We realized a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based vectorial catalysis system by anchoring two different nano&#8208;MOFs at precise spatial positions in the microfluidic device and tested their performance in the catalysis of a two&#8208;step reaction sequence.







Abstract
Vectorial catalysis&#8212;controlling multi&#8208;step reactions in a programmed sequence and by defined spatial localization in a microscale device&#8212;is an enticing goal in bio&#8208;inspired catalysis research. However, translating concepts from natural cascade biocatalysis into artificial hierarchical chemical systems remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate integration of two different surface&#8208;anchored nanometer&#8208;sized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a microfluidic device for modelling vectorial catalysis. Catalyst immobilization at defined sections along the microchannel and a two&#8208;step cascade reaction was conducted with full conversion after 30&#8197;seconds and high turnover frequencies (TOF&#8776;105&#8197;h&#8722;1).

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Disulfide Bond Self&#8208;Heals Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized polyurethane is used as an additive to self&#8208;heal a CsPbIBr2 film by a disulfide&#8208;exchange reaction upon heat treatment. The inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 10.61&#8201;% with efficiency recovery after heat treatment.







Abstract
One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light, etc. Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61&#8201;% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in an air atmosphere over 80&#8197;days and persistent heat attack (85&#8201;&#176;C) over 35&#8197;days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.

         <dc:description>
A doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron&#8208;deficient, NIR&#8208;emitting B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon cyclization compared to non&#8208;fused derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (B2&#8208;HBP), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr3/AlCl3/2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, B2&#8208;HBP absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, B2&#8208;HBP possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V and &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc. Our methodology is surprisingly selective despite its implementation of unfunctionalized precursors and offers a new approach to the synthesis of pristine B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
