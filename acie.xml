         <title>Through Stronger Hindrance to Higher Reactivity: Influence of the Alkyl Chains on the Activation Energy of Ether Cleavage on Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For ether cleavage on Si(001), steric hindrance by the side chains was shown to determine the reactivity on the surface. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state.








Abstract
Reactivity in surface chemistry is often discussed in terms of the interaction between surface states and the functional groups of the reacting molecule. Herein, we demonstrate that for finite submonolayer coverage, i.e., surface coverage at which the molecular adsorbates cannot be treated as isolated molecules anymore, the seemingly innocent side chains of the adsorbate can also play a decisive role. For the example of ether cleavage on Si(001), which represents the surface analogue of an SN${\rm S}_{\rm N}$2&#8208;type reaction, we show both experimentally and based on ab initio calculations that steric hindrance by the side chains determines the activation energy for C&#8208;O dissociation into the final state. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state. Given the fact that for almost all technologically relevant processes the surface coverage is typically above the isolated&#8208;molecule limit, our findings are of general importance for surface functionalization and can help to properly design future&#160;experiments.

         <title>A Cathepsin B&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Releasing Molecule with a Non&#8208;Toxic Metal Core for Targeted Tumor Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based, enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) is site&#8208;specifically conjugated to the antibody trastuzumab. This novel ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;antibody conjugate releases carbon monoxide upon cleavage by the tumor&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B. The construct enables selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells, presenting a new strategy for targeted, CO&#8208;based cancer therapies.








Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) has shown therapeutic potential across various diseases, including cancer. To enable controlled delivery, many CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed. However, their clinical translation has been limited due to concerns about stability, potential toxicity, and insufficient targeting ability. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of an enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) that can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to antibodies. This novel ET&#8208;CORM is built on a biocompatible iron core, and releases CO upon cleavage by the cancer&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B (CatB). The incorporation of a bioorthogonal handle into ET&#8208;CORM enabled its efficient and site&#8208;specific conjugation to the clinically used antibody trastuzumab us of the interchain disulfide bonds. The resulting ET&#8208;CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate (ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;Ab) exhibited an average drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) of 6.8, corresponding to approximately 20 CO molecules per conjugate. This construct allowed for selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells in vitro. This study represents a metal&#8208;based CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate activated by a tumor&#8208;associated enzymatic trigger, opening new avenues for investigating CO&#8208;mediated effects and advancing CO&#8208;based cancer therapies to the clinics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Formation of Ultrathin Conjugated Coordination Frameworks with Homogeneous Edge Effect Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Co&#8208;DABDT, a d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination framework (c&#8208;MCFs), as a model catalyst, the homogenic edge effect was regulated by the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment. Reduced layer plate thickness enables homogeneous edge curvatures to optimize interface charge/electric field distribution and strengthen oxidation intermediate adsorption, achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity.








Abstract
The d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination frameworks (c&#8208;MCFs) are a type of emerging crystalline porous material. However, due to the interlayer conjugation effect, the clusters tend to assemble into 3D architectures, making it difficult to directly prepare ultrathin 2D structures. Herein, by reasonably regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment, the interlayer conjugation effect of the Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT&#160;=&#160;2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) layer was effectively inhibited, and ultrathin c&#8208;MCFs were efficiently constructed. Using it as a suitable model catalyst, the solvent environment was optimized, and Co&#8208;DABDT with different homogenic edge curvatures was synthesized, including bulk Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;B), layered Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;L), and Co&#8208;DABDT nanosheet (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS). Among these, Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS has the highest homogenic edge curvatures, with the optimal onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.97 and 0.82&#160;VRHE, respectively. Experimental and theoretical results show that as the layer plate thickness decreases, the homogenic edge curvatures can optimize the interface charge and electric field distribution and enhance the adsorption of oxidation intermediates, thereby achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. The results indicate that the role of this morphology&#8208;induced local field enhances the ORR kinetics and provides a new perspective for the study of catalyst morphology&#8208;field effect&#8208;catalytic kinetics.

         <title>Electrostatic and Geometric Regulation of &#8220;Third Terminal&#8221; in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural characteristics of INIC, we first proposed to establish the &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of NFAs by regulating delicate electrostatic and geometric of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC) at backbone centers, aiming to improving charge transfer/transport in OSCs. As a consequence, the OSC based on CH56 binary device achieves a surprising VOC &gt;1&#160;V and ternary device displays an excellent efficiency of 20.16%.








Abstract
Inspired by the dominant role of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene) malononitrile (INCN) terminal in regulating molecular packing, an innovative strategy to construct &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed by introducing INIC&#8208;mimicking motifs to molecular backbone center. Through delicate electrostatic and geometric regulation of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC), newly designed NFAs (CH56, CH57, and CH58) render not only an inverted distribution of molecular frontier orbitals, but also the substantial HOMO&#8211;LUMO overlap for CH56 while pronounced spatial separation for others. Especially, the puckered TCNC with the most LUMOs distribution yet minimal involvement in molecular packings drives CH58 to adopt a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (3D) packing network and inferior electron migration in sharp contrast to CH56. Moreover, the twisty CH57 and CH58 also exhibit unexpectedly quenched fluorescence due to the severe skeletal vibrations DCNQ and TCNC, further resulting in the large energy losses and poor photovoltaic performance. Finally, CH56&#8208;based OSCs yield a surprising open&#8208;circuit&#8208;voltage of 1.007&#160;V for binary devices and an excellent 20.16% efficiency for ternary devices. Our trials on &#8220;third terminal&#8221; has enabled the extensive exploration of novel architectures of NFAs beyond conventional structural paradigms.

         <title>Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag Interface to Decouple Reactant Activation for Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Ester Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces on Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 decouple the activation of H2 and ester substrates in dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation. Electron transfer generates electron&#8208;rich Ag sites for facile H2 dissociation and adjacent electron&#8208;deficient NiOx sites for preferential DMO adsorption, mitigating competitive adsorption. This cooperative architecture enables rapid H2 spillover, timely desorption of methyl glycolate, and exceptional stability, highlighting interfacial inversion as a versatile catalytic design paradigm.








Abstract
Achieving simultaneous high activity, selectivity, and stability in ester hydrogenation remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the competitive adsorption of reactants at active sites. Here, we introduce an inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interface as a general design platform to spatially decouple the activation of H2 and ester, exemplified with dimethyl oxalate (DMO). The catalyst (Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2), synthesized via controlled partial reduction of Ni phyllosilicate followed by Ag deposition, features electron&#8208;rich Ag sites and electron&#8208;deficient interfacial Ni sites arising from interfacial electron transfer. Comprehensive characterizations reveal abundant NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces with modified coordination and electronic structures. In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption/surface reaction, and H2&#8208;D2 isotope exchange experiments demonstrate that H2 is preferentially dissociated at Ag sites, while DMO adsorbs and activates on NiOx sites, effectively mitigating competitive adsorption. Theoretical calculations confirm the cooperative nature of the interface, showing low barriers for H2 dissociation and favorable desorption energetics for methyl glycolate (MG), suppressing over&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalyst delivers a turnover frequency of 944.4 h&#8722;1 with &#8764;99% selectivity to MG over 500&#160;h of continuous operation, among the highest reported for DMO hydrogenation. This work establishes interfacial inversion engineering as a versatile approach to optimize site complementarity in multi&#8208;step catalytic transformations.

         <title>Aquatic Environment Breaks the Size Confinement of the TiO2 Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 exhibits an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 particles. This novel aqueous interface regulation enhances the surface energy of submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 anode, thereby increasing their robustness in aqueous battery systems. The submicron TiO2 can be scaled up into an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. The pouch cell can achieve a high energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) with superior electrochemical performance of 1200 cycles.








Abstract
The particle size of TiO2 anodes is commonly believed to have a negative impact on their mechanical properties. As submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 exhibits low surface energy, which reduces yield strength and leads to mechanical fracture during the two&#8208;phase lithium storage mechanism, it is excluded from traditional nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, we discovered that TiO2 demonstrates an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2. Our studies reveal that water molecules strongly interact with submicron TiO2 materials, increasing the surface energy in aqueous electrolytes in a unique manner. This enhancement makes submicron TiO2 more resilient during the lithiation and de&#8208;lithiation reactions. Additionally, the transition from nano to submicron TiO2 facilitates the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in aqueous batteries and enhances the performance of electrode coatings. Consequently, submicron TiO2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance in aqueous batteries, with an Ah&#8208;level pouch battery achieving an energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) and demonstrating excellent cycling stability of over 1200 cycles. Our work has successfully addressed the size limitations of the TiO2 anodes, offering an innovative perspective on micro&#8208;sized electrode materials previously considered unsuitable for battery use.

         <title>Modular Access to sp3&#8208;Rich Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Bioisosteres via Energy&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;enabled strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted BCPs via strain&#8208;release triplet carbene addition to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). Key advantages include the modular installation of versatile bridge ester substituents, enabling downstream diversification, while retaining the bridgehead substituents from the BCB precursor. Experimental and DFT studies support a mechanism involving photoinduced energy transfer to generate a triplet carbene, followed by addition across the highly strained C&#9472;C &#963; bond of the BCB framework.








Abstract
Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are increasingly recognized as valuable sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;disubstituted benzene rings, offering improved pharmacokinetic properties and broad utility in drug discovery. Herein, we report an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;enabled strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted BCPs via strain&#8208;release triplet carbene addition to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). This method employs readily accessible diazoacetates and a diverse set of BCBs under mild blue&#8208;light irradiation, providing direct access to 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCPs. Key advantages include the modular installation of versatile bridge ester substituents, enabling downstream diversification, while retaining the bridgehead substituents from the BCB precursor. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated through the preparation of BCP analogues of bioactive fragments. Combined experimental and DFT studies support a mechanism involving photoinduced energy transfer to generate a triplet carbene, followed by stepwise addition across the highly strained C&#9472;C &#963; bond of the BCB framework.

         <title>An Orthogonal Nucleic Acid/Peptide Amplification Circuit Enables Protease&#8208;Triggered, Cancer Cell&#8208;Selective PD&#8208;L1 Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating peptide&#8208;mediated protease activation and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition with DNA hybridization chain reaction, an orthogonal amplification circuit was developed for cancer&#8208;selective PD&#8208;L1 imaging. The spatially controlled imaging of membrane PD&#8208;L1 enables pre&#8208;treatment assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in vivo.








Abstract
Molecular imaging offers a powerful approach for in situ detection of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), however, achieving cancer cell&#8208;selective imaging that discriminates PD&#8208;L1 expression on malignant versus normal cells remains a challenge. Here, we present an orthogonal nucleic acid/peptide amplification circuit that integrates protease&#8208;activated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with aptamer&#8208;mediated target recognition for cancer&#8208;selective PD&#8208;L1 imaging. In the design, PD&#8208;L1 aptamer is coupled with an HCR initiator for targeting PD&#8208;L1, while PNA is employed as a bridge scaffold to engineer the initiator with protease&#8208;responsive peptide substrate and thus block the HCR. Within the tumor microenvironment, protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage liberates the initiator, thereby triggering localized HCR amplification at PD&#8208;L1 sites. In contrast, in normal tissues lacking the relevant proteases, the initiator remains inactive, yielding markedly improved spatial selectivity for cancer cell&#8208;specific PD&#8208;L1 imaging. Using mouse models, we further demonstrate that this strategy allows for non&#8208;invasive assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This methodology will build a bridge between DNA nanobiotechnology and peptide&#8208;based biochemistry for diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Harnessing Deaminated DNA to Modulate mRNA Translation for Controlled and Sequential Protein Expression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damaged DNA regulates the kinetics of mRNA translation in cells, which is a critical parameter for the safe and effective use of mRNA therapeutics. Simple annealing of damaged DNA to mRNA enables up to a 20&#8208;fold reduction in expression rate with a &#8764;200&#8208;min delay. This strategy requires no chemical modification of the mRNA and generates only nontoxic/recyclable DNA fragments, making it broadly applicable to therapeutic settings.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) offers transformative potential in vaccines and therapeutics for a range of intractable diseases. While considerable efforts have focused on enhancing protein expression levels to improve efficacy, comparatively little attention has been given to regulating the rate and timing of protein expression. Given that sudden antigen bursts can overstimulate immune responses and pose serious risks in susceptible individuals, precise control over translation kinetics is essential for safe and personalized mRNA therapies. Herein, we describe the use of &#8220;damaged&#8221; DNA to modulate translation rates of mRNAs. Hybridization of deoxyuridine&#8208;containing DNA to the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of mRNA inhibits translation initiation, which is subsequently displaced via base excision repair (BER), enabling controlled expression. DNA strand lengths determine the rate and onset of translation (e.g., a 52&#8208;nt DNA induces a 20&#8208;fold slower expression with a 200&#8208;min delay). This also enables the sequential expression of multiple mRNAs from a single cocktail. This strategy requires no chemical modification of the mRNA and produces no toxic byproducts, but only recyclable DNA fragments&#8212;offering a broadly applicable and biocompatible adjuvant for controlled mRNA translation.

&lt;p&gt;Damaged DNA regulates the kinetics of mRNA translation in cells, which is a critical parameter for the safe and effective use of mRNA therapeutics. Simple annealing of damaged DNA to mRNA enables up to a 20-fold reduction in expression rate with a &#8764;200-min delay. This strategy requires no chemical modification of the mRNA and generates only nontoxic/recyclable DNA fragments, making it broadly applicable to therapeutic settings.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing NIR&#8208;II Emission, Type&#8208;I, and Type&#8208;II Photosensitization Through Acceleration of Charge&#8208;Separated&#8208;State Formation for Tumor Phototheranostics</title>

         <dc:description>
By accelerating the transition from a localized excited (LE) state to a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state via cascade methods of acceptor engineering and aggregated architecture optimization, an 808&#160;nm laser excitable multifunctional phototheranostic agent 6TP&#8208;IH was developed that shows 15.6&#8208;, 2.21&#8208;, and 3.18&#8208;fold improvements in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence intensity, &#8226;OH and 1O2 generation efficiencies, respectively. Consequently, it exhibits a very high tumor inhibition rate of 99.1% in phototheranostics. 








Abstract
Phototheranostic agents with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation wavelengths offer significant promise for tumor imaging and therapy. However, due to the limitations imposed by the energy gap law, such agents tend to generate heat while exhibiting limited photosensitization effects and fluorescence intensity, which hampers their combination therapy efficacy. Herein, we present an effective strategy of &#8220;acceleration of charge&#8208;separated&#8208;state formation&#8221; to simultaneously enhance NIR&#8208;II emission, type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photosensitization efficiencies of NIR excitable phototheranostic agents. Specifically, following the optimization of the chemical structure and aggregated architecture, the rate of transition from localized excited (LE) state to charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is improved from 1.19&#160;&#215;&#160;109&#160;s&#8722;1 (in toluene) and 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;s&#8722;1 (in water) for 8TP&#8208;IF to 4.69&#160;&#215;&#160;109&#160;s&#8722;1 (in toluene) and 1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;s&#8722;1 (in water) for 6TP&#8208;IH. As a consequence, upon NIR 808&#160;nm excitation, the fluorescence, &#8226;OH and 1O2 generation efficiencies of 6TP&#8208;IH are improved to 15.6, 2.21, and 3.38 times to those of 8TP&#8208;IF. Encapsulation of 6TP&#8208;IH into nanoparticles (NPs) enables their application in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor combination therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirm the precise tumor imaging capability of 6TP&#8208;IH NPs, along with robust tumor ablation and effective activation of tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) through synergistic photodynamic and photothermal therapy. These effects collectively yield an impressive tumor inhibition rate of 99.1% in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization and Morphology&#8208;Depended Photoconductivity Modulation in a Squaraine&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Squaraine Bulk p/n Heterojunction</title>

         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecule with squaraine donor and NDI acceptor linked by an amide linker undergoes supramolecular polymerization forming nanoscale p/n heterojunctions. Depending on solvent polarity, this process yields J&#8208;type crystalline nanoparticle&#8208;like or H&#8211;type amorphous fibrous aggregates, in which the former exhibits approximately twice the photoconductivity of the latter.








Abstract
We designed a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecule, TISQ, consisting of squaraine as the electron donor and naphthalene diimide as the electron acceptor, connected via amide linkages that promote hydrogen bonding. This molecule undergoes self&#8208;assembly with spatial segregation of donor and acceptor moieties depending on the nature of the solvent. In polar solvents, J&#8208;type aggregates are formed via a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation mechanism, whereas in low&#8208;polarity solvents, H&#8208;type aggregates are formed through an isodesmic pathway. Microscopic analyses showed that J&#8208;type aggregates adopt nanoparticle&#8208;like morphologies, whereas H&#8208;type aggregates assemble into higher&#8208;order fibrous structures. Photoconductivity measurements demonstrated that J&#8208;type aggregates exhibit enhanced charge transport relative to H&#8208;type aggregates. The maximum transient photoconductivity (&#966;&#931;&#956;) of the J&#8208;type aggregate thin film reached 6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, exhibiting a photoconductivity 2.0 times greater than that of the H&#8208;type aggregate thin film (3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Although bulk heterojunction solar cells with photoactive layers of the D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecule face challenges in forming continuous macroscopic p/n heterojunctions, these findings underscore that controlled self&#8208;assembly of D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecules facilitates the formation of nanoscale p/n heterojunctions and the aggregate morphology plays a critical role in the charge transport.

Iron&#8211;NHC catalysis facilitates the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective 1,6&#8208;additions of aliphatic Grignard reagents to &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This rare transformation installs cis&#8208;olefins with enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%, thereby expanding access to chiral building blocks via the formation of remote C&#9472;C bonds.








Abstract
Although conjugate addition to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound is a well&#8208;established method in synthetic organic chemistry, controlling regioselectivity, olefin geometry, and positional isomerism in analogous 1,6&#8208;addition chemistry, which provides a powerful approach for constructing molecular complexity, remains a key challenge. Herein, we report the iron&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective 1,6&#8208;additions of aliphatic Grignard reagents to &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The incorporation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand effectively suppresses undesired &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, thereby enabling the highly cis&#8208;selective installation of the aliphatic group. Remarkably, the use of a rigid tetracyclic chiral NHC ligand afforded the corresponding adducts with enantioselectivities of up to 99%. The developed reaction shows broad substrate scope, accommodating various aliphatic Grignard reagents and unsaturated carbonyl compounds, thereby providing direct access to optically active 1,6&#8208;adducts bearing cis&#8208;configured olefins. Mechanistic investigations, including deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, support the involvement of magnesium enolates and an iron&#8211;NHC catalytic cycle. The developed transformation provides a powerful strategy for the remote functionalization of extended conjugated carbonyl frameworks.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Intersystem Crossing Efficiency and Bright Polymer Phosphorescence Enabled by Charge&#8208;Transfer Diarylketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer in asymmetric diarylketones was revealed to play pivotal role on their intersystem crossing (ISC), which was poorly understood in previous aromatic ketone phosphors. The ISC could finish within &#8764;10&#160;ps as probed by fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy. Copolymer engineering then translates these molecular properties into 3D materials that exhibit ultrabright and durable phosphorescence, paving the way for large&#8208;area application of organic afterglow. 








Abstract
Bonding aromatic ring to carbonyl group is recognized as crucial for promoting intersystem crossing (ISC) owing to allowed 1n&#960;* &#8594; 3&#960;&#960;* or 1&#960;&#960;* &#8594; 3n&#960;* transition. The effect of charge transfer (CT) in such systems, however, is largely ignored for understanding ISC and phosphorescence efficiency. Here, we unveiled a principle for producing highly&#8208;efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymer where the role of CT in diarylketone phosphors was a prerequisite. Designed diarylketones with carbonyl group substituted by aromatic rings unsymmetrically achieved superior RTP quantum yield of &gt;30% in copolymer. Detailed investigation indicated that 1CT&#8594;3LE (locally excited triplet state) transition with small energy gap (&#8710;EST) and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling underlies their ultrafast ISC, as recorded by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. When single aromatic ring was bonded to carbonyl group, singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states remained LE with large &#8710;EST and weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, leading to low RTP efficiency. Finally, manufacturing organic glass in presence of trace diarylketone monomers could generate shape&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional (3D) objects with intense afterglow under room lighting, even at high&#8208;temperature and wet conditions. This work advances understanding on structure&#8208;property relationship in popular aromatic ketone phosphors, and paves the way for producing afterglow materials with high brightness and stability.

         <title>Grafting Cell&#8208;Penetrating Poly(disulfide)s to Substrates of Interest: Dynamic Covalent Bioconjugation for Traceless Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting&#8208;to rather than the grafting&#8208;from strategy envisioned 10 years ago is shown to make cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s compatible with dynamic covalent bioconjugation at high dilution (50&#160;nM) and top rates (1500&#160;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1), genetic engineering and transduction domains, that is traceless tags for protein delivery, including intact functional anti&#8208;NPC antibodies.








Abstract
Although increasingly understood and appreciated, thiol&#8208;mediated uptake (TMU) remains underused because practical traceless tags that solve daily delivery problems are not yet available. The most popular cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs) were initially introduced as traceless tags that could be grafted from any thiol&#8208;containing substrate of interest (SOI) in situ and would depolymerize in the cytosol right after uptake. This approach was operational but not ideal for solving practical problems because the concentrations of SOIs &gt;30&#160;&#181;M needed in neutral water are above those acceptable in most biological studies. Here, we report that CPD grafting&#8208;to SOIs, rather than grafting&#8208;from, provides access to dynamic covalent cysteine bioconjugation with protein concentrations down to 50&#160;nM, which is more than 600 times below standard grafting&#8208;from CPD chemistry. With rate constants up to 1500 M&#8722;1s&#8722;1, CPD grafting&#8208;to is as fast as the record covalent cysteine bioconjugation (heteroaromatic sulfones), in the range of the best bioorthogonal reaction (IEDDA), and 3000 times faster than cystine grafting&#8208;to. Experimental evidence for CPD grafting to probes, peptides and proteins with one, two, or several proximal thiols, efficient TMU of their conjugates, and the cytosolic release of functional SOIs, such as fluorescent antibodies against the nuclear pore complex, supports the discovery of operational traceless TMU tags, at last.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Adsorptive and Catalytic Reactions from Controllable Distributions of Metal Cations (Pd, Pt, Ni, Cr, Cu) as [M&#8208;OH]+1/1Al or M+2/2Al in Zeolites</title>

Selective anchoring of divalent metal ions (Pd, Pt, Ni, Cr, Cu) in zeolites as either M2&#8314;/2Al or [M&#9472;OH]2&#8314;/1Al enables direct comparison of their distinct catalytic roles. Combining reactive test, spectroscopy, and DFT reveals divergent reactivities in ethylene dimerization, Wacker oxidation, SCR, NO adsorption, and methane oxidation. 








Abstract
Anchoring divalent metal ions in the same zeolite framework with similar Si/Al ratio selectively as zeolite&#8208;bound M+2 or [M+2&#8208;OH]+1 cationic species enables critical comparison of the species&#8217; intrinsic reactivity for industrially and fundamentally relevant reactions. H&#8208;BEA zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios but differing framework Al siting were used to anchored multiple divalent metal cations (Ni, Pd, Pt, Cr, Cu) in the zeolite micropores. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art infrared (IR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, including two&#8208;dimensional pulsed HYSCORE EPR, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations together provide unambiguous evidence for the selective formation of divalent metal cations as M+2/2Al species (for H&#8208;BEA prepared in the conventional hydroxide media), and [M+2OH]+1/1Al species for H&#8208;BEA prepared in HF. Solid&#8208;state proton&#8208;decoupled triple&#8208;quantum magic&#8208;angle spinning (3Q MAS) NMR measurements confirmed contrasting Al distributions in the two H&#8208;BEA zeolites, which led to a contrasting divalent cation speciation. The reactivities of the two cationic species were explored for catalytic and adsorptive applications in both organometallic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This work demonstrates their divergent reactivity in ethylene dimerization, ethylene oxidation (Wacker process), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, NO adsorption, and methane oxidation. Both M+2/2Al and [M+2OH]+1/1Al cations are both active for ethylene dimerization, but [M+2OH]+1/1Al species show higher reaction rates for each Pd, Ni, Pt. [M+2OH]+1/1Al is active for acetaldehyde formation in Wacker ethylene oxidation. A new active site for ethylene oligomerization is proposed that possesses a terminal OH group (Cr&#8208;OH) in Phillips catalysts evident by a nearly inactive isolated Cr+2/2Al species that contrast an active Cr&#9472;OH motif.

         <title>Spirosilanes Activate Gold(I)&#8208;Catalysts in Cycloisomerization and Intermolecular Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirosilanes activate LAuCl complexes to promote catalysis. This silver&#8208;free activation through weak interactions is nondestructive so that low loadings of LAuCl are possible as well as their recycling. It can also be beneficial for asymmetric catalysis. 








Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions have established as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering efficient pathways to construct diverse molecular structures and notably scaffolds with high complexity. Most processes rely on the use of LAuCl precatalysts, which are generally activated, i.e., cationized, by silver salts. In this work, we explore the role of silicon&#8208;based Lewis acids based, such as spirosilane, derivatives as alternative activators in lieu of silver salts. It was found that Martin spirosilanes mediate the activation of gold precatalysts, facilitating diverse cyclization and cycloisomerization reactions as well as intermolecular reactions. NMR studies and computational investigations suggest that no real cationization, i.e., formation of an ionic pair, takes place, but rather activation through weak interaction between silicon and the chlorine atom of LAuCl. This preserves the Au&#9472;Cl bond and ultimately enables the LAuCl complex to be recovered.

     alt="Spirosilanes Activate Gold(I)-Catalysts in Cycloisomerization and Intermolecular Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirosilanes activate LAuCl complexes to promote catalysis. This silver-free activation through weak interactions is nondestructive so that low loadings of LAuCl are possible as well as their recycling. It can also be beneficial for asymmetric catalysis. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold-catalyzed reactions have established as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering efficient pathways to construct diverse molecular structures and notably scaffolds with high complexity. Most processes rely on the use of LAuCl precatalysts, which are generally activated, i.e., cationized, by silver salts. In this work, we explore the role of silicon-based Lewis acids based, such as spirosilane, derivatives as alternative activators in lieu of silver salts. It was found that Martin spirosilanes mediate the activation of gold precatalysts, facilitating diverse cyclization and cycloisomerization reactions as well as intermolecular reactions. NMR studies and computational investigations suggest that no real cationization, i.e., formation of an ionic pair, takes place, but rather activation through weak interaction between silicon and the chlorine atom of LAuCl. This preserves the Au&#9472;Cl bond and ultimately enables the LAuCl complex to be recovered. On the same line, the LAuCl&#8211;silane interaction has also proven to be beneficial for asymmetric catalysis. This work significantly contributes to the expansion of gold-catalyzed transformations by opening up the prospect of a more sustainable gold catalysis. It also opens perspectives on the use of silicon-based Lewis acids as versatile cooperative agents in organometallic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Cathode Interphase Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified framework for designing robust cathode interphases is established by elucidating the TM&#8208;O hybridization (&#916;&#948;) and interfacial bonding strength (ICOHP). Leveraging this principle, NFA additive enables stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage graphite||LCO and graphite||NMC811 cells.








Abstract
To unlock the potential of cyclability and energy density of Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), cathode interphase engineering is pivotal. However, a comprehensive methodology for rational cathode interphase design remains elusive. In this study, we propose a unified framework for designing robust cathode interphases by elucidating the role of heavy transition metal (TM)&#8208;oxygen (O) hybridization [quantified by the energy gap between TM 3d and O 2p orbitals (&#916;&#948;)] and the chemical bonding strength [measured by the integrals of crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP)] at the cathode surface. A large &#916;&#948;, coupled with a low ICOHP value, is identified as critical for forming an effective and stable cathode interphase. Guided by this principle, N&#8208;fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)amine (NFA) additive with high &#916;&#948; [0.432&#160;eV for LiCoO2 (LCO) and 0.350&#160;eV for LiNiO2] and low ICOHP values (&#8722;1.461&#160;eV for Co&#8208;N and &#8722;0.377&#160;eV for O&#8208;Li) is stood out, which effectively passivates aggressive high&#8208;voltage cathodes. This strategy enables superior battery cyclic performance, with 4.55&#160;V graphite||LCO pouch cells achieving over 357 cycles and 4.6&#160;V graphite||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells exceeding 400 cycles in carbonate electrolytes with simple formulations. The proposed cathode interphase design framework offers a promising pathway toward high&#8208;voltage LIBs with ultralong lifespans.

         <title>pH&#8208;Regulated Ring&#8208;Opening/Closing Transformation in Polyoxometalates Enables High&#8208;Performance Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by pH&#8208;regulated structural transformation, two selenium&#8208;containing polyoxometalates, NMSeO&#8208;5 and NMSeO&#8208;6, were synthesized. A reversible ring&#8208;opening/closing process dramatically boosts their nonlinear optical properties, with SHG intensity increasing from 0.07&#160;&#215;&#160;to 10&#160;&#215;&#160;that of KDP. Supported by DFT calculations, the acid&#8208;promoted mechanism reveals the construction pathway of POMs and provides a general strategy to advance SHG performance of POM&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Inorganic polyoxometalate (POM) crystals are a promising class of materials with considerable potential in modern laser science and technology. However, the limited understanding of POM formation mechanisms and the unclear structure&#8208;property relationship between POMs and nonlinear optics (NLO) have hindered the rational design and controllable synthesis of high&#8208;performance inorganic POM&#8208;based NLO crystals. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of two novel polar heteropolymolybdates, (NH4)4[Mo5O15(SeO3)2]&#183;2H2O (NMSeO&#8208;5) and (NH4)8[Mo6O18(SeO3)4]&#183;5H2O (NMSeO&#8208;6). Supported by theoretical calculations and experimental verification, we demonstrate, for the first time, pH&#8208;regulated ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing transformations in an inorganic POM system and propose a mechanistic pathway for their formation. Specifically, NMSeO&#8208;5, containing highly symmetrical Strandberg&#8208;type [Mo5O15(SeO3)2]2&#8722; clusters, undergoes structural transformation under strongly acidic conditions (H2SeO3) into NMSeO&#8208;6, which features a lower&#8208;symmetry, Reuleaux triangular [Mo6O18(SeO3)4]8&#8722; cluster. Remarkably, this transformation results in a dramatic enhancement of the second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 0.07&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP (NMSeO&#8208;5) to 10&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP (NMSeO&#8208;6). This work provides not only mechanistic insight into POM structural evolution but also establishes a paradigm for the design of next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;performance inorganic POM&#8208;based NLO materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Configurational Entropy in Spinel&#8208;type High Entropy Oxides during Discharge&#8211;Charge by Overcoming Kinetic Sluggish Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the phase evolution pathways in spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxides, revealing that the high entropy&#8208;mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion results in incomplete transformations of the rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like intermediate phase during discharge, ultimately causing unfavorable entropy&#8208;state transitions. However, reducing the solid&#8208;state diffusion length effectively overcomes these kinetic limitations, thereby preserving the desirable high&#8208;entropy state.








Abstract
Spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxides (HEOs) have emerged as promising next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes owing to exceptional electrochemical performance. However, suppressing irreversible phase transformations caused by high&#8208;entropy to low&#8208;entropy state transitions during discharge&#8211;charge has remained challenging. The core issue stems from an insufficient understanding of phase evolution pathways and the key thermodynamic/kinetic driving forces, which is due to current methodological limitations in analyzing highly disordered structures. Further complicating this challenge is the elusive impact of nanosized effects on both thermodynamic and kinetic processes. This study addresses these challenges through three synergistic approaches: 1) investigating phase evolution mechanisms across different particle sizes to delineate nanosized effects; 2) resolving complex local structures by pair distribution function analyses and 7Li magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 3) elucidating influences of high entropy on phase evolution via DFT calculations. Comprehensive results reveal a complex phase evolution process governed by the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic interplay. The incomplete phase transformations of the rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like intermediate phase during discharge, which are attributable to high entropy&#8208;mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion, account for the transition from high&#8208;entropy to low&#8208;entropy states. By shortening the solid&#8208;state diffusion lengths, the kinetic limitations can be overcome, as demonstrated by nanosized spinel&#8208;type HEOs achieving reversible phase transformations during discharge&#8208;charge.

         <title>Intra&#8208;Configurational Spin&#8208;Flip d&#8594;$ \to $d Transition of Mo (III) Doped Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Narrow Near Infrared&#8208;II Emission in Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped Mo3+ in Cs2NaInCl6 perovskite lattice in presence of reducing agent, H3PO2. This allows to achieve ambient stable ultra&#8208;narrow near infrared (NIR)&#8208;II photoluminescence featuring intra&#8208;configurational spin flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ (2T1g/2Eg &#8594;$\to$ 4A2g) transition of Mo3+. A detailed photophysics of multiple ICSF of Mo3+ has been studied. We designed a phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) showing ICFS NIR&#8208;II luminescence for the first time. 








Abstract
Sharp near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) emissions are typically achieved through f&#8594;f$f \to f$ electronic transitions of rare&#8208;earth ions, while d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transitions in transition metal ions are broad due to electron&#8211;ligand interactions. An exception is the intra&#8208;configurational spin&#8208;flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transition like t2g3 &#8594;$ \to $ t2g3 of Mo3+ emitting sharp NIR&#8208;II emission, but only at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum. The high oxophilicity of Mo3+ created defects during the synthesis, quenching the emission at room temperature. Herein, we overcome this issue by synthesizing Mo3+&#8722; doped Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskites in a reducing H3PO2 environment. [MoCl6]3&#8722; octahedra are formed, exhibiting ultra&#8208;narrow ICSF d&#8594;d$d \to d$ (2T1g/2Eg &#8594;$ \to $ 4A2g) NIR&#8208;II emission at 1095&#160;nm in ambient conditions. In addition, a second ICSF 2T2g &#8594;$ \to $ 4A2g emission is observed at 700&#160;nm, violating the Kasha's rule. The intensity of ICSF emissions increase with increasing temperature (7&#8211;350&#160;K) due to vibronic coupling relaxing the Laporte selection rule. The samples are stable for more than 6 months in ambient conditions, allowing for a detailed study of fundamental photophysics and fabrications of phosphor&#8208;converted light emitting diodes. This is the first Mo3+&#8211;based NIR&#8208;II optoelectronic device, opening opportunities for applications like optical fibers and lasing.

&lt;p&gt;We doped Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaInCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite lattice in presence of reducing agent, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This allows to achieve ambient stable ultra-narrow near infrared (NIR)-II photoluminescence featuring intra-configurational spin flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; &#8594;$\to$ &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;) transition of Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. A detailed photophysics of multiple ICSF of Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has been studied.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp near-infrared-II (NIR-II) emissions are typically achieved through f&#8594;f$f \to f$ electronic transitions of rare-earth ions, while d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transitions in transition metal ions are broad due to electron&#8211;ligand interactions. An exception is the intra-configurational spin-flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transition like t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &#8594;$ \to $ t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; emitting sharp NIR-II emission, but only at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum. The high oxophilicity of Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; created defects during the synthesis, quenching the emission at room temperature. Herein, we overcome this issue by synthesizing Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722; doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaInCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskites in a reducing H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; environment.

         <title>Defluoroalkylation of Trifluoromethane with Organolithium Reagents: Mechanism and Synthesis of Fluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rare example of the transformation of HCF3 into a fluoroalkene functional group through defluoroalkylation. We rationalise product formation through DFT calculations, scale&#8208;up the synthesis through continuous flow methods, and show that a fluoroalkene reagent derived from HCF3 is a competent nucleophile for the fluoroethenylation of a range of aldehydes.








Abstract
Trifluoromethane (HCF3, HFC&#8208;23) is a byproduct of fluoropolymer production that has limited applications. It is often stored or destroyed at the point of production, but if released into the environment is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 14&#160;600 times that of CO2. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical technologies for upgrading HCF3 typically occur with conservation of the CF3 group. These approaches will come under increased scrutiny as concern over the environmental impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continues to grow. A more sustainable approach involves synthetic transformations that repurpose the atomic content of HCF3 while also destroying the CF3 group. In this paper, we report a rare example of the transformation of HCF3 into a fluoroalkene functional group through defluoroalkylation. We rationalise product formation through DFT calculations, scale&#8208;up the synthesis through continuous flow methods, and show that a fluoroalkene reagent derived from HCF3 is a competent nucleophile for the fluoroethenylation of a range of aldehydes.

         <title>Selective Ion Transport Regulation Enables High Current Density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Conversion in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;transport regulation strategy is developed to customize the microenvironment during CO2 electroreduction in acidic electrolyte. A hybrid adlayer of ZrO2 nanosheets and Nafion preferentially allows K+ transport through proton trapping and Donnan effect, enriching K+ and raising pH near cathode surface. Such K+&#8208;rich alkaline microenvironment suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes C2+ products formation, resulting in a high C2+ Faraday efficiency (FE) of &#8764;81% with a partial current density of 484&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) under acidic condition offers great promise to achieve carbon&#8208;efficient CO2 electrolysis. However, acidic CO2RR has been hindered by the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon coupling efficiency. Herein, an ion&#8208;transport regulation strategy has been developed to customize the microenvironment near cathode surface during high current density electrolysis in acidic electrolyte. A hybrid adlayer composed of (010) planes&#8208;enclosed ZrO2 nanosheets and Nafion preferentially allows K+ transport toward cathode through proton trapping and Donnan effect, thus simultaneously enriching K+ and raising pH near cathode surface during CO2RR. Such K+&#8208;rich and alkaline microenvironment suppresses HER and favors C2+ products formation. Particularly, a remarkable C2+ Faraday efficiency (FE) of nearly 81% has been achieved with a partial current density of 484&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products on modified Cu electrode. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to boost the CO2RR performance in acidic electrolyzers for efficient and sustainable CO2 conversion.

         <title>Homogenizing Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers via Covalent Organic Frameworks for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A COF&#8208;modified SAM homogenization strategy was developed to address the critical issue of molecular aggregation and poor interfacial quality in MeO&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based inverted PSCs. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between COFs and MeO&#8208;4PACz effectively prevent aggregation, enhancing the charge transport and substrate wettability. PSCs employing Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF exhibit a champion PCE of 26.39% (certified as 26.12%) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have emerged as promising hole transport layers (HTLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their unique capability to modulate energy level alignment and interfacial quality. However, the widely used SAM molecule [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;4PACz) suffers from molecular aggregation, poor wettability with perovskite precursors, and limited electrical conductivity, which together hinder the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient charge extraction. Herein, we propose a rational SAM homogenization strategy by introducing two tailor&#8208;designed covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;PT&#8208;COF and Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF&#8212;into MeO&#8208;4PACz SAMs via co&#8208;assembly. These COFs are designed with rigid porphyrin cores to enhance charge transport and flexible hydrophilic side chains to improve substrate wettability. The incorporation of COFs effectively disrupts MeO&#8208;4PACz aggregation through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding, resulting in uniform, conductive, and well&#8208;anchored SAMs. Consequently, the modified SAMs promote perovskite crystallization, reduce buried interface defects, and improve charge extraction. Devices employing Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF&#8208;modified SAMs exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.39% (certified as 26.12%) with negligible hysteresis and outstanding operational stability, retaining 95% of initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous operation. This study offers a comprehensive molecular&#8208;level strategy to overcome intrinsic limitations of MeO&#8208;4PACz, providing a pathway for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Deep Depolymerization of Lignin via Reductive Acidolysis Yielding Copious Aromatics Thoroughly Revealed by NMR Chromatography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep depolymerization via reductive acidolysis of real lignins as well as a relatively large set of model compounds was achieved to a satisfactory level in a reaction medium consisted of [Bmim]I/organic acids, resulting in a conversion rate near completion for model compounds and a yield up to 81&#160;wt% of depolymerized products for real lignins.








Abstract
Depolymerization is the cornerstone of lignin valorization.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding Enabled Ambient&#8208;Driven Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Salmonella's ion&#8208;binding driven motion, a supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with dynamic coordination crosslinks enables a coordination motorized oscillator (CoMO) that harvests low&#8208;grade thermal energy. Reversible metal&#8208;ligand bonding converts molecular transitions into macroscopic oscillation, powering collective motion and adaptive soft robots (CoMbots).








Abstract
Harnessing ambient low&#8208;density energy and converting it into macroscopic motion is a hallmark of living systems. However, artificial systems are often limited by high energy requirements and intricate control mechanisms. Inspired by Salmonella, which uses dynamic ion&#8208;binding coordination for continuous motion, we proposed a novel concept of self&#8208;oscillating motors leveraging molecular&#8208;level dynamic bonding to harvest trivial ambient energy and power macroscopic, self&#8208;sustained behavior. Specifically, we developed a coordination motorized oscillator (CoMO) based on novel supramolecular PDMS material with 25&#8208;fold thermo&#8208;inflation ability of normal PDMS and nearly 2000&#8208;fold that of the passive layer. CoMO can harvest ambient energy as low as body temperature to reversibly dissociate coordination crosslinks, transforming molecular transitions into sustained macroscopic oscillation. Its universality facilitates the amplification of macroscopic motion via the collective behaviors of CoMOs. Moreover, this principle empowers the development of ambient&#8208;driven coordination motored robots (CoMbot) with multi&#8208;modal locomotion and adaptability across diverse terrains. Such dynamic chemical transitions enabled chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling for self&#8208;sustained systems, paving new avenues for robust transition&#8208;mechanical transducing material systems and soft machineries with unprecedented capabilities.

         <title>Minutes&#8208;Scale Ultrafast Synthesis of New Oxyhalides Solid Electrolytes with Interfacial Ionic Conduction for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oxyhalide solid electrolyte was synthesized in an ultrafast minutes&#8208;long process. Ta2O5, acting as a core&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;catalyst, drives the formation of a shell&#8208;like conductive amorphous oxyhalide, enabling an innovative interfacial conduction mechanism. Within this mechanism, bridging oxygen and non&#8208;bridging oxygen synergize with Ta&#9472;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Li coordination to optimize ion&#8208;transport pathways.








Abstract
Halide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) show exceptional promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet their dependence on prolonged ball milling to achieve required ionic conductivity critically compromises energy efficiency. Here, we report a novel Zr&#8208;based oxyhalide SSE (oh&#8208;LZC) synthesized via an ultrafast ball&#8208;milling process (18&#160;min)&#8212;a record for halide SSEs. Remarkably, extending processing to just 1.5&#160;h boosts ionic conductivity from 0.11 to 1.09&#160;mS cm&#8722;1&#8212;outperforming most reported Zr&#8208;based halides at equivalent synthesis durations. Critical to this advance is the strategic substitution of expensive Li2O with cost&#8208;effective Ta2O5 as the oxygen source&#8212;which simultaneously acts as a core&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;catalyst. During ultrafast milling, this drives formation of a shell&#8208;like conductive amorphous oxyhalide, directly enabling a novel interfacial conduction mechanism as confirmed by high&#8208;resolution microscopy and spectroscopy. ASSBs assembled with oh&#8208;LZC synthesized in 18&#160;min exhibit excellent compatibility with uncoated LiCoO2, delivering robust cycling stability (&gt;80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). Validated with alternative oxygen sources (Nb2O5), this pseudo&#8208;catalyst approach demonstrates versatility, pioneering accelerated synthesis protocols for halide SSEs and beyond.

         <title>Integrating the Substituent Effect into the Wade&#8211;Mingos Rules for Dicarboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new substituent&#8208;counting rule, P&#160;= nM + 1.1nH, incorporates substituent effects into the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules. By analyzing 74613 six&#8208;vertex dicarboranes, the trigonal&#8208;bipyrimidal isomer dominates at 89.1%, compared to the octagedron at 9.1%, providing a new platform for cluster design.








Abstract
This work revisits the Wade&#8211;Mingos (W&#8211;M) rules in carborane chemistry by showing that substituent effects, rather than skeletal electron pairs alone, determine ground&#8208;state architectures. We performed high&#8208;throughput computational analysis of 74613 six&#8208;vertex dicarboranes (C2B4R6), using the newly proposed Seed and Mortise&#8208;Tenon model, achieving a prediction accuracy of 92.8%. Through this analysis, we derived a simple substituent&#8208;counting rule (P&#160;= nM&#160;+ 1.1nH) that incorporates substituent electronegativity via connected&#8208;atom electronegativity (CAEN) to predict energetic stability. According to this rule, the previously underestimated trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal isomer emerges as the global ground state in 89.1% of the cases, whereas the W&#8211;M&#8208;predicted octahedral form accounts for only 9.1%. This inversion can be explained by electronic stabilization involving vacant orbitals of tricoordinate boron atoms. To rationalize these trends, we classified the studied carboranes into 28 domains defined by CAEN environments. Our analysis shows that substituent effects control the electronic balance between basic and acidic subfragments, a factor neglected in classical frameworks. The W&#8211;M rules fail in 27 of the 28 domains, remaining valid only for L&#8208;CAEN substituents (P&#160;=&#160;0). Collectively, these results establish a substituent&#8208;guided design framework and showcase how data&#8208;driven approaches can refine bonding rules in cluster chemistry.

Azasilabenzene: Gas&#8208;phase synthesis of a rare class of silicon&#8212;and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles via crossed molecular beam experiments and electronic structure calculations. Image shows the flux contour map for the reaction of silicon nitride radical with 1,3&#8208;butadiene under single&#8208;collision conditions, forming azasilabenzenes.








Abstract
Nature has long favored cyclic, particularly heterocyclic, molecules in the synthesis of key biomolecules. Silicon&#8208;substituted hydrocarbons have gained increasing attention due to their unique chemical bonding and electronic structure compared to their iso&#8208;valent carbon counterparts. However, the synthesis of silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic molecules remains a significant challenge. In this work, we investigate the reaction mechanism leading to a sparsely explored class of silicon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles, in which silicon and nitrogen atoms are positioned adjacently within an aromatic, six&#8208;membered ring: azasilabenzenes. This is achieved through the reaction of the silicon nitride (SiN) radical with 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) via single collision conditions, exploiting a crossed molecular beam experiment combined with electronic structure calculations and statistical analysis. Our results reveal the formation of two novel cyclic products: 1&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;silacyclohexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;dien&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;silabenzene. Interestingly, this reaction contrasts with the iso&#8208;valent system involving the cyano radical (CN) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6), which predominantly yields an acyclic product (1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene) via a simple addition&#8211;elimination pathway. In addition to elucidating the reaction pathways, this study also provides insights into the nature of bonding and atomic interactions in the resulting products, offering a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;stability relationships in silicon&#8211;nitrogen heterocycles and the counterintuitive concept of iso&#8208;valency.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature has long favored cyclic, particularly heterocyclic, molecules in the synthesis of key biomolecules. Silicon-substituted hydrocarbons have gained increasing attention due to their unique chemical bonding and electronic structure compared to their iso-valent carbon counterparts. However, the synthesis of silicon-containing heterocyclic molecules remains a significant challenge. In this work, we investigate the reaction mechanism leading to a sparsely explored class of silicon- and nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles, in which silicon and nitrogen atoms are positioned adjacently within an aromatic, six-membered ring: azasilabenzenes. This is achieved through the reaction of the silicon nitride (SiN) radical with 1,3-butadiene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) via single collision conditions, exploiting a crossed molecular beam experiment combined with electronic structure calculations and statistical analysis. Our results reveal the formation of two novel cyclic products: 1-aza-2-silacyclohexa-3,5-dien-2-ylidene and 1-aza-2-silabenzene. Interestingly, this reaction contrasts with the iso-valent system involving the cyano radical (CN) and 1,3-butadiene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which predominantly yields an acyclic product (1-cyano-1,3-butadiene) via a simple addition&#8211;elimination pathway. In addition to elucidating the reaction pathways, this study also provides insights into the nature of bonding and atomic interactions in the resulting products, offering a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;stability relationships in silicon&#8211;nitrogen heterocycles and the counterintuitive concept of iso-valency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Matched Symbiotic Noncovalent Sites Facilitated Supramolecular Nanotwists Featuring both P and M Sub&#8208;Helical Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to fabricate helical nanofibers featuring P and M sub&#8208;domains by symbiotic noncovalent sites. Two symbiotic sites (C&#8801;N, Ar&#9472;Hortho) in terminal cyanophenyl group can synergistically form noncovalent with different sites (C&#8801;N&#8943;Hmeta&#9472;Ar; Ar&#9472;Hortho&#8943;N&#8801;C), respectively facilitating the formation of M&#8208;type and P&#8208;type domains due to their opposite spatial direction. Moreover, these helical domains further cooperatively organize into higher&#8208;order P&#8208;nanofibers, providing a novel helical structure that can feature P and M sub&#8208;domains.








Abstract
Living system can use homochiral blocks to simultaneously fabricate diverse structures with opposite chirality (e.g., right&#8208;handed &#945;&#8208;helices and left&#8208;handed polyproline&#8208;II helices) for maintaining three&#8208;dimensional conformations and functions of biostructures, but realizing this process in artificial systems remains exceptional challenge due to difficulty in constructing precise noncovalent pattern for diverse chirality transfer. Herein, we report a strategy to fabricate helical nanofibers featuring P and M sub&#8208;domains by delicately introducing symbiotic noncovalent sites in the terminal of l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives (LCN). Benefiting from the conformation match of LCN, two symbiotic sites (C&#8801;N, Ar&#9472;Hortho) in terminal cyanophenyl group can synergistically form noncovalent with different sites (C&#8801;N&#8943;Hmeta&#9472;Ar; Ar&#9472;Hortho&#8943;N&#8801;C), resulting in a precise noncovalent network. Furthermore, these two noncovalent facilitate the simultaneous formation of M&#8208;type and P&#8208;type domains due to their opposite spatial direction. Similar phenomenon is also observed from symbiotic sites in another terminal hydroxy group (O, H), further confirming an unusual chirality transfer where molecular homochirality propagates to supramolecular domains with opposite handedness. Besides, these helical domains can further cooperatively organize into higher&#8208;order P&#8208;type helices, in which fiber longitudinal axes aligns with the screw axes of noncovalent&#8208;defined helices. This study accelerates the understanding of diverse chirality transfer based on homochirality in nature and takes into a realm of constructing helical nanostructures with diverse sub&#8208;helices by homochiral blocks.

         <title>Beyond Local Coordination: How Global Structure Engineers the Selectivity of Single Atom Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite identical CoN4 active sites, carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit different CO2 reduction selectivity. The global structure governs interfacial charge distribution and water orientation, thereby controlling reaction selectivity beyond local coordination.








Abstract
The local structure of the active center is generally believed to determine the catalytic performance, but this rule fails in many situations. One of the representative cases is carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), where Ndoped carbon (NC) and phthalocyanine (Pc) substrates usually endow the same active center (MN4) with different performance. Herein, we unveiled an intrinsic global&#8211;local interplay mechanism, in which global structural engineering, coupled with local&#8208;site sensitivity, determines the catalytic performance of SACs. Specifically, the similar local active sites yield comparable d&#8208;band centers and reaction thermodynamics, while the distinct global structures induce markedly different potentials of zero charge (PZC). This disparity leads to the varying electron accommodation capacity and interfacial water orientation, altering the reaction energetics. Moreover, the degree of this global effect critically depends on the sensitivity of the local charge of the active site to the global structural variation. As a result, Co SACs, with greater sensitivity than Fe and Ni SACs, exhibit completely opposite selectivity between CoNC and CoPc. Our work transcends the conventional local&#8208;site paradigm and highlights the important role of global structure, in concert with local sensitivity, in governing catalytic performance.

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence and Solar Thermal Energy Storage in Norbornadiene&#8211;Quadricyclane Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichromophoric donor&#8211;acceptor norbornadiene switches exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, tunable photoisomerisation and fluorescence, and record solar energy storage performance. Ortho&#8208;dimers act as efficient photoswitches, whilst para&#8208;dimers are highly emissive. Solvent choice further tunes quantum yields, and a device efficiency of 2.9% with measurable heat release highlights their potential for MOST. 








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair is a promising system for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. Multichromophoric systems with two or more photoswitches can offer red&#8208;shifted absorption, higher energy densities, and additional functionality. Here, a series of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted NBD dimers bearing methoxy, hexoxy (for solubility), and cyano groups were synthesised and evaluated for their MOST properties. Compared to monomers, the dimers display red&#8208;shifted absorption and improved solar spectrum match, with onsets between 448&#8211;488&#160;nm, owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor design and extended conjugation. A key finding is the tunable relationship between molecular structure, photoluminescence and photoisomerisation: para&#8208;dimers exhibit efficient fluorescence, whilst ortho&#8208;dimers are superior photoswitches with quantum yields of isomerisation, &#934;i, up to 63%. Solvent choice further modulates behaviour; &#934;i is higher in acetonitrile, whereas fluorescence is more efficient in toluene. This interplay allows tailoring for specific functions. The best&#8208;performing photoswitches were studied in a liquid&#8208;chip device, achieving a record solar conversion efficiency of 2.9%. Catalytic back&#8208;conversion using cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon and macroscopic heat release experiments at 0.1&#160;M yielded a 5.78&#160;&#176;C temperature increase. This first experimental macroscopic heat release of a dimeric system provides important insights into design challenges and opportunities for advancing multichromophoric systems towards MOST applications.

         <title>Switching the Reaction Pathway to the Oxide Path for High&#8208;Efficiency Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking how 1D edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedra chains in model catalyst Ca2IrO4 drive adaptive coordination reconstruction, triggering a mechanistic transition from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). This transition stems from CV activation&#8208;induced edge&#8208;sharing reconstruction on the (001) surface, which achieves shortening of Ir&#9472;Ir bonds.








Abstract
Understanding dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationships in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains challenging due to electrocatalysts&#8217; structural complexity. Here, we employ Ca2IrO4&#8212;a model catalyst with exclusively edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedra forming 1D chains&#8212;to decode mechanistic evolution through synergistic interplay between corrosion&#8208;resistant (110) and electrochemically activable (001) facets. With low (110) and (001) facet ratios, Ca2IrO4 (L&#8208;H&#8208;CIO) undergoes electrochemical activation to form an adaptively reconstructed structure, ultimately achieving exceptional OER performance&#8212;demonstrating a low overpotential of 279&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 200&#8208;h stability without decay. The L&#8208;H&#8208;CIO&#8208;based PEMWE exhibits high electrocatalytic activity (1.78&#160;V @ 2.0 A cm&#8722;2, 80&#160;&#176;C, 0.11 mgIr cm&#8722;2) at ampere&#8208;level current densities while demonstrating sustained stability beyond 500&#160;h at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that adaptive surface reconstruction drives a mechanistic transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide path mechanism (OPM).

&lt;p&gt;Unlocking how 1D edge-sharing IrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra chains in model catalyst Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; drive adaptive coordination reconstruction, triggering a mechanistic transition from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). This transition stems from CV activation-induced edge-sharing reconstruction on the (001) surface, which achieves shortening of Ir&#9472;Ir bonds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationships in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains challenging due to electrocatalysts&#8217; structural complexity. Here, we employ Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8212;a model catalyst with exclusively edge-sharing IrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra forming 1D chains&#8212;to decode mechanistic evolution through synergistic interplay between corrosion-resistant (110) and electrochemically activable (001) facets. With low (110) and (001) facet ratios, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (L-H-CIO) undergoes electrochemical activation to form an adaptively reconstructed structure, ultimately achieving exceptional OER performance&#8212;demonstrating a low overpotential of 279&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 200-h stability without decay. The L-H-CIO-based PEMWE exhibits high electrocatalytic activity (1.78&#160;V @ 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 80&#160;&#176;C, 0.11 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at ampere-level current densities while demonstrating sustained stability beyond 500&#160;h at 1.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that adaptive surface reconstruction drives a mechanistic transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide path mechanism (OPM). This shift is structurally anchored by edge-sharing IrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra reconstruction (Ir&#8211;Ir 2.8&#160;&#197;) of the (001) surface, which simultaneously downshifts the Ir d-band center away from the Fermi level. The resultant weakened metal-intermediate covalency optimizes the adsorption&#8211;desorption equilibrium, conferring thermodynamic and kinetic advantages to OPM. Our work establishes adaptive coordination reconstruction as a universal strategy to engineer pre-catalysts that evolve into high-efficiency OER phases, providing a roadmap for next-generation catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Single Electron Transfer Enables General Visible Light C&#9472;X (S, SS, Se) Coupling via Carbonyl Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by Marcus theory, we developed a redox&#8208;pair screening strategy that identified optimal triplet&#8208;state pathways. This revealed an ultrafast single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process near the diffusion limit, enabling a novel dual&#8208;functionalization of &#945;&#8208;diketones for efficient C&#9472;X (X&#160;=&#160;SS, S, Se) bond formation under mild, redox&#8208;neutral conditions, showcasing both mechanistic innovation and synthetic utility.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;heteroatom bonds is a key strategy that enables the modular construction of molecules in synthetic chemistry, but activating inert carbonyl compounds to forge C&#9472;X bonds remains a longstanding synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a universal visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic system that enables efficient C&#9472;X (X&#160;=&#160;SS, S, Se) bond formation under mild, redox&#8211;neutral conditions. Guided by Marcus electron transfer theory, we employed a computational redox&#8208;pair screening strategy to identify triplet&#8208;state pathways with optimal electronic coupling matrix element (Hif) and thermodynamic alignment. High&#8208;level multireference calculations confirmed an ultrafast single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism with ultrafast kinetics approaching the diffusion limit. To translate this mechanistic insight into a functional platform, we designed a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy for &#945;&#8208;diketones, wherein one carbonyl acts as a conventional synthon while the other forms a light&#8208;responsive dihydroquinazolinone (DHQZ) radical precursor. This system exhibits broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and compatibility with late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive scaffolds. Overall, this study establishes a general and mechanistically predictive photocatalytic strategy that transforms Marcus theory from a conceptual foundation into a design principle for efficient, light&#8208;driven C&#9472;heteroatom bond construction.

         <title>Aminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling: Tackling Alkyl Nucleophiles and Addressing the Viability of the Electrophile&#8208;First Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed aminative coupling of primary and secondary alkyl boronic esters with aryl (pseudo)halides is reported. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments show that the first C&#9472;N bond formation may take place through an unusual dyotropic rearrangement of a LPd(Ar)NHX complex (X&#160;=&#160;OPOPh2).








Abstract
Insertive cross&#8208;coupling reactions provide the option of repurposing widely available coupling partners for the formation of new linkages. By confronting a major limitation of the aminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura methods we recently reported, we achieve a general method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aminative coupling of primary and secondary alkyl boronic esters with aryl (pseudo)halides. Introducing a formal nitrene insertion into this Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction diverts the outcome from the traditional C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) products to the C(sp2)&#9472;NH&#9472;C(sp3) analogues (N&#8208;aryl anilines). DFT calculations and experimental mechanistic studies indicate that C&#9472;N bond formation from the electrophilic aryl component occurs first, providing further evidence for this previously hypothetical pathway. By comparison of several transition state structures, we find that C&#9472;N bond formation likely takes place through an unusual dyotropic rearrangement of a LPd(Ar)NHX complex (X&#160;=&#160;OPOPh2).

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Generated Electric Fields and Ligand Non&#8208;Innocence Drive the Record&#8208;High Efficiency of Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin Catalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>

A unified design strategy for Fe&#8211;porphyrin electrocatalysts is developed by identifying local electric fields and ligand redox non&#8208;innocence as the principal drivers of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. This work uncovers how strategic charge placement tunes catalytic performance, offering a predictive framework for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is a critical step in sustainable catalysis, with iron&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8211;TPP) derivatives recognised as benchmark catalysts, reaching turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 106 s&#8722;1 with trimethylammonium (TMA) substitution. However, substituent effects remain unpredictable: sulfonyl groups render the catalyst inactive, while others enhance activity, yielding over 50 analogues without coherent design principle. Using density functional theory (DFT) and response theory (including electric field effects), we identify factors governing this variability. Electronic structure analysis reveals the redox non&#8208;innocent behaviour of TPP ligand, forming [Fe(II)TPP&#8226;&#8226;]2&#8722; species, stabilised by antiferromagnetic coupling (J = &#8722;656 cm&#8722;1). The ligand's ability to transiently hold and transfer electrons during the catalytic cycle enhances catalytic performance. Energetic&#8208;span model analysis for Fe&#8211;TPP&#160;(1), Fe&#8211;p&#8208;TMA (2), and Fe&#8211;o&#8208;TMA (3) yields barriers of 195.5, 184.4, and 162.2&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, matching experiments 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1. Crucially, local electric fields (LEFs), arising from charged substituents dominate reactivity, surpassing traditional steric or inductive considerations. Applying an oriented electric field of&#160;+&#160;0.21&#160;V &#197;&#8722;1 to 1 reproduces the performance of 3, confirming LEF as a unifying descriptor. Guided by this, we in silico design next&#8208;generation catalysts, setting a new paradigm in CO2 reduction catalysis.

Extreme&#8208;Temperature and Fast&#8208;Charging LFP/graphite Batteries: A sterically hindered weak&#8208;solvation ether electrolyte suppresses graphite co&#8208;intercalation and accelerates Li&#8314; desolvation via ultralow freezing point (&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C) and tailored solvation structure. Engineered LiF/Li3N/Li2O/Li2CO3&#8208;rich interphases enable rapid interfacial transport and extreme&#8208;temperature resilience.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes are extensively utilized for energy storage applications because of their exceptional cycle life and inherent safety characteristics. However, sluggish desolvation kinetics and interfacial Li&#8314; transport hinder their fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance, limiting broader applications. In this work, we propose a weakly solvating ether (WSE) electrolyte based on 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (2MT) as the main solvent. This electrolyte results in considerable steric hindrance, effectively preventing co&#8208;intercalation with Gr, while also providing a weak solvation capability for Li&#8314; ions and facilitating rapid interfacial Li&#8314; transport. WSE, formulated with 2MT and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as a co&#8208;solvent, combines fast desolvation kinetics with an extremely low freezing point of&#160;&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C. This electrolyte induces the formation of a LiF&#8208;, Li3N&#8208;, Li2CO3&#8208;, and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Gr anode, thereby enhancing low&#8208;temperature interfacial transport.

&lt;p&gt;Extreme-Temperature and Fast-Charging LFP/graphite Batteries: A sterically hindered weak-solvation ether electrolyte suppresses graphite co-intercalation and accelerates Li&#8314; desolvation via ultralow freezing point (&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C) and tailored solvation structure. Engineered LiF/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-rich interphases enable rapid interfacial transport and extreme-temperature resilience.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) employing lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, LFP) cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes are extensively utilized for energy storage applications because of their exceptional cycle life and inherent safety characteristics. However, sluggish desolvation kinetics and interfacial Li&#8314; transport hinder their fast-charging capability and low-temperature performance, limiting broader applications. In this work, we propose a weakly solvating ether (WSE) electrolyte based on 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2MT) as the main solvent. This electrolyte results in considerable steric hindrance, effectively preventing co-intercalation with Gr, while also providing a weak solvation capability for Li&#8314; ions and facilitating rapid interfacial Li&#8314; transport. WSE, formulated with 2MT and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as a co-solvent, combines fast desolvation kinetics with an extremely low freezing point of&#160;&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C. This electrolyte induces the formation of a LiF-, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-, and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Gr anode, thereby enhancing low-temperature interfacial transport. Consequently, the Gr||Li half-cell and the LFP||Gr full cell with this WSE demonstrates excellent rate performance, stable cycling stability, and a high specific capacity at&#160;&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C while also delivering reliable power even at&#160;&#8722;60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Atomistic Landscape of Pt Nanoparticles via Machine Learning: How Size Effect and Hydrogen Adsorption Govern Structural Ensembles and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature and structure of Pt nanoparticles under a pressure of hydrogen is studied using machine learning potential guided grand&#8208;canonical global optimization, generating more than one million stable and metastable PtxHy structure candidates for analysis. A noncrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation of Pt configurations is revealed at the atomic level, driven by the adsorption of hydrogen or the increased size of the nanoparticle. 








Abstract
Understanding the atomistic structure and fluxionality of Pt nanoparticles under reactive conditions is essential for rational design of effective catalysts, yet their structural complexity presents a great challenge. In this work, we combine grand canonical global optimization methods and machine learning potentials to explore the atomistic landscape of nanometer&#8208;sized (1&#8764;2&#160;nm) Pt nanoparticles under a pressure of hydrogen, resulting in a comprehensive library of PtxHy nanoparticles with over one million low&#8208;energy metastable structures. We found that hydrogen adsorption drives a size&#8208;dependent transformation from an amorphous to a crystalline structure, leading to sharp phase transitions for smaller nanoparticles and smooth transformations for larger ones. This behavior is governed by a competition between distinct core configurations, as well as the formation of rigid and fluxional local domains, where stability is dictated by specific surface motifs at low H coverage and by the crystalline core at high H coverage. By applying this structural library for reactivity modeling of methane dehydrogenation and ethylene hydrogenation, we show a marked discrepancy between the abundance of a surface site and its catalytic contribution, indicating that the active sites are rare, structurally distinct motifs, not the most common sites.

         <title>Miniature Photoenzyme Enables Organelle&#8208;Specific Cellular Control via Deboronative Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically encoded miniature photoenzyme miniSOG (12 kDa) enables&#160;spatiotemporally controlled bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation of 27 diverse organoboronates in live cells&#160;via localized superoxide radical anion O2&#8226;&#8722; generation.








Abstract
Artificial photoenzymes hold transformative potential for in vitro biocatalysis, but their translation to live&#8208;cell environments demands minimal cellular perturbation and aerobic compatibility. Here, we present miniSOG, a 12&#160;kDa miniature photoenzyme that enables bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation via superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation under blue light irradiation. Leveraging the inherent photochemistry of flavins, miniSOG facilitates the photoactivation of 27 structurally diverse organoboronates&#8212;including aryl/alkyl boronates, fluorophores, anticancer agents, and epigenetic modulators&#8212;through a unified O2&#8226;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism. This system achieves spatiotemporally precise photocatalysis in live cells, where miniSOG's compact size and subcellular targeting enable organelle&#8208;specific localization and confined reactivity due to short&#8208;range O2&#8226;&#8722; diffusion (&#8764;0.2&#160;&#181;m). We demonstrate its utility in light&#8208;gated cellular modulation: i) mitochondrial depolarization via localized release of 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (DNP) to disrupt energy metabolism, and ii) nuclear m6A methylation enhancement to epigenetically upregulate autophagy. By repurposing miniSOG's photochemistry for bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation, this work establishes a versatile, genetically encoded platform for manipulating fundamental cellular pathways with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Surface Vacancy Engineering Re&#8208;Routes First&#8208;Cycle Redox for Stabilized Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical treatment creates anionic/cationic vacancies and atomic displacements. During the first cycle charge, these vacancies triggered early reversible O oxidation, at the expense of suppressed Ni oxidation, preventing brutal lattice collapse. This prevented further Mn dissolution during discharge and improved Coulombic efficiency (CE). By re&#8208;routing the first&#8208;cycle redox process, the long&#8208;term cycle was improved with stabilized Ni and O redox over 50 cycles. 








Abstract
We demonstrate that atomic&#8208;scale surface disorder can control the first&#8208;cycle redox sequence of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides, eliminating the detrimental process of oxygen release and lattice collapse that degrades performance. In Li1.14Ni0.32Mn0.54O2 (LNMO), a simple chemical treatment introduces oxygen and transition metal (TM) vacancies confined to the particle surface while preserving the bulk layered framework. Multi&#8208;modal synchrotron analyses reveal that these vacancies trigger an early oxygen oxidation below 4.4&#8201;V, delay nickel oxidation to higher potential, and suppress the formation of covalent Ni4+&#9472;O states. This modified pathway prevents irreversible oxygen release, suppresses manganese dissolution, and maintains metal&#8208;oxygen coordination at high voltages. Consequently, the treated cathode delivers higher first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE), mitigated voltage fade, and superior capacity retention. By directly linking engineered surface disorder to redox reactions and associated structural transformations, this work establishes a general design principle for durable, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Bipyridine&#8208;Anchored Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction Across a Broad pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated approach, combining theoretical screening and precise synthesis, is presented for the design of bipyridine&#8208;anchored Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia across a broad pH range, spanning acidic to alkaline conditions. The exceptional performance of these bipyridine&#8208;Cu sites in the NO3RR is attributed to their enhanced interfacial water dissociation and efficient hydrogenation capabilities, which facilitate the selective conversion of NOx intermediates to ammonia.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia represents an efficient approach to alleviate nitrate pollution, concurrently providing a sustainable strategy for ammonia synthesis. The development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts that exhibit both high activity and selectivity in nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) constitutes a substantial challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the NO3RR through theoretical screening and precise synthesis techniques. A series of bipyridine&#8208;anchored 3d transition metal SACs has been computationally pre&#8208;evaluated for their NO3RR activity and selectivity, and bipyridine&#8208;Cu SAC stands out as the optimal candidate. Guided by the computational predictions, the bipyridine&#8208;Cu encapsulated inside a zirconium&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (namely Cu&#8208;SA/UiO&#8208;bpy) is synthesized and achieves an impressive ammonia yield rate of 7.4 mgNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a faradaic efficiency of 98.1% in NO3RR under neutral conditions. Additionally, Cu&#8208;SA/UiO&#8208;bpy exhibits remarkable catalytic performance (FE&#160;&gt;&#160;90%) across a wide pH range. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations further reveal that bipyridine&#8208;Cu sites facilitate the interfacial dissociation of water and the efficient generation of reactive hydrogen species, enabling the selective hydrogenation of NOx intermediates into ammonia. This integration of a data&#8208;driven approach with precise synthesis presents a novel paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts toward NO3RR and other catalytic applications.

Guided by the computational predictions, the bipyridine-Cu encapsulated inside a zirconium-containing metal&#8211;organic framework (namely Cu-SA/UiO-bpy) is synthesized and achieves an impressive ammonia yield rate of 7.4 mg&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a faradaic efficiency of 98.1% in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR under neutral conditions. Additionally, Cu-SA/UiO-bpy exhibits remarkable catalytic performance (FE&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;90%) across a wide pH range. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations further reveal that bipyridine-Cu sites facilitate the interfacial dissociation of water and the efficient generation of reactive hydrogen species, enabling the selective hydrogenation of NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; intermediates into ammonia. This integration of a data-driven approach with precise synthesis presents a novel paradigm for developing high-performance catalysts toward NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR and other catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Peptide and Protein Functionalization with Cyclopropenium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation using aromatic cyclopropenium cations is reported. The reaction proceeds rapidly under aqueous conditions, enabling site&#8208;selective installation of tetrasubstituted cyclopropene rings on peptides and proteins. The method shows preference for internal cysteines and provides conjugates that serve as efficient radical traps in thiol&#8211;ene chemistry, forming stable cyclopropane&#8208;linked products.








Abstract
In the realm of organic chemistry, carbocations play a pivotal role as highly reactive intermediates in the synthesis of complex molecules. While cyclase enzymes construct terpenoid natural products through carbocation intermediates, the use of these electrophilic reactive species for peptide and protein bioconjugation in aqueous media remains unexplored. Herein, we disclose the discovery and development of a new chemical modification of peptides and proteins with aromatic cyclopropenium cations, selective at cysteine residues. The bioconjugation is fast, operationally simple, and occurs at low concentration in aqueous media, allowing for the installation of a tetrasubstituted cyclopropene ring with excellent site selectivity. Moreover, the cyclopropenylation is preferential to internal cysteines, thus complementing current methodologies for selective terminal cysteine bioconjugation. These studies further showcased the bioconjugates' utility as radical traps in a thiol&#8211;ene process, enabling the formation of cyclopropane&#8208;linked conjugates.

         <title>Colloidal Phase Control in Plasmonic Metal Oxide Nanocrystals via Competitive Metal&#8211;Ligand Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieve programmable gelation temperature and network structure in terpyridine&#8208;functionalized tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystals. This strategy leverages the tuning of competitive metal&#8211;terpyridine and metal&#8211;halide equilibria via metal and halide identity, concentration, and temperature, enabling broad&#8208;range infrared optical modulation.








Abstract
Colloidal nanocrystal gels offer tunable optical properties governed by both the nature of the building blocks and their spatial arrangement. When assembled via reversible molecular linkers, their phase behavior and structure are primarily dictated by bond strength and lability. However, precise control over these interactions remains a significant synthetic challenge and is often system&#8208;specific. Here, we present a simple, broadly tunable linking strategy that modulates nanocrystal phase behavior and assembly structure by leveraging competitive metal&#8211;ligand equilibria. We achieve programmable control over gelation temperature and network structure by tuning competitive metal&#8211;terpyridine and metal&#8211;halide equilibria in terpyridine&#8208;functionalized tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals, governed by metal and halide identity, concentration, and temperature, enabling wide&#8208;range infrared optical modulation. Combined kinetic Monte Carlo and optical simulations reveal that weaker, more labile links facilitate particle crawling, leading to denser gel structures with enhanced plasmon coupling. This strategy eliminates the need for complex ligand or linker design and establishes competitive coordination chemistry as a versatile platform for engineering dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive colloidal&#160;assemblies.

         <title>Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Cation Cascade Boosting Ion Intercalation Dynamics in Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries exhibit remarkable performance under illumination. However, a fundamental mechanistic gap persists in understanding light&#8208;enhanced battery performance, as existing theories fail to explain the complex interplay between photoexcitation and ion intercalation dynamics. Here, photoinduced proton&#8208;cation cascade reveals the link between photoexcitation and cation intercalation kinetics in atomic&#8208;scale.








Abstract
While photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries represent a promising energy storage frontier&#8212;with light irradiation significantly improving performance&#8212;their development remains hindered by a fundamental knowledge gap, as existing theories struggle to fully account for improved light&#8208;driven ion intercalation. This work discovers the photoinduced proton&#8208;zinc ion intercalation cascade mechanism, establishing a theoretical framework that explains the synergistic proton&#8208;cation interplay and its role in capacity enhancement under illumination. Through light&#8208;induced charge transfer, photogenerated electrons drive proton intercalation, which induces the deprotonation of Zn2+&#8208;coordinated water molecules due to the limited availability of free protons in the electrolyte. This deprotonation is energetically favored because of the lower deprotonation barrier of Zn2+&#8208;coordinated water compared to uncoordinated water, thereby accelerating zinc&#8208;ion desolvation and promoting Zn2+ intercalation. Consequently, the synergistic H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;intercalation enables an exceptional areal capacity of 12.86&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 under illumination in a photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;ion battery with a high mass&#8208;loading of 30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work elucidates a proton&#8208;cation cascade mechanism that governs light&#8208;driven intercalation dynamics, providing the missing link between photo&#8208;excitation and enhanced battery performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Theoretical Screening of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput screening accelerates the discovery of efficient MN4C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for urea synthesis. A volcano relationship between *N adsorption and activity is identified, and the *NO3&#160;&#8594;&#160;*N conversion limiting potential emerges as a key descriptor for catalyst evaluation.








Abstract
Electrochemical urea synthesis offers a promising approach for sustainable nitrogen and carbon utilization, yet its progress is hindered by the unclear reaction mechanism and the lack of effective catalyst design principles. Here, we conduct a high&#8208;throughput screening of over 40 MN4C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to identify promising candidates for electrochemical urea synthesis. This strategy improves screening efficiency by 94.8% compared to conventional methods. Our analysis demonstrates that Ti&#9472;, V&#9472;, Nb&#9472;, Mo&#9472;, and Hf&#8211;N4C catalysts concurrently fulfill the essential criteria, including thermodynamic stability, favorable adsorption of small molecules, suppression of competing reactions, and low energy barriers for both hydrogenation and C&#8211;N coupling. Mechanistic investigations reveal two distinct C&#8211;N coupling pathways and demonstrate that hydrogenation of *N species is a prerequisite for subsequent coupling. Notably, we reveal a linear correlation between the limiting potentials of NO3&#8722; reduction and overall urea synthesis, establishing *NO3&#160;&#8594;&#160;*N activity as a reliable descriptor for catalyst screening. This work provides mechanistic insights and a predictive framework for the rational design of efficient urea electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tailoring &#960;--d$\pi {\text{--}}d$ Magnetic Interactions in Metallated Porphyrin Nanotapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand how &#960;$\pi$&#8208;radicals and d$d$&#8208;electrons interact within molecular nanostructures, we have studied metallated porphyrin nanotapes synthesized on gold surfaces. We reveal element&#8208;specific results: with Fe centers the ferromagnetic &#960;$\pi$&#8208;d$d$ exchange dominates, while with Co centers the metal&#8211;metal exchange overpowers the &#960;$\pi$&#8208;d$d$ exchange, with Kondo&#8208;screened ligand spins, highlighting porphyrin nanotapes as a versatile platform for designer 1D magnetism.








Abstract
Molecular assemblies based on porphyrins (Pors), specifically Por nanotapes (NTs) containing magnetic metal ions, offer a versatile platform to explore magnetic interactions arising from the electronic interplay between &#960;$\pi$&#8208;conjugated ligands and transition metal d&#8208;orbitals. Using on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we synthesized &#960;$\pi$&#8208;extended PorNTs of different lengths incorporating magnetic metal ions such as Fe and Co on Au(111). We resolved their atomic structure using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Differential conductance (dI/dV${\rm d}I/{\rm d}V$) measurements, interpreted by extensive density functional theory calculations and theoretical modeling, reveal two distinct magnetic behaviors for the Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;based systems. In FePorNTs, the magnetic interactions are dominated by strong Fe&#8211;ligand ferromagnetic coupling and weak antiferromagnetic Fe&#8211;Fe coupling. By contrast, CoPorNTs exhibit stronger Co&#8211;Co antiferromagnetic exchange and weaker Co&#8211;ligand coupling, with Kondo screening evident at the ligand sites. Our findings underscore the profound influence of metal centers, ligands, and substrate interactions on the magnetic and electronic properties of PorNTs, establishing these assemblies as interesting building blocks for low&#8208;dimensional magnetism and future spintronic or quantum&#8208;material&#160;applications.

&lt;p&gt;To understand how &#960;$\pi$-radicals and d$d$-electrons interact within molecular nanostructures, we have studied metallated porphyrin nanotapes synthesized on gold surfaces. We reveal element-specific results: with Fe centers the ferromagnetic &#960;$\pi$-d$d$ exchange dominates, while with Co centers the metal&#8211;metal exchange overpowers the &#960;$\pi$-d$d$ exchange, with Kondo-screened ligand spins, highlighting porphyrin nanotapes as a versatile platform for designer 1D magnetism.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular assemblies based on porphyrins (Pors), specifically Por nanotapes (NTs) containing magnetic metal ions, offer a versatile platform to explore magnetic interactions arising from the electronic interplay between &#960;$\pi$-conjugated ligands and transition metal &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals. Using on-surface synthesis under ultra-high vacuum, we synthesized &#960;$\pi$-extended PorNTs of different lengths incorporating magnetic metal ions such as Fe and Co on Au(111). We resolved their atomic structure using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). Differential conductance (dI/dV${\rm d}I/{\rm d}V$) measurements, interpreted by extensive density functional theory calculations and theoretical modeling, reveal two distinct magnetic behaviors for the Fe- and Co-based systems. In FePorNTs, the magnetic interactions are dominated by strong Fe&#8211;ligand ferromagnetic coupling and weak antiferromagnetic Fe&#8211;Fe coupling. By contrast, CoPorNTs exhibit stronger Co&#8211;Co antiferromagnetic exchange and weaker Co&#8211;ligand coupling, with Kondo screening evident at the ligand sites.

         <title>Decarboxylative Arene Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biodegradation pathway of benzoic acid, a novel decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening strategy with a tailored nitrogenation reagent has been developed, which enables efficient arene ring cleavage. This process unlocks new synthetic pathways for challenging aromatic C&#9472;C bond cleavage reactions and demonstrates practical applicability in late&#8208;stage functionalization and molecular diversification strategies.








Abstract
Benzoic acids are widely utilized in synthetic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and materials science, yet their potential as precursors for linear synthons is severely constrained by the challenge of cleaving their highly stable aromatic C&#9472;C bonds. Here, we report that a PDPP (4&#8208;(piperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) and copper synergistically catalyzed nitrogenation of benzoic acids with a tailored nitrogenation reagent. This protocol efficiently enables the selective decarboxylation and benzene ring opening processes leading to acyclic dinitrile products. The designed new azide reagent plays an essential role in the PDPP&#8208;catalyzed initial step to trigger the selective carboxyl and aromatic C&#9472;C bond cleavage process. This synergistic strategy greatly expands the synthetic utility of benzoic acids, providing a direct and practical route to acyclic scaffolds. The aromatic ring&#8208;opening products could be further used in cyclization reactions to realize phenyl ring scaffold hopping.

         <title>Thermally Activated Stereoinversion in Benzotrithiophene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers with Water as the Effector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral benzotrithiophene derivative 1 self&#8208;assembles into helical supramolecular polymers whose helicity changes with water content. High water content induces a reversible double stereomutation, while low water content yields a single, stable one. Computational studies show two monomer conformations leading to opposite helices. Water facilitates transitions via triple hydrogen bonding, revealing its key role in modulating chiral polymer structure. 








Abstract
We report the synthesis of the chiral benzotrithiophene (BTT) derivative 1, which self&#8208;assembles into helical supramolecular polymers. The C3 symmetry of BTT 1 enables a unique temperature&#8208;dependent stereomutation process in which water acts as a key effector. Circular dichroism measurements reveal that a higher water content induces a double stereomutation, ultimately restoring the original helicity. In contrast, reducing the water content leads to a single, stable stereomutation, which duration depends on the amount of water in solution. To elucidate the stereomutation mechanism, we conducted a multi&#8208;level computational study, identifying two main conformations for the monomeric species that lead to diastereomeric helices with different preferred handedness, thus resulting in opposite dichroic patterns. The transition between these aggregates involves rotation of the BTT cores and amide groups, a process significantly facilitated by water molecules via triple hydrogen bonding within the helical stack. These findings exhibit the crucial role of the solvent in modulating chiral supramolecular polymer structures and provide unprecedented insights into the influence of water on self&#8208;assembly and stereomutation processes.

         <title>Cationic&#8208;Catalyst Strategy Enabling Ultrafast and Controlled Polymerization and Efficient Depolymerization Toward a Circular Polymer Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy for ultrafast and controlled synthesis of amino acid (AA) polymers, as well as efficient depolymerization towards a circular polymer economy. The cationic catalyst facilitates efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids under mild condition, with the catalyst itself being recyclable, achieving a dual closed&#8208;loop recycling system for AA polymers and cationic catalyst. 








Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers is considered one of the ideal solutions to alleviate the growing polymer waste. Fast, controlled synthesis and closed&#8208;loop recycling of amino acid (AA) polymers, as an important class of polyamides, are highly important for applications and circular polymer economy. Strong base&#8208;initiated N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) polymerization can prepare AA polymers very quickly, however, has the long&#8208;standing challenge of poor molecular weight controllability and numerous side reactions. Herein, we develop a highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy that enables both &#8220;ultrafast, controlled AA polymer synthesis&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8208;loop AA polymer recycling&#8221;. This robust and easily scalable cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy is compatible with various organic strong bases as initiators, and enables the synthesis of molecular weight well&#8208;controlled AA polymers on a hectogram scale (&#8764;120&#160;g) within minutes. Moreover, the cationic catalyst facilitates the efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids, with a recovery rate of 85.9%. In addition, the catalyst itself can be recycled quantitatively. In short, the highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy implies practical and promising applications in polymerization and depolymerization chemistry, demonstrating great potential for the circular polymer economy and sustainable management of polymer waste.

         <title>Atroposelective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C&#8211;H Olefination of BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H olefination and desymmetrization strategy has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of axially chiral BODIPYs with exceptional stereocontrol and broad functional group tolerance.








Abstract
Enantioenriched BODIPYs have emerged as a class of exceptionally valuable fluorophores, distinguished by their remarkable chiroptical properties and versatile applications in bioimaging, molecular sensing, and optoelectronic materials. The development of asymmetric catalytic methodologies for their synthesis represents a significant advancement in this field. Herein, we present a robust and efficient strategy for the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H olefination and desymmetrization at the &#947;&#8208;position of BODIPYs, facilitated by a thioether directing group and a chiral amino acid&#8208;derived ligand. This oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction enables the direct synthesis of a wide array of axially chiral BODIPY derivatives with exceptional E&#8208;selectivity and outstanding enantioselectivities. The resultant chiral fluorophores exhibit tunable photophysical properties, including near&#8208;infrared emission and robust circularly polarized luminescence, and demonstrate excellent biocompatibility in live&#8208;cell imaging. This method establishes a comprehensive platform for the streamlined synthesis of axially chiral BODIPYs, thereby advancing their potential applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic, biological, and optoelectronic technologies.

A photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of nonactivated alkenes with simple amines, through Co(III)H&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer followed by a nucleophilic amination of alkylcobalt(IV), was developed, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in high yields and enantioselectivities. 








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed direct enantioselective addition of N&#9472;H bonds to unactivated alkenes is of great significance as it creates high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral alkylamines from two abundant chemical feedstocks, yet it has long been a considerable challenge. Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements rely on the use of olefins with a tethered heteroatom or heteroaromatic amine, which can readily coordinate with metal catalysts to achieve high stereoselectivity. Herein, we report a photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of nonactivated alkenes with simple amines through Co(III)H&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer followed by a nucleophilic amination of alkylcobalt(IV), enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in high yields and enantioselectivities. The strategy demonstrates a unique capability to control enantioselectivity of the in situ generated alkyl radicals, efficiently differentiating two alkyl substituents (methyl versus methylene), which is significantly less explored in enantioselective radical transformation. This research will spark new ideas for the asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with various nucleophiles.

         <title>Photoactivatable Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional photoswitches undergo reversible transitions between two thermodynamically stable states upon irradiation at two distinct wavelengths. A hydrazone&#8208;photoswitch precursor is now introduced that can be converted in situ to an active photoswitch upon photoirradiation. The photoactivation and photoisomerization pathways can be precisely and independently controlled by switching the wavelength of the light.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules enable on&#8208;demand generation of active species via external light stimulation, allowing for precise spatiotemporal control over their activation. Molecular photoswitches, which typically undergo reversible transitions between two thermodynamically stable states upon irradiation with distinct wavelengths, are highly valuable tools with broad utility in different research areas. Herein, we introduce a new class of photoactivatable photoswitches: the switchable molecules are designed to undergo initial photochemical activation from a stable precursor upon irradiation at &#955;1, generating active photoswitches that exhibit reversible isomerization when irradiated with two other wavelengths (&#955;2 and &#955;3) of light. Crucially, neither &#955;2 nor &#955;3 alone activates the photoswitch precursor, ensuring temporal and orthogonal control over both activation and switching processes. This photoactivatable system operates through a sequential photochemical pathway that involves a photoinduced tetrazole&#8211;hydrazone transformation, followed by E/Z photoisomerization of the resulting hydrazone motif. Upon irradiation at &#955;1, the diaryl tetrazole precursor undergoes rapid photolysis with concomitant nitrogen extrusion, generating a reactive nitrile imine (NI) intermediate. This intermediate subsequently undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic addition to furnish the hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch in situ. Notably, strategic incorporation of heteroatoms within the molecular architecture significantly enhances the thermal stability of both E/Z isomers by facilitating intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.

         <title>Pollutants Transformation During the Regeneration Process of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid catalytic cracking is the main pollutant source in crude oil refineries due to spent catalyst regeneration. In this work, flue gas pollutants are monitored and coke deposits are identified. Operando and in situ spectroscopy are developed to explore coke species evolution, coupled with online gas infrared spectroscopy to detect pollutant formation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the gradual transformation mechanism from coke toward pollutants genesis is revealed.








Abstract
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major process for heavy oil conversion in current refineries and is explored for the intake of renewable feedstocks, like biomass and plastic waste. Due to coke deposition, FCC catalysts undergo continuous reaction&#8208;regeneration cycles. However, many gas pollutants are generated in the FCC regeneration process, and their emission characteristics and formation mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we conducted stack tests of three industrial FCC units to monitor pollutant emissions. The spent catalysts were characterized to identify the carbon deposits formed. We developed a method to correlate the decomposition of carbon deposits and the formation of gas pollutants in regeneration experiments using in situ Raman spectroscopy, operando FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, and online gas&#8208;phase FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The evolution of coke species is significantly influenced by the oxygen content of the regeneration gas, leading to differences in emission concentration and formation temperature of various gas pollutants. The experimental results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explain the formation of the major gas pollutants. This work is expected to advance pollutant emission prediction and control in FCC regeneration, thereby laying the foundation of future work in which different fossil&#8208;based and renewable feedstock compositions can be compared, including their effect on gas pollutant formation.

         <title>An Intrinsically Conductive Cross&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Quinhydrone&#8208;Like Donor&#8211;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HOT&#8208;DOT, an intrinsically conductive cross&#8208;conjugated polymer, features a covalently integrated, quinhydrone&#8208;like donor&#8211;acceptor network formed through spontaneous air oxidation. This built&#8208;in architecture enables self&#8208;doping, stable polarons, and efficient charge transport without dopants. HOT&#8208;DOT films show high conductivity and rare positive temperature coefficient, offering a new paradigm for organic electronic materials.








Abstract
Intrinsically conductive polymers free of unstable mobile dopants are highly sought after for stable and reliable electronic performance, yet remain scarce due to synthetic challenges. Here we report poly(3,4&#8208;dihydroxythiophene&#8208;alt&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dione) (HOT&#8208;DOT), a novel cross&#8208;conjugated polymer and the first polymeric analogue of a quinhydrone&#8208;like charge&#8208;transfer complex with intrinsic conductivity. HOT&#8208;DOT is synthesized through a straightforward three&#8208;step route, in which the final air oxidation step spontaneously generates a perfectly balanced 1:1 donor&#8211;acceptor architecture that promotes self&#8208;doping and stabilizes polarons. The polymer exhibits a narrow bandgap (1.38&#160;eV), broad near&#8208;infrared absorption, and high conductivity (&#8764;0.29 S cm&#8722;1), enabled by an ultrasmall &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (3.25&#160;&#197;) despite its cross&#8208;conjugated backbone. Spectroscopic and computational analyses reveal that strong interchain donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, reinforced by ammonia coordination, stabilize the self&#8208;doped state. HOT&#8208;DOT further displays rare positive temperature coefficient (PTC) behavior and long&#8208;term ambient stability. As a proof of concept, flexible temperature sensors fabricated from HOT&#8208;DOT films show reproducible and linear thermal responses over multiple cycles. This study establishes polymeric charge&#8208;transfer complexes as a new design paradigm for intrinsically conductive, dopant&#8208;free polymers with distinctive transport and sensing properties.

         <title>Revealing Pathway Complexity in Host&#8211;Guest Binding: Allosteric Regulation and Temporal Chiral Inversion During Complexation of Naphtho[2,2]urils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NGU[2,2] undergoes chiral inversion upon sequential binding of chiral guests. Stepwise 1:1 to 1:2 complexation switches conformational preference between SP and RP states, producing CD inversion with transient overshoot&#8212;an unprecedented example of chiral allosteric regulation in host&#8211;guest chemistry. 








Abstract
Studies on pathway complexity in supramolecular polymerization have uncovered intriguing kinetic behaviors, though these are not directly transferable to host&#8211;guest systems. Here, we report unprecedented chiral inversion kinetics in a host&#8211;guest complexation process, arising from the coupling of sequential binding and conformational interconversion. Naphtho[n,n]urils (NGU[n,n]), constructed by alternating glycoluril and naphthyl units, were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component condensation, yielding hybrid architectures with well&#8208;defined cavities. In NGU[2,2], the two naphthyl units adopt either SP or RP planar chiral conformations, giving rise to interconvertible racemic and meso conformers. NGU[2,2] binds chiral amino acid derivatives stepwise through hydrogen bonding and cation&#8211;dipole interactions, forming 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. Complexation shifts the equilibrium between racemic and meso conformers, inducing a circular dichroism (CD) response. Notably, the transition from the 1:1 to the 1:2 complex triggers an inversion of conformational preference in NGU[2,2], representing a unique case of chiral allosteric regulation. Furthermore, temporal inversion of the CD signal was observed upon mixing NGU[2,2] with the guest, displaying a transient overshoot and sign reversal. This kinetic behavior originates from the interplay between binding dynamics and conformational interconversion, with the meso conformer playing a central role.

         <title>Oxalate&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Fe(II) Drives Concerted Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of NO2 by Substantial Spin Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>In the environment, oxalic acid (OA) coordinates with iron species to form oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complexes. These complexes show unique antiferromagnetic interactions, enabling a previously unreported two&#8208;electron reduction pathway of NO2, in which NO2 is directly reduced to NO. This mechanism stands in sharp contrast to the conventionally single&#8208;electron reduction pathway, where NO2 is first reduced to nitrite. This discovery broadens the understanding of the nitrogen cycle's chemistry.


Abstract
NO2 reduction plays a key role in the active nitrogen cycle, influencing atmospheric oxidation capacity and secondary aerosol formation. NO2 reduction is commonly believed to proceed via a single&#8208;electron reduction pathway, yielding NO2&#8722; or HONO as primary products. Here, we report that oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex can lead to the two&#8208;electron reduction of NO2 directly to NO, while the citrate&#8208;coordinated Fe(II) primarily reduces NO2 to HONO through the common single&#8208;electron reduction pathway. We systematically compare the coordination and magnetic properties between this oxalate&#8208;bridged Fe(II) complex with the citrate&#8208;coordinated one. Unlike the paramagnetic Fe(II) citrate complex with disordered Fe spin alignments, the oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex exhibits antiferromagnetic interactions with antiparallel spin alignments of the unpaired electrons between the two Fe(II) centers. We propose that such antiferromagnetic interactions facilitate the concerted transfer of the two electrons with antiparallel spin alignments from each Fe(II) centers in the oxalate&#8208;bridged Fe(II) complex to the empty lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NO2, leading to NO formation. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a two&#8208;electron reduction pathway of NO2 by the oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex formed from environmentally abundant iron oxides and oxalic acid, providing new insights into the active nitrogen cycling.

         <title>Bright and Color&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Excimer Emission from Pre&#8208;Organized, Naphthalene Diimide Molecular Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents color&#8208;tunable and efficient excimer circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from arylenediimides through core&#8208;substitution. The study highlights pre&#8208;organized chiral bischromophoric designs, which produce some of the brightest green and red CPL emitters among purely organic systems, exhibiting solution&#8208;state dissymmetry factors in the order of&#160;10&#8722;2.








Abstract
Within the realm of organic materials, excimer emission has emerged as an efficient strategy for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active systems, owing to its intrinsic combination of high brightness and large dissymmetry factors (glum). Nevertheless, progress with this approach has been constrained by limited color tunability and substrate scope, with red&#8208;emissive circularly polarized excimer emission remaining essentially unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that core&#8208;substitution chemistry of naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives offers a versatile platform to achieve tunable excimeric CPL spanning the visible range, from 500&#160;nm (green) to 650&#160;nm (red), reported here for the first time. By employing cyclophane and clip&#8208;like pre&#8208;organized molecular architectures, excited&#8208;state chirality was effectively introduced, affording bright circularly polarized excimer emission with impressively high glum values of up to 4.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (green) and 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (red), along with remarkable CPL brightness. These results, combining outstanding brightness with the rare realization of red&#8208;emissive excimeric CPL, place these systems among the highest&#8208;performing small molecule CPL emitters to date.

         <title>Sequential Heterolytic Carbon&#8208;Halide and Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Activation in Unactivated Piperidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organometallic cascade reaction of 4&#8208;halo&#8208; and 4,4&#8208;dihalopiperidines consisting of heterolytic C&#9472;F bond activation, fast ring opening of a short&#8208;lived carbocation toward a stabilized iminium ion, and final alkyl or aryl delivery from the concomitantly generated ate metal complex is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two cationic reaction intermediates trapped together in a single crystal provides a unique snapshot of this process.








Abstract
The thermodynamic stability of unactivated Csp3&#9472;F and Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bonds remains a major challenge in organic synthesis as methods that achieve effective cleavage and high&#8208;yielding functionalization under mild conditions are rare. Herein, we introduce a cascade reaction involving heterolytic activation of 4&#8208;halopiperidines with organoaluminum reagents which is followed by fast ring opening toward a thermodynamically favored iminium ion that undergoes C&#9472;C bond formation via aryl or alkyl transfer from a concomitantly generated fluoroaluminate counteranion. Fluoropiperidines were found to be more reactive than other halides and are smoothly transformed into tertiary homoallyl amines with good to excellent yields. This reaction occurs at room temperature with high functional group tolerance and without noticeable by&#8208;product formation. Similarly, Csp3&#9472;F bond scission is observed with 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidines, giving rise to monofluorinated alkene products as the Csp2&#9472;F bond generated during this process does not react. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two cationic reaction intermediates simultaneously isolated in a single crystal provides a snapshot of the ring&#8208;opening process and together with chemical trapping and control experiments is in agreement with an ionic mechanism and a three&#8208;step reaction sequence. By contrast, defluorinative halide exchange leaving the piperidinyl ring intact prevails when 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidines are treated with aluminum trihalide Lewis acids.

In their Research Article (e202515805), Ye Wang et&#160;al. report the controllable synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy, &lt; 2 nm) via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy enhances the atom utilization of Pd and modulates its geometric structure. The sub&#8208;2 nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

         <title>High Performance Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Battery Electrolytes Regulation Mechanism: A Review</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulatory mechanism of sulfur&#8208;based solid electrolytes was reviewed in detail. Based on the problems of thermodynamic and kinetic instability and failure that exist, the mechanism of the regulation strategy was explored from aspects such as the soft&#8211;hard&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and the glass structure theory. It provides an important reference for the future development of sulfur&#8208;based SEs with both air stability, high ionic conductivity, and good contact performance.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) exhibit excellent ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties, but their poor air stability and solid&#8211;solid contact performance seriously hinder the wide application of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Herein, this paper reviews the history and the major breakthroughs in the development of sulfide SEs. The theories of hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and glass structure theory, as well as several strategies to improve the chemical stability of sulfide SEs, are discussed emphatically. In addition, this paper also explores its thermal runaway mechanism and reaction mechanism from the aspects of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, providing a reference for the research on improving stability and electrical conductivity. Finally, we summarized the challenges that still need to be addressed at present, as well as the research directions and prospects of sulfide SEs for ASSBs in the future.

This review systematically compares structural and electronic properties of three iron porphyrin carbene isomers&#8212;terminal, bridged, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;across enzymatic and synthetic systems. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals protein&#8208;induced adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, while M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies elucidate ground&#8208;state electronic configurations and spin transitions. Critical connections between synthetic models and engineered proteins are established, advancing mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer catalysis. 








Abstract
Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs), pivotal intermediates in enzymatic carbene transfer reactions, adopt diverse bonding modes and electronic configurations that govern their catalytic functions. This review systematically compares three IPC isomers&#8212;terminal carbenes, bridged carbenes, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;isolated from enzymatic systems with synthetic analogues. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, which reveals protein&#8208;induced structural adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, also facilitates M&#246;ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies. Besides ground state assignments on the bridged carbene [Fe(TPP){C&#9552;C(p&#8208;ClPh)2}C1] ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)2(dz2)1) and the N&#8208;alkyl Mb(N&#8208;CH2COBzyl)(His) ((dxy)2(dxz)1(dyz)1(dz2)1(dx2&#8722;y2)1), M&#246;ssbauer studies also reveal that alongside carbene fragment migration, the bridged carbene, which show shorter Fe&#9472;C(R) distance than the &#963; type Fe&#9472;C(sp2/sp3) bond, retains strong &#960; acceptor capability, in contrast to the stronger &#963; donor and &#960; acceptor capability of the terminal carbene and the N&#8208;alky derivative which nearly loses the bonding to iron. Accordingly, very large tetragonalities (|&#916;/&#955;|&#160;&gt;&#160;16) are observed for the bridged carbene Mb(CHCO2Et)(NMH) ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3) which exhibited rhombic EPR pattern under the near parallel ligand orientation. This work establishes critical connections between synthetic porphyrin and enzymatic systems, highlighting the adjustable scaffolds of engineered proteins in stabilizing various intermediates and advancing the mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer reactions.

         <title>Development and Application of Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereochemical Epimerization in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;mediated stereochemical epimerization enables direct stereochemical editing at inert C&#9472;H sites and late&#8208;stage modifications of complex molecules. By controlling hydrogen atom transfer through abstraction and donation, and bond cleavage and reformation, researchers have achieved site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization at challenging positions, including unactivated tertiary carbons and sterically hindered quaternary carbon stereocenters. This strategy facilitates the total synthesis of natural products.









Abstract
Precise control over stereochemistry (enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity) is essential in the long&#8208;step synthetic protocol of complex molecules bearing multiple stereocenters, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals. Stereospecificity is the ideal goal for the formation of the first and subsequent chiral centers in the specific chemical environment through either an exo&#8208; or endo&#8208;genous molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. In this context, epimerization and isomerization offer valuable supplemental strategies for modifying preexisting stereocenters, thereby enhancing synthetic efficiency, enabling molecular diversification, and facilitating late&#8208;stage modification. Recent advances in radical&#8208;mediated epimerization have further enabled site&#8208;specific inversion of stereocenters, allowing late&#8208;stage access to diverse stereoisomers from a common intermediate. This minireview highlights emerging approaches in radical&#8208;based stereochemical epimerization and discusses their potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules, emphasizing their role as a complementary strategy to previously established epimerization tactics. Also covered are recent developments in the epimerization of quaternary carbon stereocenters, an underexplored yet promising area that offers new opportunities for innovation in synthetic design.

         <title>Fully&#8208;Functionalized Natural Product Probes to Expand the Chemical Tractability of the Human Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit the inherent structural complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a unique library of photoaffinity (PA) probes, which we term fully functionalized natural products (FFNPs). Using mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemical proteomics, we uncover hundreds of topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective interactions with functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes in live cells. This work supports the potential of FFNPs to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.








Abstract
Photoaffinity (PA)&#8208;based chemoproteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means for proteome&#8208;wide mapping of ligandable proteins directly in cells, as well as the concatenated discovery of small molecule chemical probes. However, due to the relatively low throughput of screening small molecule libraries by proteomics and the synthetic burden incurred in installing the requisite photoactivatable functionality on each member, great priority must be placed on library design to maximize efficient exploration of biologically relevant chemical space and to ensure the identification of authentic binding interactions. To address this challenge, here we leverage the inherent complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a structurally unique series of diastereo/regioisomeric PA probes for ligand discovery in cells. Through semi&#8208;synthesis, we exploit sp3&#8208;rich NP scaffolds and employ mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomics to identify and quantify their interactions in human cells, uncovering topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective ligands for functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of NP&#8208;inspired chemoproteomic libraries to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.

Through semi-synthesis, we exploit sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-rich NP scaffolds and employ mass spectrometry (MS)-based chemoproteomics to identify and quantify their interactions in human cells, uncovering topology, regio-, and stereoselective ligands for functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of NP-inspired chemoproteomic libraries to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cupin&#8208;Type Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Lyase from Pelagibacter ubique (DddKPu) Catalyzes Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Primary and Secondary Amines to Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DddK) was identified as an efficient aza&#8208;Michaelase for the addition of amines to acrylate. Screening 74 amines with wild&#8208;type DddK and its W26G variant yielded N&#8208;substituted and N,N&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;&#8208;amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza&#8208;Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza&#8208;Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza&#8208;Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 (DddKPu). In vivo DddKPu catalyzes the &#946;&#8208;elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa&#8208;Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddKPu against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild&#8208;type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of N,N&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddKPu as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.

         <title>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of Non&#8208;Activated Oximes Catalyzed by Aldoxime Dehydratases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic mode of aldoxime dehydratases for the abiotic radical ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketoximes is reported. Aldoxime dehydratase from Nocardioides simplex was found to efficiently generate iminyl radicals from challenging &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; cycloketone oximes and to promote radical ring&#8208;opening reactions to produce &#947;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;sulfinylated nitriles under mild conditions. 








Abstract
The iminyl radical is a distinctive N&#8208;centered radical which serves as a versatile synthon in preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In principle, iminyl radicals can be directly generated by single electron reduction of oximes through elimination of OH group. However, due to the low reactivity of the oxime N&#9472;OH bonds, direct conversion of the oximes does not proceed efficiently, thereby enforcing chemical activation of the oxime OH group which results in the formation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products. To overcome this problem, we are developing a new biocatalytic system using aldoxime dehydratases. Through a series of enzyme screenings, we identified an aldoxime dehydratase from N. simplex (NsOxd) which is capable of catalyzing iminyl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening reactions. Notably, NsOxd efficiently converts the &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; 2&#8208;phenylcyclobutanone oxime within 10&#160;min under ambient conditions and quantitatively produces the corresponding &#947;&#8208;sulfinylated nitrile in &gt;95% yield. This enzyme activity is even faster than that of previously&#8208;reported chemo&#8208;catalysts. Furthermore, evaluation of the scope of potential substrates indicates that NsOxd has a versatile N&#9472;O bond cleaving activity which efficiently generates iminyl radicals from various &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes. These findings highlight the utility of aldoxime dehydratases for managing the reactivity of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes and for achieving challenging iminyl radical&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions.

         <title>Truxenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework/Carbon Nanotube Composite for High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode exhibits excellent sodium storage performance at low temperature with high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries face great challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Redox covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with porous structures provide a viable solution to accelerate the ionic diffusion and reaction kinetics at low temperatures. However, the applications of COFs in low&#8208;temperature batteries are still at their infancy stage. Here, a composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The truxenone&#8208;based COF possesses high ratio of active centers and enables high theoretical capacity; while the CNTs guarantee the accessibility of the active sites, the charge transfer efficiency, and the fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the composite electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 365 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 (295 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution). Notably, it offers excellent low&#8208;temperature performance that maintains a high discharge capacity of 263.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (203 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) at 0 &#176;C, which represents 74% of the capacity at room temperature. Even under extreme weather of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the capacity maintains 156.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (119 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 97%. This work illustrates the synergistic effect of the fast ionic diffusion of truxenone&#8208;based COF and the excellent charge transfer of the CNTs, offering a feasible way to realize low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Tellurium&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Support Boosting Platinum Catalysis in High&#8208;Efficiency Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) and nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were introduced into graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC) to support small Pt nanoparticles (average size of 3.2&#160;nm) with uniform high loading (40 wt%), yielding the Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC catalyst. Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediated electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt enhanced high&#8208;voltage stability and the catalytic activity of Pt, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells necessitates optimization of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under high&#8208;voltage conditions through improved Pt catalysis. This study introduces an electrocatalyst that uniformly anchors a high loading (40 wt%) of small Pt nanoparticles (3.2&#160;nm) on a novel support: tellurium and nitrogen co&#8208;mediated graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC). The strong metal&#8211;support interactions arise from Pt&#9472;Te and Pt&#9472;N bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediation enhances the high&#8208;voltage oxidation resistance of Pt via electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt. Consequently, the Pt valence state in Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC increases by only +0.085 from open&#8208;circuit potential to 1.5&#160;V, resulting in exceptional durability over 100&#160;000 high&#8208;voltage cycles (1&#8211;1.5&#160;V) with negligible morphological aggregation. Moreover, the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, enabling Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC to achieve outstanding activity (0.7&#160;V at 1.26 A cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;air conditions). This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high&#8208;voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high&#8208;efficiency fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;Tellurium (Te) and nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were introduced into graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC) to support small Pt nanoparticles (average size of 3.2&#160;nm) with uniform high loading (40 wt%), yielding the Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC catalyst. Te&#8211;N co-mediated electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt enhanced high-voltage stability and the catalytic activity of Pt, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells necessitates optimization of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under high-voltage conditions through improved Pt catalysis. This study introduces an electrocatalyst that uniformly anchors a high loading (40 wt%) of small Pt nanoparticles (3.2&#160;nm) on a novel support: tellurium and nitrogen co-mediated graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC). The strong metal&#8211;support interactions arise from Pt&#9472;Te and Pt&#9472;N bonds.

This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high-voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high-efficiency fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Multistate Mechanoresistance in a Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Incorporating Energy&#8208;Dissipative Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded sacrificial unit exhibits enhanced mechanoresistive behavior. The sacrificial conformational transition can be achieved through the regulation of intramolecular dispersion forces, while realizing multiple stable electrical signals as the junction is compressed and stretched, laying the foundation for constructing multimodal mechanical molecular switches at the molecular level.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive molecular devices are capable of exhibiting dynamic responses to external mechanical stimuli, enabling applications in smart materials, nano&#8208;devices, and flexible electronics. However, energy conversion induced by mechanical stimuli requires efficient energy dissipation mechanisms. Traditional methods often involve bond breaking or incomplete energy release, which can lead to device failure during continuous operations. Therefore, ensuring the mechanical stability of molecular devices under cyclic external forces remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a pillar[6]arene&#8208;like cyclophane (PLC) as an energy&#8208;dissipative structure to construct a programmable multistate mechanoswitching at the single&#8208;molecule level. We observed that, compared to rigid molecules with low energy dissipation, PLC&#8208;based macrocyclic molecular devices not only withstand mechanical stretching up to 6&#160;&#197; but also exhibit three stable states during the mechanical stretching/compressing processes. Combined with theoretical calculations, we confirm that these three distinct states are related to the charge transport pathways and the strength of the electrode&#8208;molecule interface coupling. This work establishes energy dissipation as a core design principle for multistate mechanoelectronic devices.

         <title>Control of Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Reactivity by Rotaxanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been achieved by rotaxanation. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield and they displayed a much slower kinetics compared to the corresponding thread. Mechanical bond disassembly upon the right stimulus activates reactivity. Indeed, IEDDA could be selectively activated inside senescent surrogate cells by a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive rotaxane.








Abstract
Rotaxanation is an efficient method to control the tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield by crown ether active template applied to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines. Kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazine rotaxanes were much slower than those with the corresponding threads. Interestingly, disassembly of the mechanical bond upon the application of the right stimulus activates IEDDA. Control of IEDDA in live cells was proved by means of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase sensitive tetrazine rotaxane: Enzymatic digestion allowed the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, which resulted in a fluorescent compound.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Cost Lacunary Metal&#8208;Oxo Framework Enables Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

A novel inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework, BSiW9, serves as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs, resulting in not only a remarkable PCE but also outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture usually exhibit decent efficiency due to the easily tunable energy levels of organic interfacial layers (ILs). However, their operational lifetime is limited by the morphological instability of organic ILs especially the electron&#8208;transporting layer (ETL) that shows strong self&#8208;aggregation tendency. Besides, organic ETLs are confronted with significant challenges including large batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations and high costs. Herein, we develop an inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. The resultant molecule, BSiW9, not only shows ultralow cost but also leads to significantly enhanced electron extraction in OSCs. Moreover, the redox activity of BSiW9 allows reinforced electrical conductivity by using a hydroquinone&#8208;derivative dopant, HQ. The doping strategy finally results in a remarkable PCE of 20.5% in p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSC, largely outperforming that using organic ETLs. Meanwhile, an outstanding long&#8208;term stability is obtained in this champion device, with 92% of original efficiency maintained after a maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking for 1250&#160;h, among the longest lifetimes of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing rationally tailored low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;oxo framework as ILs for more industrially compatible OSCs.

         <title>Regioselective Zr5 Nanocluster Photocatalyst for Precise Protein Editing Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster serves as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for regioselective oxidative cleavage and side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme protein. Upon UV irradiation, it generates reactive oxygens species (ROS), with reaction selectivity guided by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the cluster's positively charged surface and electrostatically negatively charged regions on the protein near the cleavage sites.








Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modifications on protein structure and function is of central importance in protein chemistry, necessitating precise and controlled methods for introducing such modifications. Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr5&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst. The&#160; [ZrIV5(&#956;&#9472;&#927;&#919;)2(&#956;&#9472;&#927;)2(&#956;3&#9472;&#927;)Cl2(H2O)6(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1&#8208;tBu&#8208;dihyde&#8208;O,O&#8242;,O&#8243;)5] (Zr5) cluster features a unique [Zr5O5] structural motif and&#160;its electronic structure and light absorption properties&#160;were fully analyzed and reproduced through Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory&#160;(DFT) calculations.&#160;Zr5&#160;exhibits exceptional photophysical properties, including the optical gap of 2.01&#160;eV, the lowest reported to date for a zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster. Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr5&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle&#8208;down proteomics applications. Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr5&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr5&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.

Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible-light photocatalyst. The&#160; [Zr&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;

Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side-chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle-down proteomics applications. Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report that highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets (&#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) could be synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction of ultradilute precursors (Co(NO3)2 + 2&#8208;methyimidazole (HmIm) + H2O system) at room temperature in just 1 h. By using thin coatings of the as&#8208;synthesized &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as self&#8208;sacrificial templates, &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes could be fabricated in a facile way. The prepared ZIF&#8208;67 membranes demonstrated attractive H2 sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) is an important class of nanoporous materials for high&#8208;performance membranes for gas separation, offering uniform&#8208;sized gas&#8208;selective pores. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes, critical for high&#8208;performance separation, has remained elusive. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes. We identify a simple and rapid route to prepare &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor to ZIF&#8208;67. Highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction at room temperature in just 1 h using ultradilute cobalt and linker concentrations in water. The resulting high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets yield compact coating on porous polymeric supports. Well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;67 membranes are prepared by thermal treatment of nanosheets in the presence of a linker and exhibit attractive hydrogen sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C). This approach provides a scalable and versatile platform for hydrogen separation for applications such as precombustion carbon capture.

         <title>Organocatalytic Microfluidic Double&#8208;Layer Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highest expectations from catalysis with external electric fields, from organic synthesis to sustainable industrial production and the origin of life, cannot be explored because of&#160;the incompatibility with scalable bulk conditions. This challenge is addressed with bioinspired organocatalytic electrical double&#8208;layer architectures as supramolecular electrodes in microfluidic capacitors. The result is an enabling method for scalable electric&#8208;field catalysis.








Abstract
Ideas to use external electric fields to enable, accelerate and direct the movement of electrons during chemical reactions are not new. Theory and experiments under special conditions predict that electric&#8208;field catalysis (EFC) from externally applied fields could change the way we make molecules. The challenge is the incompatibility with organic synthesis under scalable bulk conditions. Access to applied electric fields (AEFs) &gt; 1&#160;V nm&#8722;1, predicted as necessary for direct transition&#8208;state stabilization, is not possible even with electromicrofluidic systems, where the distance between the plate electrodes is minimized. Therefore, we decided to shift our attention from the applied fields to their consequences. We consider electrical double layers (EDLs) that form within a few nanometers from the plate electrodes as engineerable supramolecular electrodes. Applying lessons from cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), we report supramolecular electrodes with effective electric fields (EEFs) that exceed applied fields by more than five million. According to a proline&#8208;catalyzed aldol condensation installed as benchmark reaction, those engineered from polyarginine and pyrenebutyrate are most active for EFC, exactly as in cellular uptake. With the best supramolecular electrodes, EFC triples the yield of one of the most optimized reactions in organocatalysis. New methods to access scalable EFC open up broad perspectives in organic synthesis and beyond.

         <title>Interfacial Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL&#8208;125@ZIF&#8208;8 catalyst, featuring asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfacial sites, enables photocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and N2. At the Zn sites, CO2 is reduced to *CO species, while N2 is activated at the Ti sites to form *NH&#8211;NH intermediates. The asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfaces facilitate the coupling of *CO with *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urea photosynthesis.








Abstract
Urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 has profound environmental and energy implications. However, the simultaneous activation of CO2 and N2, along with the promotion of C&#9472;N bond formation, remains a major challenge. Herein, the asymmetric interfacial sites (Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti) were engineered by building oxygen atom bridges between ZIF&#8208;8 and MIL&#8208;125 to enable efficient photocatalytic urea synthesis. The optimized Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interface structure achieves a urea yield of 130&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water and an apparent quantum yield of 5.52% at 350&#160;nm, outperforming most materials reported for urea photosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Zn sites catalyze the conversion of CO2 to *CO species, while Ti sites adsorb and activate N2 to generate *NH&#8211;NH species. The asymmetric interfacial sites lower the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby promoting urea photosynthesis. This work provides significant insights into designing interfacial asymmetric sites to facilitate photosynthetic organic chemicals for upgrading the nitrogen cycle.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers via Photoinduced Radical Copolymerization of Levoglucosenone and Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers was synthesized via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and commercially available vinyl ethers. The resulting polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, high glass transition temperatures (up to 212&#160;&#176;C), and efficient degradability. In addition, the sugar&#8208;based materials display exceptional adhesion strength, surpassing that of widely used commercial adhesives. Postpolymerization modifications further enabled access to fluorescent materials and grafted semiconducting polymers.








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a library of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and a broad range of commercially available vinyl ethers. This strategy leverages renewable feedstocks and enables precise control over copolymer sequence, affording materials with excellent thermal stability, tunable glass transition temperature (Tg), and on&#8208;demand degradability. The resulting sugar&#8208;based materials exhibit superior adhesive strength compared to commercial benchmarks such as commercial polyurethane adhesive and ethylene&#8208;vinyl acetate (EVA). Postpolymerization modifications further facilitate the preparation of fluorescent materials and graft semiconducting polymers, expanding the functional versatility of these sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers.

     alt="Sugar-Based Alternating Copolymers via Photoinduced Radical Copolymerization of Levoglucosenone and Vinyl Ethers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family of 17 sugar-based alternating copolymers was synthesized via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and commercially available vinyl ethers. The resulting polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, high glass transition temperatures (up to 212&#160;&#176;C), and efficient degradability. In addition, the sugar-based materials display exceptional adhesion strength, surpassing that of widely used commercial adhesives. Postpolymerization modifications further enabled access to fluorescent materials and grafted semiconducting polymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis of a library of 17 sugar-based alternating copolymers via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and a broad range of commercially available vinyl ethers. This strategy leverages renewable feedstocks and enables precise control over copolymer sequence, affording materials with excellent thermal stability, tunable glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and on-demand degradability. The resulting sugar-based materials exhibit superior adhesive strength compared to commercial benchmarks such as commercial polyurethane adhesive and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). Postpolymerization modifications further facilitate the preparation of fluorescent materials and graft semiconducting polymers, expanding the functional versatility of these sugar-based alternating copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interactional Features of (RO)4Ti Species and Their Zr and Hf Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational and experimental studies reveal that Group 4 tetroxides form a new type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction with N and O nucleophiles, which we propose to name &#8220;titan bonds&#8221; (TnBs). These insights into Ti, Zr, and Hf interactions may aid in the rational design of more selective catalysts for aldol and oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Tetroxides of Group 4 elements are benchmark catalysts for aldol reactions and oxidation processes, achieving high yields and regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Our computational analyses and experimental studies, performed in solution and solid, consistently reveal that these tetroxides form attractive interactions with lone pair compounds exhibiting distinctive &#963;&#8208;hole bond features. We propose naming these novel bondings as titan bonds (TnBs). These new insights into Ti/Zr/Hf tetroxide interactions may significantly aid in designing more effective catalysts with enhanced selectivities.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Calyciphylline F</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic Daphniphyllum alkaloids was the Calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid, featuring a strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Presented herein is the total synthesis of calyciphylline F, a member of the calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid family, by an intramolecular [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles, an intramolecular aldol reaction, and three C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming radical reactions.








Abstract
Calyciphylline F represents the final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic&#8208;type of Daphniphyllum alkaloids due to the strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Here, we report the total synthesis of calyciphylline F. We construct the ring system by applying [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles with 2&#8208;oxyallyl cations to an intramolecular reaction, followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction and capture of the resulting alkoxide as the xanthate. The bridgehead quaternary carbon center is constructed by the intramolecular addition reaction of the bridgehead radical to the alkoxy&#8208;acrylate, which is designed based on the proposed mechanism of by&#8208;product formation. Finally, another 6&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization reaction constructs the last remaining ring and achieves the total synthesis of calyciphylline F.

         <title>Probing and Enhancing DNA Ligase Specificity via Se&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mutagenesis of ATP for Accurate Gene Synthesis and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The O&#8208;to&#8208;Se&#8208;atom substitution enables the probing and study of mismatch discrimination at the atomic level, and the Se atom in ATP&#945;Se has been used to probe the key interactions and enhance DNA ligation specificity (up to 1000&#8208;fold) within an expanded region (8&#160;nt), allowing the more efficient gene synthesis (200&#8208;fold enhancement) and the more accurate single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection.








Abstract
Discriminating against base&#8208;pair mismatches by nucleic acid&#8208;related enzymes is essential for DNA replication, RNA replication, nucleic acid repair, transcription, and translation. However, the discrimination mechanisms at the atomic level remain poorly understood, limited by the availability of atom&#8208;probing methods. Herein, we developed a single&#8208;Se&#8208;atom strategy (using ATP&#945;Se) to explore mismatch discrimination in the DNA ligase system. We found that the Se&#8208;atom (substituting O) in ATP&#945;Se played a key role in the mismatch discrimination of DNA ligase, and ATP&#945;Se significantly improved the ligation specificity, achieving up to 1000&#8208;fold enhancement and expanding the region of mismatch discrimination up to 8&#160;nt. Sequencing ligation products of various substrates generally confirmed the specificity enhancement using ATP&#945;Se. Our mechanistic studies indicated that the specificity increase was correlated with the kcat reduction in mismatch ligations and with the disruption of the key interactions, supported by the site&#8208;specific ligase mutations. Further, using ATP&#945;Se, we achieved over 200&#8208;fold increase in gene assembly efficiency and accomplished mismatch suppression in the single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection. In conclusion, our Se&#8208;atom&#8208;probing strategy enables the atomic&#8208;level studies on mismatch discrimination and offers a useful tool for accuracy enhancement, highlighting its broad potential for exploring molecular recognition and specificity.

         <title>A Photothermal Nano&#8208;Switch for Tumor&#8208;Selective Wnt Hyperactivation in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) is presented for precise, spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis.








Abstract
Wnt signaling plays a paradoxical role in cancer, functioning as both a promoter and suppressor depending on its activation level. This duality underscores the critical need for precise and selective modulation, while existing Wnt&#8208;targeting strategies fail to achieve it due to inadequate specificity and control. Here, we report a photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) that enables spatiotemporal and selective activation of the Wnt pathway. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, localized heating disrupts Wif1&#8208;Wnt interactions, triggering controlled Wnt protein release. The liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis. In contrast, normal cells remain unaffected due to their lower basal Wnt activity, as confirmed by negligible cytotoxicity and unaltered apoptotic markers. In vivo, this system achieves robust antitumor effects in a 4T1 breast cancer model while ensuring safety for healthy tissues. By leveraging the optical properties of gold nanorods for conditional and selective activation, this study establishes a transformative platform for the precise modulation of Wnt signaling, offering significant promise for treating Wnt&#8208;dysregulated diseases with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Coordination Reconstruction Enhanced Synergistic Nonradical Oxidation Pathways in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustained Pollutant Destruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a coordination modification strategy, enabling O substitution of N in the first shell of cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts. The higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of Co&#8208;N2O2 over Co&#8208;N3O1 stems from more efficient generation and utilization of nonradical reactive oxygen species (e&#8722;, 1O2, HVMO). We achieved nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal in 10&#160;h dynamic membrane reaction and effective landfill leachate degradation.








Abstract
Limited synthetic efficiency and high costs constrain industrial production of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) despite their superior catalytic performance. We report a scalable and economical solid&#8208;state pyrolysis strategy for cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (Co&#8208;SACs) costing &#8764;$35&#160;kg&#8722;1. Hydrothermal O&#8208;substitution precisely engineers the coordination environment from Co&#8208;N3O1 to Co&#8208;N2O2. The upshifted d&#8208;band center and enhanced electron delocalization of Co&#8208;N2O2 decrease electron density at the Co site, strengthening peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance, probe experiments, and electrochemical tests synergistic confirmed that Co&#8208;N2O2 significantly promotes nonradical processes, including the generation of singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxo species, and electron transfer processes. The resultant Co&#8208;N2O2 catalyst achieved over 98% degradation of high&#8208;concentration sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) within 10&#160;min. The kilogram&#8208;scale Co&#8208;N2O2 (kg&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2) demonstrated outstanding efficiency in treating landfill leachate (2548&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 TOC removal) and preeminent stability in 14 cycles and 10&#160;h membrane dynamic experiments. This work provides both fundamental elucidation into coordination engineering and a practical solution for large&#8208;scale production of SACs in environmental remediation.

         <title>Hot Electron Photocatalysis Using Nontoxic Self&#8208;Doped Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast Auger processes efficiently generate hot electrons in quantum dots (QDs), enabling photoreduction of aryl halides (up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus SCE) and diverse cross&#8208;coupling reactions (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S). Quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs demonstrate significantly higher reactivity than CuInS2 QDs, due to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This study highlights the potential of using Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons from nontoxic QDs for challenging organic transformations under mild conditions.








Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as versatile photocatalysts for organic transformations. However, a significant drawback is their reliance on toxic metals like lead and cadmium, which limits their widespread application in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Furthermore, current systems primarily utilize band&#8208;edge carriers for simpler photoredox reactions, while the potential for harvesting hot carriers in chemical transformations remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we developed nontoxic, cost&#8208;effective, and recyclable ternary CuInS2 and quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs as potent photocatalysts. Our findings demonstrate that hot electrons can be effectively generated through an ultrafast Auger process, enabling the photoreduction of aryl halides (with reduction potentials up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) and various cross&#8208;coupling (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S) transformations. Notably, quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs exhibit significantly higher reactivity compared to CuInS2 QDs, which is attributed to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This work underscores the potential of directly utilizing Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons for extreme&#8208;potential organic transformations under mild conditions using nontoxic QDs.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions Modulate RNA:DNA Folding Observed via Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state nanopores enable the detection of RNA species at the single&#8208;molecule level. To rapidly and accurately identify barcoded RNAs as they translocate the pore, it is imperative to reduce analyte folding. Here, we demonstrate that RNA's supramolecular interactions with urea inhibit folding, increasing the number of readable barcodes while decreasing the number of events required for RNA identification. 








Abstract
DNA and RNA nanotechnology enables the precise assembly of molecular architectures, with applications in bioengineering, supramolecular chemistry, and sensing. The material properties of these biopolymers can be adjusted covalently or, more simply, through non&#8208;covalent interactions with small molecules. Herein, we demonstrate the use of urea, an abundant and inexpensive small molecule, to modulate the stiffness of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures. Our results suggest that supramolecular interactions between urea and the A&#8208;form&#8208;like helix rigidify the hybrid polymers, as evidenced by both solid&#8208;state nanopore measurements and atomic force microscopy. Nanopore sensing reveals that preparing topologically&#8208;barcoded RNA:DNA hybrids in urea results in a 50% reduction in folded translocations. This decrease in folded events improves the proportion of useable data points, paving the way for the robust detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA analytes at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation and Photodegradation in Difluoroboron&#8208;Based Organic Laser Gain Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in difluoroboron&#8208;based gain molecules is shown to originate from aggregated singlet states (S1), contradicting its previously assumed phosphorescent origin. Additionally, the delayed emission arises from a triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) mechanism rather than a thermally activated (TADF) process, with rapid photodegradation further complicating the excited&#8208;state dynamics and emphasizing the need for improved molecular design.








Abstract
In this study, we investigate the triplet exciton dynamics of a series of difluoroboron&#8208;based organic gain molecules. We synthesized three previously reported molecules from the difluoroboron family and examined their photophysical properties using time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations. Our results reveal that emission from these materials arises predominantly from the singlet manifold via prompt and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;driven delayed fluorescence, rather than from phosphorescence, challenging the earlier assumptions of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originating from the triplet manifold. In highly concentrated solutions, the emission shows strong resemblance to that of the crystalline phase, confirming its origin from aggregate singlet states rather than monomeric pathways. Further, the materials are prone to photodegradation, which gives rise to new high&#8208;energy fluorescence and phosphorescence bands adding to the complexity of the photophysics of this family of materials.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbon via High&#8208;Pressure Topochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positioning sp3&#8208;CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi&#8208;continuously tune the bandgap of [8]&#8208;AGNR. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization, we synthesized site&#8208;specific sp3&#8208;CH and N co&#8208;substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one&#8208;step synthesis method for producing various [8]&#8208;AGNRs with site&#8208;specific heteroatom substitution.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted broad attention for their potential application in nanoelectronics. The electronic properties of the GNRs are closely related to their chemical structure like width, edge, terminating and hetero atoms, etc., and widely applied synthetic methods for the scalable synthesis of specific GNRs with atom&#8208;scale precision are urgently required. Here, we found that the stoichiometric and ordered positioning of N and sp3&#8208;CH in 8&#8208;armchair&#8208;GNR ([8]&#8208;AGNR) effectively modifies their bandgap in a large range of 0&#8211;2.85&#160;eV by theoretical calculations. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization, three of these [8]&#8208;AGNRs were synthesized successfully in their bulk phase starting from crystalline dipyridinyl/dipyrimidinyl butadiynes, with the maximum nitrogen content of 27% in mass. The structures of these GNRs were demonstrated by spectroscopy, diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance methods. UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectra clearly evidenced the precise tuning of the electronic structures in these N and CH substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs. Our work shows great versatility of this high&#8208;pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site&#8208;specific N and sp3&#8208;CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure&#8208;specific carbon nano&#8208;materials.

&lt;p&gt;Positioning sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi-continuously tune the bandgap of [8]-AGNR. Employing our recent-developed high-pressure topochemical dehydro-Diels-Alder polymerization, we synthesized site-specific sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-CH and N co-substituted [8]-AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one-step synthesis method for producing various [8]-AGNRs with site-specific heteroatom substitution.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of the Formation of Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes in Liposome&#8208;Based Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ion transporters enable precise control over carboxylate transport across liposome membranes that are preloaded with Ln3+ ions. This process triggers the spatiotemporal formation of luminescent lanthanide complexes within liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors. Cryo&#8208;TEM and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveal that the complexation of lanthanides induces a structural transformation of liposomes from unilamellar to bilamellar vesicles. 








Abstract
The controlled mass transfer across compartmentalised environments in synthetic nanoreactors is essential for enhancing precise spatiotemporal manipulation of chemical transformations within confined spaces. In this study, we present a strategy that integrates a synthetic anion transporter in liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors, allowing for spatiotemporal control over the formation of metal&#8211;organic complexes in liposomes. This approach enables us to effectively modulate the assembly of luminescent lanthanide&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate nanostructures. Fluorescence studies demonstrate that the reaction rate can be customised by varying the anion transporter concentration, which dictates the rate of entry of the carboxylate ligand. Changes in the morphology of the liposome nanoreactors due to the assisted transmembrane transport of benzenedicarboxylate were investigated using cryo&#8208;TEM and time&#8208;resolved SAXS measurements, which revealed a structural transformation of the lipid bilayer during the complex formation. Our findings provide a novel platform for exploring coordination chemistry in nanoscale confinements, opening avenues for the design of biohybrid materials.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI, Electrophoresis&#8208;Correlative Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with AI&#8208;Based Data Processing Broadens Access to Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>

An affordable single&#8208;cell proteomics workflow combines capillary electrophoresis, real&#8208;time ion sorting, and AI&#8208;aided spectral deconvolution to profile early Xenopus embryonic cells. Despite using a legacy Orbitrap, this strategy matches or exceeds the sensitivity of modern instruments, uncovering proteome dynamics at sub&#8208;nanogram scale.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry (MS) offers unprecedented sensitivity for profiling cellular proteomes, yet widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of advanced instrumentation. Here, we broaden access to single&#8208;cell proteomics by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE), data&#8208;dependent acquisition (DDA) with electrophoresis&#8208;correlative (Eco) ion sorting, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted spectral deconvolution via CHIMERYS (Eco&#8211;AI). This &#8220;Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI&#8221; workflow was implemented on a custom&#8208;built CE platform coupled to a legacy hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus). Despite slower scan speed, lower resolution, and inferior ion transmission efficiency, real&#8208;time Eco&#8208;DDA sampling and CHIMERYS processing enabled identification of up to &#8764;15 peptides per spectrum&#8212;performance on par with modern Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid systems. From 1&#160;ng of HeLa digest, 2142 proteins were identified, surpassing the 969 proteins detected on a contemporary nanoLC Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Even from &#8764;250 pg (a single&#8208;cell equivalent), 1799 proteins were identified in &lt;15&#160;min of effective separation, raising a theoretical throughput of 48 samples per day. As proof of principle, Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI profiled 1524 proteins from single precursor cells (50&#8211;75&#160;&#181;m diameter) in Xenopus laevis blastulae, revealing proteome asymmetry during neural versus epidermal fate specification. These results establish Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI as a budget&#8208;conscious yet powerful strategy for single&#8208;cell proteomics using CE&#8211;MS.

         <title>Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Mo Site&#8208;Activated Nanozymes for Bienzymatic/Upconversion Synergistic Catalytic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;O&#8211;Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozyme (HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) modification is successfully constructed on up/downconversion (UC/DC) dual&#8208;emissive nanoparticles by a facile hydrothermal method. With the guidance of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), UC&#8208;induced electron&#160;&#8722;&#160;hole pairs synergize with bienzymatic activity to amplify ROS generation, enabling tumor&#8208;specific synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion catalytic therapy (ET/UCT).








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) hold promise for cancer therapy but suffer from low active site density and restricted intermediate adsorption/desorption capabilities. Herein, Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozymes (FeMoDA), encapsulated in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LPs) and surface&#8208;modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) (denoted as HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs), were developed for synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion&#8208;triggered catalytic therapy (ET/UCT) under second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom sites were bridged by Fe&#160;&#8722;&#160;O&#160;&#8722;&#160;Mo coordination, optimizing oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption/desorption, and improving dual&#8208;enzymatic activities. The peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic performance of HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs showed a Km of 11.54&#160;mM and a Vmax of 1.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M&#183;s&#8722;1, outperforming Fe&#8208; or Mo&#8208;single&#8208;atom coated LPs. HA modification promoted endocytosis (&#8764;5.67&#8208;fold) and microenvironmental acidification (pH from 7.21 to 6.74), further improving ET. Under 980&#160;nm irradiation, upconversion&#8208;triggered electrons synergized with oxidase&#8208;like activity to convert O2 into superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;), while holes enabled &#8226;O2&#8722; to singlet oxygen (1O2) conversion, which combined with POD&#8208;like&#8208;produced hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve synergistic ET/UCT. Tumor H+ and glutathione co&#8208;induced the specific degradation of nanozymes, resulting in tumor self&#8208;enhanced downconversion NIR&#8208;II and MR imaging. Compared with conventional SAzymes, HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs exhibit superior catalytic performance and dual&#8208;modal imaging, offering a synergistic and tumor&#8208;responsive platform for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Assisted Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient TADF Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.








Abstract
Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron&#8208;withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4tCzCN&#8208;pXT and 4tCzCN&#8208;pTXT, with multiple 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed. They own increased molecular vibrations, which promote intrinsic RISC process and enable multi&#8208;channel transitions via vibronic coupling of high&#8208;lying triplet states. Consequently, they exhibit fast RISC rates of up to 1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, being one order of magnitude higher than that of the symmetric control molecule. They can perform as luminescent materials in OLEDs, providing outstanding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.2% and 35.8% in non&#8208;doped and doped devices, respectively, with very small roll&#8208;offs. The OLEDs using them as sensitizers for multi&#8208;resonance emitters achieve remarkable EQEs over 40%, and extraordinary operational stability with LT90 of 24974&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating their great potentials in OLEDs.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal meta&#8208;Allenylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is developed through their redox&#8208;neutral temporary dearomatization to oxazinopyridines under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite, olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This is the first enantioselective functionalization of oxazinopyridines, which results in meta&#8208;allenylic pyridines with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.).








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines is an important yet challenging transformation. Temporary dearomatization of pyridines through redox&#8208;neutral cycloaddition has recently emerged as a reliable and attractive strategy for meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines. Despite the amenability of the resulting bench&#8208;stable cycloadduct, oxazinopyridine, to a variety of electrophilic and radical&#8208;based reagents, its enantioselective functionalization remains unexplored. Herein, we present the first enantioselective meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through the intermediacy of oxazinopyridines. This highly enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is achieved by treating the easily accessible oxazinopyridines with racemic allenylic alcohol under the combination of a catalytic amount of an Ir(I)/(P, olefin) complex and Lewis acidic Sc(OTf)3 followed by acid&#8208;mediated rearomatization. With oxazinopyridines derived from unsubstituted or suitably substituted pyridines, iterative 3,5&#8208;difunctionalization is possible, which also allows for the stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;allenylic pyridines.

         <title>Protein Cage Inspired Bridge&#8208;Island Effect Enables Low&#8208;Temperature Targeted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hierarchical Hollow Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a protein cage inspired ionic weaving strategy that enables the bottom&#8208;up construction of micro/nano hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) under mild conditions. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of soft templates is elucidated, wherein the VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the formation of microscale hollow frameworks and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathodes exhibit outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Achieving targeted morphological control over polyanionic cathodes under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. Drawing inspiration from the self&#8208;assembly of protein cages, we propose an ionic weaving strategy for the low&#8208;temperature fabrication of hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes. By introducing low&#8208;cost monosodium glutamate as a template precursor, the derived glutamate species self&#8208;assemble into hollow micellar soft templates under the coordination bridging of VO2+ ions. Subsequently, PO43&#8211;, Na+, and F&#8211; ions are electrostatically attracted to VO2+&#8208;anchored microdomains, triggering island&#8208;like nucleation. The VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the construction of microscale hollow soft templates and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals, thereby enabling micro/nano hierarchical hollow morphology control of NVOPF under mild conditions. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism underlying hollow soft template formation is systematically elucidated for the first time through a combination of soft matter probing techniques, including fluorescence microscopy and negative staining, supported by density functional theory calculations and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;rate cycling and excellent low&#8208;temperature durability. This work establishes a new paradigm that integrates supramolecular self&#8208;assembly with metal&#8208;ion coordination chemistry for the rational design of fast&#8208;charging polyanionic cathode materials.

Unraveling spacer cation&#8208;mediated degradation in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, this work introduces 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB) as a dual&#8208;functional stabilizer. CFB stabilizer suppresses spacer cation degradation and coordinates multi&#8208;stage crystallization. The corresponding precursor delivers extended shelf life and devices achieve a record&#8208;low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV.








Abstract
The aging dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions critically govern the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, the underlying degradation mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors remain elusive, particularly regarding the pivotal role of spacer cations in modulating decomposition pathways. This study elucidates the intrinsic aging mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, revealing that spacer cation integration fundamentally governs decomposition kinetics. A dual&#8208;functional solution stabilizer, 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB), is strategically designed to concurrently mitigate precursor degradation and regulate crystallization dynamics. The carboxyl moiety undergoes spontaneous deprotonation to establish robust hydrogen bonds with guanidinium (GA+), effectively suppressing methylamine (MA0)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attacks and preventing irreversible addition&#8208;elimination reactions between GA+ and MA0. Simultaneously, CFB orchestrates multi&#8208;stage crystallization control through coordination modulation, yielding highly oriented perovskite crystals with passivated grain boundaries. The optimized devices demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance with a remarkably low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV. Notably, devices fabricated from aged precursors maintain 90% of initial efficiency over 42 days of ambient storage. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices deliver optimized humidity stability and thermal stability.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Homing Liposomal Nanobot for Active Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self&#8208;homing GOD&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis and pH&#8208;guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB&#8208;TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB&#8208;TME through self&#8208;homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy. The lipoNbot features an asymmetric structure composed of GOD&#8208;modified cancer cell membranes and &#947;&#8208;glutamylated lipids, which synergistically enhance BBB&#8208;TME penetration through chemotactic diffusiophoresis and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis. The proton sponge effect facilitates lysosomal escape for BBB traversal. In vivo investigation indicates that lipoNbots achieve a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency. Such a lipoNbot poses the specific biochemical cues of GBM for self&#8208;homing navigation, establishing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept framework utilizing the pathological features for active therapy of central nervous system diseases.

         <title>Stereodivergent Assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction via Photoinduced Pd and Pd/Ir Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction is designed by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. Both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;allyl skeletons are achievable and stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is realized.








Abstract
Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction typically relies on the use of alkenes containing an &#945;&#8208;leaving group as the substrates. In comparison, an in situ assembling model from feedstock chemicals represents a distinctive and practically valuable route, yet remains undeveloped. Here we report an unprecedented excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. With the development of a HAT/Heck/allylation cascade protocol, various (E)&#8208;allyl compounds are prepared in good yields and stereoselectivities. Meanwhile, a novel photoinduced Pd/Ir relay catalysis is designed to enable stereoselective preparation of challenging (Z)&#8208;allyl compounds. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is also realized via this excited&#8208;state Pd chemistry, different from typical ground&#8208;state catalytic models. A broad range of N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;derived nucleophiles and different alkenes and esters show high compatibility with the transformation. The protocol is further applied to the concise synthesis of seven bioactive molecules from bulk materials, highlighting the reliability, generality, and practical value of the design. Mechanistic studies support the present design.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Membrane&#8208;Bound Compartment for Precise Regulation of Enzyme Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, we report a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment composed of photoisomerizable phenylazothiazole lipids and phospholipids, which enables reversible and graded regulation of enzyme activity. This biomimetic strategy operates without enzyme modification and mutagenesis, offering a versatile and biocompatible platform applicable to a broad range of enzymes.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive systems provide a powerful tool to reversibly regulate enzyme activity. However, inhibitor&#8208;based strategies, though widely used, are often restricted to specific enzymes. Noninhibitor strategies, such as enzyme surface modification or genetic mutation, often compromise structural integrity or residual activity. Inspired by the gating mechanisms of biological membranes, we reported a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment system constructed from phenylazothiazole gated lipids and phospholipids. In this design, phenylazothiazole lipids undergo reversible isomerization between trans and cis configurations under alternating purple and green light, generating continuous nanomechanical motions that transiently enhance membrane permeability. This dynamic gating behavior enables substrate diffusion across the membrane under light exposure and allows the activity of encapsulated enzymes to be switched on and off in a noninvasive, temporally defined manner. This system requires no chemical modification or mutagenesis, thus preserving the native structure and activity of encapsulated enzymes. Beyond binary regulation, precise modulation of the irradiation pattern permits graded control over enzyme activity, offering an advanced level of functional tunability. Using carbonic anhydrase, catalase, and glucose oxidase as models, we demonstrate that enzyme activity can be reversibly and quantitatively regulated via programmable light inputs. This strategy offers a broadly applicable and biocompatible platform for spatiotemporal enzyme regulation.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries through Halogen Bonding Inversion and Non&#8208;Identical&#8208;Frequency Molecular Vibrations</title>

         <dc:description>
The charge preanisotropy of ClAN forms &#963;&#8208;holes specific adsorption, which assures electron&#8208;scale manageable coordination to high valence iodine species (I+). The non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency vibrations response of ClAN with water molecules leads to rapid migration in protic solvents. The combination of the two drives the targeted coordination of the electrolyte additives to I+, breaking the reliance on the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte in conventional multi&#8208;electron transfer zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The activation of four&#8208;electron transfer behavior through I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion reactions is crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) but is hindered by the rapid hydrolysis of I+ in protic solvents. Theoretically, the directionality and modifiability of halogen bonds (XBs) can be used to regulate the hydrolytic disproportionation of I+. Given that the conventional coordination configuration is not applicable because of the locking of the XB donor (I+), the inversion of the coordination configuration to establish a charge distribution preanisotropy (&#963;&#8208;holes) and thus realize XB&#8208;stabilizing electron&#8208;scale coordination is vital for breaking down the barriers existing in protic solvents. To counteract external environmental disturbances, the cohesive energy differentiation based on the Hansen parameter creates the non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations of additives with water. Herein, an electrolyte additive (chloroacetonitrile, ClAN) with these advantages enabled the redox coupling of I&#8722;/I0/I+ at a very low salt concentration (4 molar kg&#8722;1). The corresponding ZIB exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 175.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and showed an extremely high specific capacity at high rates (133.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a generalized framework and new horizons for halogen batteries with multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Development of Indolo&#8208;Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptane as a Carbazole Isostere Through Radical Indolization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of two functional groups&#8212;isonitrile and alkene&#8212;into the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been successfully developed. This reaction offers a direct and efficient synthesis of indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a promising carbazole isostere, with high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that triplet energy transfer plays a pivotal role as a key step.








Abstract
Semisaturated ring systems with a balanced fraction of C(sp3) have garnered increasing attention in drug development. In this study, we propose indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane as a potential carbazole isostere and present a novel strategy for synthesizing this new semisaturated polycyclic scaffold. The synthesis involves using bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as radical precursors/terminators in the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction with 2&#8208;alkenylarylisocyanides, providing a highly efficient approach to construct a tricyclic system in a single step. These reactions represent a rare example of two functional groups (isonitrile and alkene) being sequentially involved in the cyclization process within BCB chemistry.

         <title>Mechanofluorochromic Elastomers Based on Reversible Helical Transition of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymeric mechanofluorochromic (MFC) mechanism is introduced, which utilizes force&#8208;induced conformational transition of the helical main chain in poly(phenylacetylene) from cis&#8208;cisoid to cis&#8208;transoid. This mechanism enables reversible fluorescence behavior, making it applicable to advanced MFC elastomers with high MFC sensitivity and superior reversibility.








Abstract
Mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials possessing both high sensitivity and excellent reversibility are crucial for achieving real&#8208;time mechanical sensing and biomedical probing. Nonetheless, it currently faces the challenge of possessing both critical properties at excellent levels. Herein, we have proposed a reversible polymer mechanochromic mechanophore utilizing a novel mechanism that enables &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence, triggered by a force&#8208;induced helical conformational transition in poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) from the fluorescent compact cis&#8208;cisoid (cc) to the non&#8208;fluorescent loose cis&#8208;transoid (ct) conformation. Upon release, the restoring force, coupled with the reformation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, drives the helical backbone to revert to cc conformation, thus enabling reversible mechanofluorochromism. A series of helical PPAs featuring vinyl groups underwent covalent crosslinking with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), yielding a range of MFC elastomers. We developed an in situ stretching&#8208;fluorescence testing device to achieve real&#8208;time monitoring of force&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By adjusting the crosslinking density, Vi&#8208;CP&#8208;0.01@PDMS&#8208;0.003 exhibited the highest MFC sensitivity. Significantly, the novel MFC elastomer showcases outstanding reversibility, maintaining its performance across 10 cycles. This study demonstrates a novel MFC mechanism that produces elastomers with high sensitivity and excellent reversibility, paving the way for further MFC materials development based on innovative mechanism.

         <title>Breaking the Performance Limit of Pure Metals for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NRR electrocatalysts suffer from low N2 concentration and competitive H2O/*H adsorption. This study proposes three&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized hollow fiber electrodes to boost NRR by elevating local N2 concentration, thereby modulating *N2 and *H coverage. The strategy demonstrates broad applicability across various metal catalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ambient&#8208;condition ammonia synthesis, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the low N2 concentration in aqueous systems and the competing strong adsorption of H2O/H intermediates on conventional bulk metal catalysts. Herein, we propose a universal micro/nanoengineering strategy to address these challenges by constructing three&#8208;phase&#8208;interface&#8208;optimized hollow fiber (HF) electrodes. This design simultaneously enhances local N2 enrichment and modulates the surface coverage of critical intermediates (*N2 versus *H), thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium toward NRR. As a proof of concept, Fe&#8208;based HF electrodes achieve a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 27.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 3.5% under ambient conditions&#8212;values dramatically enhanced by &#8764;60&#8208;fold and &#8764;35&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to planar Fe electrodes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hierarchical porous architecture of HF electrodes promotes N2 diffusion and alters the adsorption hierarchy of intermediates, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution while activating N&#8801;N bond cleavage. Crucially, this strategy demonstrates broad applicability, as evidenced by significantly improved NRR performance across diverse metals (e.g., Cu, Ni), highlighting its potential as a general platform for advancing sustainable ammonia electrosynthesis.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Reductive Regeneration on Cobalt Catalysts Enables Efficient Dual&#8208;Pathway Hydrazine Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway mechanism is unveiled for hydrazine oxidation on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and a mediated pathway involving Co(II)/Co(0) cycling. Defect engineering accelerates the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine, enabling rapid regeneration of Co(0) active site, boosting both activity and durability, and leading to efficient low&#8208;voltage hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low&#8208;energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual&#8208;pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect&#8208;rich cobalt catalyst through a one&#8208;step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only &#8722;79&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual&#8208;pathway HzOR on Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts.

         <title>Partitioning COF Membrane Channels into Ultramicroporous and &#960;&#8208;Electron&#8208;Rich Compartments for Multicomponent Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel partition has been achieved in two novel alkynyl COF membranes by using click chemistry, which results in an ultramicroporous configuration as well as concentrated charge distribution. The resultant COF membranes are capable of efficiently separating multi&#8208;cation mixtures and multi&#8208;anion mixtures.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) build a versatile platform for constructing separation membranes, affording them disruptive candidates for nanoscale molecule/ion sieving. However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual&#8208;azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich structures of triazole ring offer cation&#8208;philic or anion&#8208;repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li+/Mg2+/(K+) and F&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/(Cl&#8722;). Example of dealing with a K+/Li+/Mg2+ ternary mixture, the optimum p&#8208;TpPa&#8208;C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K+/Mg2+ and 30.9 for Li+/Mg2+. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever&#8208;reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high&#8208;performance ion separation membranes.

         <title>Quinuclidinium&#8208;Based Microporous Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microporous AEMs with extreme alkaline stability and confinement&#8208;induced high conductivity have been developed for water electrolysis. The presented membrane, poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip), exhibited high OH&#8722; conductivity and record&#8208;setting alkaline stability. The water electrolyzers configured with PTPQ&#8208;Trip can tolerate varied temperatures, current densities, alkaline concentrations, and operation interruptions, and operate continuously under high alkaline concentrations. This work promises the integration of renewable electricity for water electrolysis.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising green hydrogen production method; however, it is constrained by the moderate OH&#8722; conductivity and inadequate alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here we report a series of quinuclidinium&#8208;based AEMs with branched and microporous structures, achieving 99.95% OH&#8722; conductivity retention after 3100&#160;h in 10&#160;M NaOH at 80 &#176;C. By tuning the rigidity of the branching units to limit chain packing, micropores were created to enhance OH&#8722; transport, which improved the diffusion coefficient of OH&#8722; by 1.6 times within the poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip) membrane having the most rigid structure. An AEMWE configured with a PTPQ&#8208;Trip membrane and nickel&#8208;alloy catalysts can tolerate varied alkaline concentrations and deliver a hydrogen production current density of 2.8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;M KOH, which can be continuously operated at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 30 &#176;C for over 1200 h, with intentionally included stop/start interruptions. The assembled AEMWE demonstrated stable operation for 1400 h under alternating operational current densities and varying electrolyte temperatures. This work underscores the critical role of alkaline&#8208;resistant microporous AEMs and highlights the adaptability of AEMWE for hydrogen production using renewable electricity.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Silver Leaching from Manganese&#8211;Silver Ore Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Formation</title>

A simple&#8208;structured, cyanide&#8208;free leaching system exemplifies H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgy by dissociating lattice&#8208;confined Ag in manganese&#8211;silver ore via two&#8208;stage kinetics and forming helical AgCl chains stabilized by CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; hydrogen bonds to enable&#160;&gt;&#160;90% Ag recovery.








Abstract
Silver is an increasingly scarce resource, necessitating green leaching methods for low&#8208;grade ores. Conventional cyanidation, however, suffers from extreme toxicity and environmental hazards that make it unsustainable. We report a nontoxic synergistic leaching system based on oxalic acid and cyano&#8208;functionalized branched quaternary ammonium salts. Under mild conditions, this one&#8208;step method enables efficient and selective leaching of lattice&#8208;confined silver from polymetallic manganese&#8211;silver ore, with recoveries exceeding 90%. Kinetic studies reveal a two&#8209;stage process, with an initial rapid dissolution of exposed manganese oxides releasing silver followed by a slower breakdown of the iron matrix to liberate encapsulated minerals. The core breakthrough is the discovery that AgCl combines with chloride anions from the quaternary ammonium salt to form a unique inorganic helical chain structure. The stability of this helical assembly is attributed to an ordered CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; H&#8208;bonded network. Spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that this network undergoes an energetically favorable reconstruction that overcomes the high lattice energy of AgCl. This finding demonstrates that the cooperative effect of weak H&#8208;bonds can dissociate covalently stabilized solids. Our study thus provides an innovative strategy for sustainable silver metallurgy and introduces a new paradigm of H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgical design.

         <title>Formal C&#9472;H Functionalization of Quinolines at the C7 Position Through a Traceless Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the remote C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates has been achieved by using a traceless N&#8208;acyl directing group, providing an efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a new family of C7&#8208;functionalized quinolines with high regioselectivity.








Abstract
The precise C&#9472;H functionalization of quinolines is of high interest in organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, although many strategies have been developed for the regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization of the quinoline scaffold, the facile and selective remote C&#9472;H bond functionalization of quinolines at the geometrically and electronically disfavored C7&#8208;position has remained underdeveloped. Here, we disclose a Cu&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates. The reaction features exclusive C7&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, short reaction time, and simple operation. This practical protocol has also been applied in the analogous C7&#8208;H functionalization of tetrahydroquinolines and the further C7&#8208;elaboration of quinolines. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the key to the success of this transformation is the unique ring&#8208;size&#8208;induced in situ removal of the N&#8208;acyl directing group, constituting a traceless directing strategy for the rapid access to a variety of C7&#8208;substituted neutral quinolines.

         <dc:description>
Spillover hydrogen significantly enhances the turnover frequency of platinum single atoms, thereby enabling a nitroarene hydrogenation performance comparable to that of industrial catalyst at a low concentration of 300&#160;ppm. The Pt1/Ni@C catalyst provides new insights into the efficient screening of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.








Abstract
The application of noble single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) at trace loadings is constrained by a low space&#8208;time yield, presenting a formidable challenge in elevating the activity of SACs to be comparable to industrial catalysts in nitroarene hydrogenation. In this study, the spillover hydrogen from a carbon&#8208;coated nickel support (Ni@C) coupled with 300&#160;ppm platinum results in a 25.7&#8208;fold enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF, 44.1&#160;s&#8722;1), thereby achieving a space&#8208;time yield equivalent to 1&#160;wt.% Pd/C industrial hydrogenation catalyst. Remarkably, the Pt1/Ni@C catalyst preserves excellent stability under rigorous conditions, including acidic, basic, and oxidative environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spillover hydrogen effectively reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier, with the energy barrier height inversely correlated to the density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen on Pt single atom. Extrapolating the enhanced hydrogenation effect to other SACs and nitroarene substrates shows that spillover hydrogen can either promote or inhibit hydrogenation processes. The density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen serves as a predictive descriptor for discerning the direction of the synergistic effect in single&#8208;atom catalyzed hydrogenation. This study provides insightful guidance for the rational design of more efficient and industrially viable SACs exploiting hydrogen spillover.

         <title>Strong Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Molecules Facilitating &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking and Charge Transfer Complexes at Buried Interface and Enabling an Inverted PSC with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of 1.2&#160;V</title>

A strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule F4TCNQ is introduced to bridge MeO&#8208;2PACz and perovskite layer. F4TCNQ homogenizes the buried interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and charge&#8208;transfer complexes, passivates the defects, and promotes perovskite crystallization. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function and enhances charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high VOC of 1.202 V and robust stability.








Abstract
To improve the interfacial match between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite active layer (PAL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is introduced to bridge the self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) and PAL. F4TCNQ eliminates molecular voids in the SAMs via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, forming charge&#8208;transfer complexes that homogenize interfacial potential and promote perovskite crystallization, increasing grain size from 0.53 to 0.88&#160;&#181;m. The cyano groups and fluorine atoms on F4TCNQ passivate Pb2&#8314; and I&#8722; defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding, suppressing ion migration and carrier nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function, reducing the hole extraction barrier by 0.12&#160;eV and enhancing charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.202&#160;V, while retaining 91% efficiency after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, attributed to stabilized ion dynamics and robust interfacial adhesion. This work demonstrates molecular bridging as a scalable strategy for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics.

         <title>Solvent Chain&#8208;Length Engineering Enables All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte is designed by combining short&#8208;chain ethers for fast ion transport with long&#8208;chain glycol ethers to improve thermal and voltage stability, together with DOL and FEC additives. This strategy balances ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, thermal robustness, voltage tolerance, and low&#8208;temperature adaptability, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast charging, long cycle life, and wide&#8208;temperature operation.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;rate capability, long&#8208;term cycling stability, high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains a challenge due to intrinsic solvent trade&#8208;offs. Here, we propose a molecular&#8208;scale electrolyte design strategy addressing this multi&#8208;objective optimization through solvent chain&#8208;length engineering. By coupling short&#8208;chain ethers (low&#8208;temperature kinetics) and long&#8208;chain glycol ethers (high&#8208;voltage/thermal stability) with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), we construct a hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte that redefines Na&#8314; solvation chemistry. Systematic solvent&#8211;solvent interaction modulation weakens Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent binding to accelerate ion transport, while FEC&#8208;induced anion&#8208;rich coordination shells enhance interfacial stability. The hybrid electrolyte enables Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells to deliver an 82.75 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity after 9500 cycles at 10 C, sustain 600&#8208;day operation at 1 C, and function across &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Symmetric Na||Na cells demonstrate stable cycling for over one year. Moreover, the electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with various commercial cathode materials within a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8211;4.5&#160;V and demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in full&#8208;cell systems. This work demonstrates solvent chain&#8208;length&#8208;driven solvation engineering as a viable strategy to concurrently address kinetic, thermodynamic, and interfacial challenges, offering a practical pathway toward all&#8208;climate SIBs with balanced multi&#8208;performance metrics.

         <title>Circumventing Radical Generation on Fe&#8211;V Atomic Pair Catalyst for Robust Oxygen Reduction and Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) proceeds via direct O&#9552;O breaking pathway and thus circumvents the ROS radical generations, fundamentally enhancing ORR stability for perdurable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts are considered the most active platinum&#8208;free alternative for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) from general mechanistic pathway rapidly impair the ORR activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. Herein, we establish and report an ORR pathway&#8208;switching strategy to circumvent ROS generation and fundamentally improve the activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C via DFT guided catalyst design. The constructed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) with N2Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;VN2 configuration enables side&#8208;on adsorption of O2 and subsequent direct&#8208;breaking of the O&#9552;O bond to form O*, thereby avoiding the formation of ROS radicals. Importantly, there is intersite electron interaction between FeN4 and VN4, which further boosts the ORR activity. Consequently, Fe1V1&#8208;NC exhibits outstanding ORR activity with onset and half&#8208;wave (E1/2) potentials at 1.02 and 0.89&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, in 0.1&#160;M KOH. Record&#8208;high stability is achieved on Fe1V1&#8208;NC with a minimal decay in E1/2 by 16&#160;mV over 50000 cycles, surpassing Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C counterpart and most of the catalysts reported to date. The Fe1V1&#8208;NC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air battery reported here demonstrates exceptional durability up to 400&#160;h at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. This work identifies the intrinsic correlation between ORR pathway, activity, and stability, advancing development of stable catalytic systems.

         <title>Polyanion Electrointercalation Enables Termination&#8208;Tailored Oligolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis in Alkali Chloroaluminate Melt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile non&#8208;destructive polyanion (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;) electrointercalation strategy was developed to synthesize facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx (T&#160;=&#160;&#8722;Cl, &#8722;NH, &#8722;Br). The as&#8208;delaminated oligolayer Ti3C2Clx sheets retained their pristine features of oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination, along with long cycling performance of 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 when serving as a coating material for Zn anode.








Abstract
Tailoring surface chemistry and achieving non&#8208;destructive interlayer exfoliation are crucial for controlling MXene properties. Conventional synthesis strategies typically involve damaging intercalation processes and yield MXenes with mixed surface terminations, compromising their functionality. Herein, we propose an anodic etching strategy to produce facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx from Ti3AlC2 in low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8208;NaCl&#8208;KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti3C2Clx (MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer&#8208;induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn2+ capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non&#8208;destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.

         <title>Computational Study of Ignored Pericyclic Reactions: Rearrangements of 1,2&#8208;Bis(Diazo)Alkanes to 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazines and Subsequent Fragmentations</title>

DFT calculations of the 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkanes and of other bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles reveal that this process can establish a so far ignored route to heterocycles such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. Alternative reaction channels via carbenes or nitrenes leading to fragmentation products are discussed. The computations identified substitution patterns that could allow the characterization or isolation of the elusive 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The C2&#8208;symmetric geometries of the transition states point to a conrotatory electrocyclic process. 








Abstract
An electrocyclic ring closure of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles can afford six&#8208;membered heterocycles. This 8&#960;&#8208;electron process was systematically analyzed by DFT calculations with 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkane derivatives as possible precursor compounds and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines as products. The C2&#8208;symmetry of the transition state of the parent system points to a conrotatory ring closing event. The subsequent (6&#8211;2&#8211;2) cycloreversions of these elusive nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles to alkynes or nitriles and dinitrogen were also computationally investigated. The results show that the reactions are strongly dependent on the substitution pattern, but all are kinetically easily feasible delivering products of differing stability. The calculations can therefore provide important information for experimental endeavors to generate or even isolate so far unknown 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The feasibility of carbene or 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;substituted nitrene intermediates for the formation of alkynes is also discussed. The experimental evidence for the proposed processes is enclosed presenting literature known examples of the fragmentation reactions which can most convincingly be explained by the intermediacy of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazine derivatives. Furthermore, the electrocyclic ring closure reactions of five other types of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles are calculated, demonstrating that this so far ignored 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization&#160;process can establish a new route to interestingly composed heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Design for Enhancing Metal&#8208;Support Frontier Orbital Interaction to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on atomic structure design, this study developed AuNPsNi1CN photocatalyst, a novel structure with defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal nanoparticle loading strategies. N vacancies enhance the metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between Ni single atoms and the g&#8208;C3N4, improving H+ supply capacity through 4e&#8722; WOR. Au nanoparticles serve as 2e&#8722; ORR sites, achieving an H2O2 yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water.








Abstract
Modified g&#8208;C3N4 has been widely applied in various photocatalytic reactions. However, designing efficient atomic structures, breaking through the activity bottleneck and elucidating the precise reaction mechanisms remain the critical challenges in photocatalyst development. This work developed one innovative photocatalyst atomic structure design (AuNPsNi1CN) with Ni single atoms, N vacancies and Au nanoparticles (NPs) at g&#8208;C3N4. N vacancies enhancing metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between the Ni electron orbitals and the g&#8208;C3N4&#8217;s frontier orbitals, forming a highly active site for four&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (4e&#8722; WOR), which significantly enhanced the proton (H&#8314;) supply capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the introduced Au NPs produce H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieving a yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni single atoms cause a regulation in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), enhancing the oxidation capability of holes, while the Au NPs optimize O2 adsorption energy and lower the reaction barrier for 2e&#8722; ORR. This atomic&#8208;scale structure design strategy combining defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal NPs loading, provides a novel approach for developing efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that long&#8208;range nucleic acid&#8208;mediated electron transfer can drive Pt(IV) photoreduction, establishing a new class of metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffolds capable of &#8220;responsive uncaging,&#8221; where hybridization with target DNA or miRNA directly triggers payload release under NIR irradiation.








Abstract
Precise molecular activation with both analyte specificity and spatiotemporal control remains a major challenge in responsive diagnostics, targeted therapies, and the study of complex biological systems. Traditional photo&#8208;uncaging strategies offer excellent temporal resolution but suffer from limited tissue penetration and poor biological specificity, while analyte&#8208;responsive platforms provide molecular selectivity without external control. Here, we introduce sequence&#8208;responsive diagnostic uncaging&#8212;a unique approach that integrates nucleic acid recognition with near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered molecular activation within a metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffold. This platform is built upon a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind Pt(IV)&#8208;DNA molecular scaffold, modularly assembled via click chemistry, and integrates a Pt(IV)&#8208;caged reporter, a nucleic acid recognition domain, and an NIR antenna (e.g., IR800). Notably, DNA&#8208;mediated electron transfer (DNA&#8208;MET) provides a long&#8208;range ET pathway to direct photoreduction of the Pt(IV) centers, enabling &#8220;responsive uncaging&#8221; that occurs only upon hybridization with a fully complementary DNA or miRNA strand. Upon NIR irradiation, the duplexed nucleic acid system facilitates electron transfer from the excited antenna to Pt(IV), triggering the release of fluorescent reporters. Using two Pt(IV)&#8208;caged fluorophores (MCA and BDP), we demonstrate efficient uncaging and high sequence specificity in both solution and live cells. This platform offers a powerful and versatile photochemical tool that seamlessly bridges diagnostics and molecular activation, with broad implications for precision medicine, targeted drug delivery, and next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State and Interfacial Lock in Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers Enable Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;cable polymer extends the charge&#8208;transfer state lifetime to over 3&#160;ns, boosting the efficiency of ternary organic solar cells to 20.12%. It also serves as an interfacial lock at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, significantly enhancing device stability.








Abstract
The donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) critically govern exciton dissociation and molecular diffusion, determining both efficiency and stability. Herein, we design a double&#8208;cable conjugated polymer, SC&#8208;1F, to insert into a physically&#8208;blended D/A system to optimize the interface. We have found that SC&#8208;1F spontaneously segregates to the interface through favorable miscibility and heterogeneous nucleation with the acceptor. Its long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state with a lifetime of &gt;3&#160;ns enhances charge generation efficiency in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.00% to 20.12%. More importantly, the double&#8208;cable nature of SC&#8208;1F enables it to be simultaneously miscible with donor and acceptor so as to act as the interfacial lock to prevent their self&#8208;aggregation under thermal treatment. Therefore, the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based solar cells provided a high T80 of 2175 h compared to a T80 of 530 h based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 under 65 &#176;C treatment. Notably, SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based device demonstrates exceptional storage and thermal stability, with a T80 lifetime exceeding 10&#160;000 h. These results demonstrate the superior advantage of double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers as the third component to achieve efficient and stable OSCs.

The Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2&#8314; on surface trench&#8208;like structures of high lattice distortion MnOx, by inducing *OH generation/enrichment and electron transfer respectively, drive furoic acid (FA) dehydrogenation to carbon&#8208;centered FA radical (FA*), then reduce FA* to FA carbanion (FA&#8722;), completing Csp2&#9472;H bond activation. Under supercritical conditions (390&#160;K, 8&#160;MPa), solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 accelerates carboxylation of FA&#8722; to FDCA&#8722;, achieving 95.8% FDCA selectivity.








Abstract
Developing the efficient C&#9472;H bond activation carboxylation processes for furoic acid (FA) represents a critical technological challenge in achieving atom&#8208;economical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Despite notable advancements in this field, the inherent contradiction between the high reactivity of furan rings and the chemical inertness of C&#9472;H bonds poses substantial technical bottleneck for achieving controllable C&#9472;H carboxylation under mild conditions. Herein, we report a high lattice&#8208;distorted MnOx catalyst with surface trench&#8208;like structures, wherein the Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2+ cooperatively drive FA dehydrogenation and carbon radical reduction, inducing the free radical evolution process (FA&#8594;carbon&#8208;centered FA radical&#8594;FA carbanion), then coupled with solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 to accelerate the carboxylation process. This approach achieved an FDCA selectivity of 95.82% under mild reaction conditions (&#8804;390&#160;K), providing novel insights into mild activation and conversion of biomass&#8208;derived inert chemical bonds.

We report light&#8208;responsive &#8220;RNA photofluids&#8221; created by the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These functional liquids can harness the molecular motion of nanomachines into macroscopic, cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light.








Abstract
Incorporating artificial molecular machines into soft matter offers a compelling strategy for engineering active materials with life&#8208;like behavior. Here, we report ultraviolet and visible light&#8208;responsive RNA photofluids formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These RNA photofluids can harness the molecular motions of RNA nanomachines to produce macroscopic cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We show that the number of azobenzene moieties in the RNA nanomachines controls the deformation kinetics and critical transition temperatures between structural deformation and dissociation. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible RNA photofluids not only enable direct solar energy harvesting for light&#8208;powered soft robotics, but also expand the toolkit for developing advanced multi&#8208;responsive biomaterials and programmable artificial cells.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Optimized Film&#8208;Forming Processes Lead to Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Modules Fabricated with Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20&#8208;based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm2) and modules (19.44&#160;cm2) processed from m&#8208;xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.








Abstract
While the transition from halogenated to eco&#8208;friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6&#8208;ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non&#8208;halogenated solvent of m&#8208;xylene.

&lt;p&gt;Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6-ClTz20-based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and modules (19.44&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) processed from &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the transition from halogenated to eco-friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6-ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non-halogenated solvent of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. More importantly, Tz2Cl units induce the enlarged electrostatic potential difference between PM6-ClTz20 and the acceptor BTP-eC9, giving donor&#8211;acceptor electrostatic attraction. This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase-separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6-ClTz20:BTP-eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small-area device (0.0476&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and mini-module (19.44&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film-forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure&#8208;Engineered Proton Depletion Interfaces on Ternary RuO2 for Ultra&#8208;Stable Kilowatt Electrocatalysis</title>

Achieving kilowatt&#8208;level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self&#8208;accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.








Abstract
Advancing high&#8208;current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt&#8208;scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO2&#8208;based catalyst (Cr0.1Sn0.1Ru0.8O2) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled&#8208;up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred&#8208;ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large&#8208;scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources. Our techno&#8208;economic analysis predicts that leveraging this anode architecture can reduce hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg H2 while maintaining a substantially lower environmental footprint relative to conventional electrolyzer technologies.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Copper&#8211;Silver Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral hybrid copper&#8211;silver halide, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4, is reported as the first single&#8208;crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguide. Combining intrinsic CPL activity and low&#8208;loss light guiding, these microrods exhibit glum values of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and optical loss coefficients as low as 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1, offering a new platform for spin&#8208;photonic integration.








Abstract
Chiroptical waveguides, capable of generating and propagating circularly polarized light (CPL), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, developing novel, efficient chiroptical waveguides remains challenging, due to the difficulty of integrating strong intrinsic chiroptical activity with efficient directional light transport within a single crystalline material. Here, we report a new enantiomeric pair of chiral hybrid metal halides, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4 (S/R&#8208;CuAg), featuring a one&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure. Ag incorporation enhances photoluminescence quantum yield from 0.6% to 18.6%, while enabling bright CPL emissions with dissymmetry factors (glum) of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The tightly packed inorganic lattice and highly anisotropic microstructure of S/R&#8208;CuAg exhibit a low optical loss coefficient of 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1. Crucially, microrod crystals of S/R&#8208;CuAg function as efficient chiroptical waveguides, simultaneously emitting and propagating CPL under unpolarized light excitation. This work establishes chiral hybrid metal halides as a viable platform for circularly polarized waveguide applications.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Bridged Compact Interfacial Shielding for Practical Seawater Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte is designed using natural seawater solvent and a host&#8211;guest complex additive. The MBT guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the CD host dominated by aqueous solubility. Cl&#8722; facilitates a compact MBT shield on the Zn anode surface via bridging effect, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion.








Abstract
Substituting natural seawater (NS) for deionized water significantly reduces the electrolyte manufacturing cost of aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries, but it also poses severe corrosion challenges to the Zn metal anode, given the presence of the Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Here, a NS electrolyte featuring NS solvent and the host&#8211;guest complex additive is designed. The 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the cyclodextrin host dominated by its aqueous solubility in the NS electrolyte. Crucially, Cl&#8722; ions facilitate a compact MBT shield at the interface via bridging effects, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion and extends Zn anode cycle life. Thus, the Zn anode achieves an extended cycling life of 400&#160;h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell even under a practical depth of discharge of 42.7%. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.92 exhibits 99% capacity retention at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles, and the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an initial discharge capacity of 1.21 Ah maintains stable cycling for 50 cycles.

Leveraging hydrogen bonds (HB) and &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions, BQXTO enables a potassium&#8208;ion full cell (versus hard carbon anode) to deliver 188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy and 1331.5&#160;W kg&#8722;1 power density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature energy storage systems confront severe operational constraints due to sluggish ion kinetics and electrolyte solidification. While potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer potential for low&#8208;cost energy storage, the absence of viable cathode materials with adequate stability at ultra&#8208;low temperatures remains a critical barrier. Herein, we demonstrate an organic small molecule, 1,4&#8208;dihydrobenzo[g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,5,10&#8208;tetraone (BQXTO), in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB) and robust &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions synergistically enhance charge transfer and impart insolubility, thereby facilitating reaction kinetics and improving cycling stability even under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The assembled BQXTO||HC potassium&#8208;ion full cell achieves remarkable energy density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability (88.2% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). This study presents valuable insights into the structure design of organic small molecule cathodes for advanced low&#8208;temperature PIBs.

         <title>Allosteric Activation of Cas12a via PAM Topological Engineering for Direct and Rapid Detection of Nucleases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via PAM topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) that enables direct, rapid detection of nuclease activity without multistep conversion was developed. Upon nuclease recognition, the Y&#8208;COPE is transformed into a dsDNA activator via split PAM reconfiguration to activate Cas12a, which provides an effective pathway for straightforward and sensitive detection of nonnucleic acid targets via CRISPR&#8208;based platforms.








Abstract
A contemporary question in the intensely active field of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based molecular diagnostics is how to simplify the multistep conversion process for detecting nonnucleic acid targets. Herein we describe an allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM) topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) to achieve straightforward and diverse nuclease monitoring. The newly designed topological structure of the Y&#8208;COPE is characterized by a split PAM embedded at the three&#8208;way junction and protospacers flanking both sides. This unique spatial configuration of the PAM effectively prevents Cas12a activation. Upon target cleavage, the released truncated fragments can dynamically correct the PAM, which promptly restores the dsDNA conformation for Cas12a activation and accomplishes signal output. Theoretical calculation results revealed that, compared with the canonical dsDNA activator, in the Y&#8208;COPE, there was a 1.8&#160;&#197; increase in the center distance between Lys595 of Cas12a and the PAM, which led to a 24.2&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1 increase in binding free energy. This clearly revealed the underlying inhibition mechanism of the topological configuration of the PAM for Cas12a activation. This study advances the understanding of the dynamic response of Cas12a to topological PAM conformations and introduces the universal concept of CRISPR&#8208;based nonnucleic acid detection to benefit the next&#8208;generation molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Sterically Congested LLX&#8208;Type PNSi Tridentate Ligands for Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligands for non&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation were developed. Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) efficiently promoted the reaction in sharp contrast to an Ir/PN catalyst. The sterically congested Ir/PNSi catalysts realized steric&#8208;controlled C&#8211;H borylation. Notably, C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation of para&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes was successfully achieved in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H.








Abstract
Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) were developed as new effective catalysts for the C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of alkanes and alkyl groups that do not have directing groups. The Ir/PNSi catalysts were prepared in situ from [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 and 8&#8208;diarylphosphino&#8208;2&#8208;[(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydrosilyl)methyl]quinolines, which are readily synthesized from commercially available 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;methylquinoline. The Ir/PNSi catalyst exhibited higher chemoselectivity than a standard Ir/Me4phen and our previously reported Ir/NNSi catalysts. Thus, the Ir/PNSi catalysts promoted selective borylation of the sterically less crowded C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in 2&#8208;methylheptane and dibutyldimethylsilane. The C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds was also achieved with the Ir/PNSi catalysts in the reaction of 4&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes. Such notable chemoselectivity may be due to the congested environment around the iridium center formed by the mer&#8208;tridentate coordination of the PNSi ligands.

         <title>Continuous Flow Photocatalysis Boosting C&#9472;N Coupling for Sustainable High&#8208;Efficiency Formamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow photocatalytic platform for formamide synthesis via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of methanol and ammonia over the Pd clusters decorated TiO2 catalyst has been developed. The system has achieved a record formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 with 50 h stability in a Taylor flow reactor, which is significantly superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules.








Abstract
The construction of C&#9472;N bonds from simple precursors under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge in green chemistry, especially when it comes to avoiding energy&#8208;intensive protocols. Here, we present a continuous flow photocatalytic platform that enables the efficient coupling of C&#9472;N bonds between methanol and ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure. By synergistically engineering a Pd clusters&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst (1Pd/TiO2) and a mass transfer&#8208;enhanced gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid Taylor flow reactor, the system achieves a remarkable formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (6.83&#8208;fold enhancement compared to batch reactors) with less than 10% decay in production rate over 50 h of continuous operation, which is remarkably superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules. Distinguishing from the conventional simultaneous bimolecular one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway, a mechanistic study has shown that the precisely tailored Pd clusters on TiO2 induce charge polarization to drive methanol dehydrogenation toward critical *CH2O intermediates, enabling direct nucleophilic NH3 attack for C&#9472;N bond formation, thereby circumventing thermodynamic/kinetic barriers inherent to asynchronous radical generation in prior systems. This work establishes a paradigm for the sustainable, efficient synthesis of formamide via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling by bridging nanoscale photocatalyst engineering with macroscopic reactor design.

Ultrafine palladium phosphide (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub&#8208;2&#160;nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol








Abstract
Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defect&#8208;rich TiO2&#8208;supported Pd (Pd/d&#8208;TiO2) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d&#8208;TiO2 defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of PdxPy during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed PdxPy nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&#8722;1. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d&#8208;TiO2 (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&#8722;1) and large&#8208;sized PdxPy (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO2 (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&#8722;1). The enhanced performance of PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation&#8208;induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H2 formation. Our findings provide a novel and effective approach for the controllable synthesis of ultrafine noble metal phosphides by leveraging the defect&#8208;anchoring effect, advancing both atomic economy and selective hydrogenation catalysis.

Abstract
We report the synthesis and cooperative reactivity of a bifunctional silylene&#8211;aminoborane compound, 1&#8208;Ph&#8208;2&#8208;tBu&#8208;1H&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzazaborolyl&#8208;(amidinato)silylene (1), designed to preserve the ambiphilicity of both functional units while preventing intramolecular deactivation. 1 engages in unprecedented multicomponent activations of unsaturated bonds, including alkynes and phosphaalkynes, to construct novel main&#8208;group element embedded polycyclic frameworks. Reaction with alkynes led to rare main&#8208;group elements enriched semibullvalenes via highly regioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition. Notably, reaction with a phosphaalkyne induced a distinct SNAr&#8208;like B&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation of a B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P&#8208;embedded barrelene analogue. Structural and computational analyses revealed the synergistic multi&#8208;site activation modes and reaction pathways.

         <title>In Situ Orthogonal Chemistry for Facile Preparation of Uniform COF&#8208;Based Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs is achieved via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF within the polymer, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) represent a promising platform for advanced lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, conventional physical fabrication methods may suffer from cumbersome processing, filler agglomeration, and high interfacial resistance. Here we report the in&#8208;situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) within LMBs. Notably, the H2O generated from the polycondensation reaction effectively serves as the chain transfer agent for THF ROP, reducing the molecular weight of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) to facilitate Li+ transference, instead of corroding the lithium anode. This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF fillers within the polymer matrix, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination. Consequently, the ionic conductivity increases 80&#8208;fold (2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) with a Li+ transference number of 0.81 at room temperature. Coupled with a fluorine&#8208; and boron&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from BF3, the CPEs endow Li/LiFePO4 half batteries with excellent cycling stability. This work provides a paradigm for designing interface&#8208;compatible electrolytes through spatially controlled orthogonal synthesis.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Quaternary Ammonium Binding Motifs on Metal Nanoparticles Enable Selective Ion Transport for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic polymer ligands with positively charged head groups show a profound impact on the transport of ions and water at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface. Under negative bias, bicarbonates as counterions are preconcentrated, while extended hydrophobic polymers modulate the hydrogen bonding network among water. 








Abstract
We report a new class of hydrophobic polymer ligands with quaternary ammonium head groups for surface modification of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). Quaternary ammonium ligands bind NPs through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions, producing polymer&#8208;grafted NPs with high colloidal and chemical stability. These polymers having charged head groups offer powerful strategies to tailor the structure and function of metal&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in electrocatalytic systems. The ammonium head groups serve as ionic reservoirs that preconcentrate bicarbonate counterions at the surface of nanocatalysts, while the hydrophobic polymer backbones restructure local hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, modulating water and ion transport dynamics. These interfacial effects promote CO2 electroreduction, particularly under diffusion&#8208;limited conditions, resulting in a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%.

         <title>Gradient Polarization Induces Three&#8208;Dimensional Asymmetric Electron Distribution in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation</title>

Gradient polarization induces a 3D asymmetric charge distribution and built&#8208;in electric field, thereby achieving efficient in&#8208;plane/interlayer charge transfer and N2 fixation. Moreover&#65292;the generated polarized confined microenvironment stabilizes intermediates, achieving high NH4+ and NO3&#8722; yields.








Abstract
Constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, yet the spatial conformation imposes inherent trade&#8208;offs between in&#8208;plane and interplane carrier transport. Here, we present a spatial gradient polarization strategy that combines distinct electronegativities of (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups in COFs to establish a 3D asymmetric electron distribution and the gradient polarization. Mechanistic studies have shown that the gradient polarization triggers the interlayer dipole rearrangement in a nonpolar orientation, thereby constructing a cooperative in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization field. This polarization field decouples the constraints on carrier transport and drives rapid charge transfer in an anisotropic manner, breaking the traditional perception of D&#8208;A intramolecular polarization within the plane. Moreover, the resulting polarized microenvironment activates N&#8801;N bonds, optimizes hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, and stabilizes reaction intermediates, enabling the sequential conversion pathway of nitrogen. Ultimately, the covalent organic framework containing (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups (SBO) exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance with yields of NH4+ and NO3&#8722; of 11.59 and 7.18&#160;mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing all reported systems. Additionally, under natural sunlight, SBO also achieves unprecedented NH4+ (87.17&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (73.63&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) yields. Our research not only offers a strategic blueprint for modulating the 3D polarization in COFs but also bridges the gap in the relationship between the molecular structure of materials and the spatial carrier migration.

         <title>Alloying Small&#8208;Cation into Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Motif Gives Multiaxial Ferroelectrics with Enhanced Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a series of multiaxial bismuth&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics with organic mixed&#8208;cations, of which the most active candidate enables the photocurrent enhancement ratio reaches up to 4800%, far beyond those known ferroelectrics. This work affords a new avenue for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photoactive ferroelectrics have shown huge potentials for assembling high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Bismuth&#8208;based halides are emerging as a vigor ferroelectric subclass due to unique structural diversity and flexibility, while studies on their photo&#8208;ferroelectricity coupling remain extremely scarce. Here, we have alloyed organic mixed&#8208;cations into Bismuth&#8208;based prototype to design a series of new multiaxial ferroelectrics with strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity, as notably exemplified by (BZA)2(DMA)BiBr6 (1, where BZA is benzylammonium; DMA is dimethylammonium). The dynamic motions of small DMA+ cation afford the driving force to trigger symmetry breaking of 3&#175;mFm$\bar 3m{\rm F}m $, thus giving its multiaxial ferroelectricity with 6 equivalent polarization directions. Strikingly, 1 exhibits photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a broad ultraviolet&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral range (266&#8211;980&#160;nm), which couples with ferroelectric bulk photovoltaics to create giant photocurrent enhancement ratio of &#8764;4800%. This merit far surpasses those of known ferroelectric materials. These results shed light on the design of new photoactive ferroelectric candidates for smart photoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Reduction of Rare&#8208;Earth Stannole Sandwich Complexes to Tin&#8208;Based Radical Ligands and Tin&#8211;Tin Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

One&#8208;electron reduction of dimetallic rare&#8208;earth stannole complexes with KC8 produces a di&#8208;tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two&#8208;electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M2Sn2} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.








Abstract
f&#8208;Element organometallic chemistry is dominated by cyclopentadienyl ligands. In contrast, isoelectronic metallole ligands with the general formula [EC4R4]2&#8722;, where E is a heavier group 14 element, are rare in the f&#8208;block, particularly stannole ligands. Here, we describe the synthesis of the dimetallic stannole complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M&#160;; M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy; CpSn = [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt = [1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2]&#8722;), which form by virtue of Sn&#8594;M dative bonds. One&#8208;electron reduction of 1M with KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces the mono&#8208;anionic complexes [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M), and two&#8208;electron reduction gives di&#8208;anionic [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M) as [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts. Studies of the stannole complexes using crystallography, UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy, magnetometry and computational methods reveal that the reduction steps generate tin&#8211;tin bonds through population of a delocalized molecular orbital that spans the {M2Sn2} rings, with attendant dearomatization of the stannole rings. Complexes 2M are the first tin&#8208;radical ligands bound to rare earth elements. Spin density calculations of 2Y and 2Gd reveal significant build&#8208;up of unpaired spin on the tin atoms, with magnetic measurements on 2Gd yielding an unprecedentedly large tin&#8211;gadolinium exchange coupling constant of &#8722;112&#160;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2J formalism).

         <title>K+ Vacancies and Fluorine Substitution Synergistically Regulate KTiOPO4 Anode for All&#8208;Climate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K+ vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full&#8208;cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Although Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO4 (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K+ vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites.

&lt;p&gt;A Ti-based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full-cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all-climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Ti-based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal-ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites. The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The synergistic effect of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Practical full-cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all-climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity of a Phosphinidene Telluride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis and isolation of a phosphinidene telluride. This species acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer reagent accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium.








Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphorus(III) telluride is reported. The compound was accessed by means of a double bond metathesis reaction between an amido&#8208;functionalized phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP&#9552;O (Ar&#160;=&#160;bulky aryl substituent), with a silylene telluride, L(NMe2)Si&#9552;Te (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2). The resulting phosphinidene telluride, BnArNP&#9552;Te, exhibits a short P&#9552;Te bond (2.297(1) &#197;), resulting from a significant p&#960;&#8211;p&#960; orbital interaction between the phosphorus(III) and tellurium(&#8722;II) atoms. Key to the stabilization of this compound is the amido substituent associated with the phosphorus atom, which provides kinetic stabilization due to its steric bulk but also significant thermodynamic stabilization through negative hyperconjugation of the nitrogen atom lone pair into antibonding orbital interactions between phosphorus and tellurium. The title compound acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer platform, accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium to afford other phosphorus(III) compounds via transient phosphorus(V) intermediates.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Driven Conformational Switching of Binaphthalene&#8208;Based Tetraimidazolium Macrocycles to Enhance Sequence&#8208;Selective Recognition of Dinucleotides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media using binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycle as artificial host is reported. The macrocycle undergoes reversible conformational switching with temperature, transitioning from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;conformation. This temperature&#8208;driven switching enhances binding with d(TpA) and achieves high sequence selectivity (Krel &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K) in water, demonstrating its potential for developing temperature&#8208;sensing optical devices for detecting DNA or RNA fragments with specific nucleotide sequences.








Abstract
Developing artificial hosts with temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching behaviors facilitates our understanding of the temperature&#8208;dependent allostery and adaptation mechanisms in natural recognition systems. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of three pairs of water&#8208;soluble, enantiomeric binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycles (SS/RR&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; &#8211; SS/RR&#8208;3&#8226;4Cl&#713;) as artificial hosts for exploring sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media. Owing to the reversible rotational conformation of axially chiral binaphthyl units, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; demonstrates the conformational switching, converting from cis&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1cis) to trans&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1trans) by increasing temperature, thereby causing the recognition cavity to transition from a closed to an open state. Given its ability for temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; exhibits temperature&#8208;cooperative enhanced binding behavior with d(TpA), with association constants (Ka) increasing to &#8764;106&#160;M&#8722;1 at 323&#160;K, up from &#8764;104&#160;M&#8722;1 at 288&#160;K. In contrast, its affinity for other dinucleotides, including d(ApT), d(GpC), and d(CpG), decreases to varying extents with increasing temperature. As a result, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713;, with an ability of temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, achieves an unexpected sequence&#8208;selective recognition for the sequence&#8208;complementary dinucleotide pair d(TpA) and d(ApT), with high sequence selectivity factors (Krel&#160;=&#160;Ka[d(TpA)]/Ka[d(ApT)]) reaching up to &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K, in water.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Anisotropic Grain Growth in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic grain growth during sintering is characterized by an initial preference for the [104] and [110] directions, followed by accelerated growth along the [003] orientation. Low&#8208;valence dopants (Mg2+/Al3+) facilitate grain boundary migration (n&#160;about 2), while high&#8208;valence ions (Mo6+) suppress the behavior via segregation (n&#160; about 4.5), enhancing cycling stability.








Abstract
The particle morphology governed by anisotropic grain growth of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes plays a crucial role in electrochemical stability and can be tuned via element doping during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. However, the fundamental impact of dopants on the anisotropic grain growth kinetics remains unclear. Herein, this work systematically investigates how dopants with different valences (Mg2+, Al3+, Zr4+, Ta5+, and Mo6+) affect the anisotropic grain growth during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. The findings demonstrate that the grain growth rate along the [104] and [110] directions is initially faster, followed by a higher growth rate along the [003] direction. The coarsening exponents n for the grain growth (along the [003], [104], and [110] directions) with low&#8208;valence ions (Mg2+, Al3+) dopants are approximately equal to 2, indicating that the grain growth depends solely on short&#8208;range diffusion at the grain boundary. Interestingly, the n value along the [003] direction enlarges with an increase in valence. Notably, the higher valence of Mo6+ results in a significant elevation of the exponent n along the [003] direction to 4.5, indicating a strong pinning effect due to Mo6+ segregation at the grain boundary. This pinning impedes grain boundary migration, inhibits grain coarsening, and effectively enhances cycle stability.

         <title>A Heterodimetallic Monomeric Complex with a Uranium&#8211;Cobalt Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a crystallographically confirmed heterodimetallic monomeric complex (TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co) featuring a U&#8801;Co triple bond (2.189&#160;&#197;). Remarkably, this complex could act as a catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkyne.








Abstract
The crystal structure of heterodimetallic monomeric complexes featuring a U&#8211;M triple bond has been rarely reported. Here, we present an example of a heterodimetallic monomeric complex [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co)] (4) containing a U&#8211;Co triple bond, which was synthesized by the reaction of [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Cl)] (2) or [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U] (3) with CoCl2 in the presence of KC8. The crystal structure of 4 reveals a highly&#160;symmetrical&#160;geometry with a linear Co&#8211;U&#8211;Namine axis line, and the U&#8211;Co bond length 2.1890(11) &#197; is slightly longer than the sum of the covalent triple&#8208;bond radii of uranium and cobalt (2.14&#160;&#197;). The U&#8211;Namine bond length (2.439(6) &#197;) is significantly shortened compared to that of precursors 2 and 3. The significant contraction of the U&#8211;Namine bond demonstrates electronic reinforcement via the inverse trans&#8208;influence (ITI). Detailed computational investigations further support the existence of a U&#8801;Co triple bond in 4, and the formal oxidation states of uranium and cobalt appear to be U(IV) and Co(&#8208;I). The low&#8208;temperature magnetic moments of 4 are approaching 2.1 &#956;B, which is attributed to its near&#8208;doubly degenerate spin&#8208;orbit ground states in the pseudo&#8208;C3v symmetry. Remarkably, 4 served as the catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkynes under mild conditions.

         <title>Strengthening Intermediate Adsorption on a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Assembly by Polymeric Modification for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction into Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

Poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) modification of cobalt phthalocyanine nanotubes boosts electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol by 14&#8208;fold enhancement of turnover frequency. The pyridyl groups axially coordinate to cobalt centers, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediate to decreased the reaction barrier.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) to generate value added methanol (MeOH) in water has been considered as a potential strategy to realize efficient carbon cycle and reutilization. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) represents as a classical molecular catalyst carrying precisely tunable active sites, which has been widely explored for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH conversion, but optimization of performance is suffering from relatively easiness in desorption of *CO intermediate. To this end, we developed a novel molecular assembly of CoPc nanotubes (CoT) driven by van der Waals force with surface being modified by poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). The as&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance of MeOH production for the turnover frequency enhanced by more than 14&#8208;fold compared to the pristine CoT, and the Faradaic efficiency is up to 40% at a moderate potential. It revealed that the pyridyl groups of P4VP axially coordinated with the Co catalytic centers shifted the d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediates, thereby decreasing the whole barrier to produce MeOH. This work demonstrates a novel insight into intermediate manipulation of CO2R and highlights the potential of molecular electrocatalysis for carbon valorization.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;photon Absorption Switch via Cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;Salt&#8208;to&#8208;Cocrystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation, we construct for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch between upconversion and Stokes emission. This single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) interconvert for 20 cycles, demonstrating an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials, which holds promising applications in display devices and rewritable information storage.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive organic cocrystals are typically governed by single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation, remaining a long&#8208;standing challenge due to disruption of long&#8208;range order structure throughout the whole solid&#8208;state process. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch based on reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal SCSC transformation. While both para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene and meta&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene coassemble with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) into cocrystals via donor&#8211;acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonds, only the former cocrystal exhibits broad&#8208;window TPA activity alongside enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Theoretical calculations confirm that positional isomerism of electron donors modulates molecular coplanarity and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in cocrystals, directly controlling TPA cross&#8208;sections. Remarkably, para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene undergoes diprotonation by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid, enabling the conversion of the cocrystal to a salt form, which can be reverted upon triethylamine treatment. This cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation switches the TPA characteristics with reversible color changes between upconversion orange emission and Stokes yellow luminescence for 20 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials. Based on the unique acid&#8208;responsive emission, we also apply the SCSC transformation in display devices and information storage. This study elucidates structure&#8208;property relationships governing TPA in cocrystals and establishes a new paradigm for stimuli&#8208;responsive optical switches.

         <title>Programmable Bio&#8208;Derived Noncovalent Glass via Reconfigurable H&#8208;Bonding Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

This work demonstrates a programmable glass via reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks between natural biomolecules and organic acids, redefining glass as an active material medium with encoded structural logic. The strategy expands the frontiers of glass chemistry toward sustainable electronics, transient architectures, and environmentally adaptive materials.








Abstract
Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next&#8208;generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio&#8208;derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four&#8208;dimensional control: hydration&#8208;tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid&#8208;guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature&#8208;activated self&#8208;healing, and closed&#8208;loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus&#8211;response modes. Critically, the configurability of H&#8208;bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold&#8208;casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to energy&#8208;intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging&#8212;transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Polyethylene via Radical Copolymerization of Ethylene with Alkenyl Boronate and Post&#8208;Polymerization Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized novel hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene via radical copolymerization of ethylene with isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester, followed by oxidation of the boron pendant. Kinetic studies and product analyses suggested that the hydroxy group could be uniformly introduced into a moderately branched PE backbone (i.e., medium density) to achieve unique poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl vinyl alcohol) exhibiting 41% crystallinity. 








Abstract
Radical copolymerization of ethylene was performed with alkenyl boronate, and post&#8208;polymerization oxidation was conducted to synthesize hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene (PE). The copolymerization behavior was dependent on the molecular structure of the boron monomer: the copolymerization with &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted monomer carrying boronic acid pinacol ester [isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester (IPBpin)] afforded copolymers with higher molar masses than the vinyl&#8208;type monomer [i.e., vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin)]. The content of the boron&#8208;pendant units was up to 7 mol%, and kinetic studies suggested the incorporation of boron&#8208;pendant units in a discrete manner. The post&#8208;polymerization oxidation of the boron pendants on the copolymer proceeded quantitatively, affording a hydroxy&#8208;containing polyethylene. The introduction of a hydroxy group had a significant impact on the crystallization behaviors.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Visualisation of Reaction Kinetics and Dynamics: Single&#8208;Molecule Insights into the Iminium&#8208;Catalysed Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Optical microscopy is commonly used to observe simple turn&#8208;on/off phenomena in chemical reactions. A method is presented for the real&#8208;time monitoring of diverse reaction pathways at the single&#8208;molecule level using optical microscopy. This technique enables detailed kinetic and dynamic studies to be performed, providing new insights into catalyst design and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Investigation of the fundamental microscopic processes occurring in organic reactions is essential for optimising both organocatalysts and synthetic strategies. In this study, single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was employed to study the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction catalysed by a first&#8208;generation MacMillan catalyst, providing direct insights into its kinetic dynamics. This reaction proceeds via a series of reversible processes under equilibrium conditions (S &#8644; IM1 &#8644; IM2 &#8594; P, IM1 and IM2: N,O&#8208;acetal and iminium ion intermediates, respectively). The individual reaction trajectories of single molecules were directly observed in real&#8208;time, and the kinetic transitions between the different states were quantitatively analysed using a hidden Markov model, thereby enabling precise determination of the kinetic rate constants and transition probabilities at the single&#8208;molecule level. In particular, the unique structural features of the MacMillan catalyst were probed to reveal how specific interactions stabilise the reaction intermediates and influence their kinetic behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of organic reactions and guiding the rational design of more effective catalysts.

         <title>Evolution of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters with Intrinsic Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich excited&#8208;state dynamics of intrinsically chiral silver nanoclusters tethering cationic species on the surface demonstrates the excited&#8208;state dependent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), suggesting the temporal evolution of exciton distribution.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is a powerful tool to probe the chiroptical properties of molecular systems in the excited state. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of excited&#8208;state chiroptical property in silver nanoclusters (NCs) by CPL measurements. The use of bidentate thiolate ligand, 1,3&#8208;benzenedithiol (BDT), with the aid of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), affords racemic [Ag29(BDT)12(PPh3)4]3&#8722; NCs (Ag29 NCs) with intrinsic chirality in the exterior cage composed of a silver(I)&#8208;dithiolate coordination framework, that are separable by chiral column chromatography. We have recently reported that the post&#8208;synthetic modification of negatively charged Ag29 NCs with a cationic silver(I) complex on the exterior cage stabilizes a specific excited state with a triplet character, enhancing photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. While the same modification on the separated enantiomeric NCs does not change the circular dichroism (CD) profile so much, the CPL activity is dramatically enhanced with an increase in the anisotropy factor (|glum| value) from &lt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 to 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, demonstrating the excited&#8208;state dependent CPL property of Ag29 NCs. In combination with the picosecond PL decay study, the low&#8208;temperature CPL measurement indicates the time development of excited&#8208;state property, suggesting the possible evolution of CPL activity.

         <title>3D Gas Diffusion Layer with Dual&#8208;Metal Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE, achieving a remarkable FEC2+ of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE with a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The chitosan&#8208;induced 3D structure enhances CO2 accessibility, while DFT simulation reveal the tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#8208;Ag dual sites&#8212;Cu activates CO2 into CO* and Ag promotes CHO* formation, enabling asymmetric coupling for C2+ products.








Abstract
Achieving satisfactory C2+ products selectivity and current density in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) remains a challenge for the practical applications. Here, we design a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products, which shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE and a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the chitosan with multiple functional groups induces the formation of 3D architecture, which enhances the accessibility of reactive sites and mitigates the limitations associated with CO2 diffusion. The abundant hydrogen bonds between chitosan and CO2 promote the adsorption and enrichment of reactant. Furthermore, the Cu site exhibits stronger activation capacity for CO2 and facilitates the subsequent electron transfer process for the formation of intermediate *CO. The DFT simulation also reveals the thermodynamic favorable for *CO migrating from Cu site to Ag site. Moreover, the Ag site exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy for the protonation of *CO to *CHO, which facilitates the asymmetric coupling of *CO (Cu site) and *CHO (Ag site), ultimately enhancing the generation of C2+ products. Consequently, the unique 3D structure and tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#9472;Ag dual sites achieves high activity for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of In2O3 Using in Situ Raman Spectroscopy: Bridging Material Dynamics and Sensor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 (cubic/rhombohedral) homojunctions are designed for room&#8208;temperature NO2 sensing, achieving an ultrahigh response (1208 to 5&#160;ppm). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals reversible phase transitions, identifying rhombohedral In2O3 as the dominant active phase for NO2 interaction. This real&#8208;time structural analysis directly correlates phase dynamics with sensor response, resolving a key uncertainty in MOS sensing mechanisms. 








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors still face the critical challenge of high operating temperatures. While material engineering strategies have enabled room&#8208;temperature operation, the dynamic evolution of active phases during sensing&#8212;a key factor governing structure&#8208;activity relationships&#8212;remains poorly understood due to the lack of real&#8208;time characterization techniques. Here, we design phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 homojunctions (cubic/rhombohedral) via graphene&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis and demonstrate their exceptional NO2 sensing performance at room temperature. The optimized In2O3/graphene (In2O3/G) hybrid exhibits a 20&#8208;fold enhancement in response (1208 versus 58 for pure In2O3 at 5&#160;ppm NO2), achieving ultrahigh sensitivity with minimal power consumption. By employing in situ Raman spectroscopy to probe structural dynamics during gas exposure, we identify a reversible phase transition between cubic and rhombohedral In2O3, with the rhombohedral phase acting as the dominant active site for NO2 adsorption/desorption. This real&#8208;time observation of phase&#8208;dependent reactivity establishes a direct correlation between transient structural changes and sensor response, resolving a long&#8208;standing ambiguity in MOS&#8208;based sensing mechanisms. Our findings not only pinpoint the active phase but also provide a generalizable methodology to bridge nanoscale material dynamics with macroscopic device functionality, paving the way for rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors.

         <title>Steering Amide Synthesis from Acetonitrile by Electrochemically Derived Active Superoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectively formed in situ superoxide radicals, &#8226;&#9472;O2&#8722; via oxygen electroreduction are highly active for amide bond formation to synthesize acetamide from acetonitrile with 94% selectivity under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Amides with unique carbonyl&#8208;nitrogen linkage are fundamental functional groups that are active and essential for a wide range of natural and synthetic products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and key intermediates. Amide bond formation is one of the most fundamental reactions in chemistry. Conventional amide synthesis faces challenges of poor atom economy and reliance on hazardous reagents. Herein, we present a tandem electro&#8208;thermal catalytic pathway for the synthesis of acetamide from acetonitrile, leveraging electrochemically generated superoxide radicals to steer oxygen insertion under ambient conditions. The superoxide radicals were formed via controlled electroreduction of molecular oxygen. In 1&#160;M K2CO3 electrolyte containing methanol, we achieved over 94% selectivity toward acetamide at a total current density up to 104&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a productivity of 878&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies reveal that the superoxide radicals stabilized by a buffered alkaline environment facilitated the nucleophilic C&#9472;O coupling at the nitrile group, while the presence of methanol quenched the hydroxyl radicals and effectively suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of acetamide to acetate. This coupled electro&#8208;thermal catalysis enables the synthesis of a large variety of amides and may inspire more complex organic synthesis through active oxygen species&#8208;mediated process.

         <title>From Solvent to Catalyst: In Situ Amino Acid&#8208;Like Species Enable PET Upcycling Without Added Catalysts</title>

Amino acid logic meets solvent design: A bioinspired strategy leveraging the acid&#8208;base synergistic catalysis of in situ&#8208;generated amino acid&#8211;like species from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) enables external catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization of waste polyesters into valuable carboxylates and ethylene carbonate.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a promising route to value&#8208;added chemical production, yet conventional methods typically demand harsh conditions and dedicated catalysts. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy that exploits the intramolecular acid&#8208;base synergy of amino acids for efficient PET depolymerization. Alanine functions as a bifunctional organocatalyst, enabling complete PET esterolysis by dimethyl carbonate within 3&#160;h at 180 &#176;C to afford dimethyl terephthalate (98%) and ethylene carbonate (80%). Extending this concept, trace water in N&#8208;methyl &#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone induces in situ generation of 4&#8208;(methylamino)butyric acid, which emulates amino acid bifunctionality and enables catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an intramolecular dual&#8208;site acid&#8208;base mechanism, where &#8211;COO&#8722; and &#8211;NH2&#8314;&#160;groups cooperatively activate methanol and PET carbonyls through hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic transition states, lowering the barrier by &#8764;29&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1. The method extends broadly to polyesters and polycarbonate, while establishing a transferable design paradigm that translates catalytic principles from nature into organocatalyst and solvent design, underscoring solvent molecular design as a general lever for sustainable catalysis and plastic upcycling.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterovalent Alloying Hybrid Double Perovskite Solid Solution for Elevating Ferroelastic Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we constructed a novel family of intrinsic hybrid double perovskite solid solutions, which greatly enhances and expands the photoelectric response across the entire visible light range.








Abstract
Hybrid double perovskites (HDPs), as the main candidates for lead&#8208;free materials, have attracted great attention in the construction of ferroelectrics, ferroelastics, and high&#8208;efficiency photodetectors. However, the photoelectronic performance of HDPs, including bandgap and carrier transport efficiency, is still far behind compared to lead&#8208;based analogues. Excavate effective strategies to bridge this gap has always been an ongoing challenge. Herein, for the first time, we present a family of intrinsic solid solution based on heterovalent metal ions of HDPs, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)X8 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Such solid solution effectively improves the structural stacking mode, and thereby not only inducing 4/mmmF2/m type ferroelastic phase transition but also making a narrower optical bandgap (&#8764;1.74&#160;eV) of (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 lower than that of HDP counterparts. Benefiting from the collaborative overlap of wide absorption range and promoting effect ferroelastic domains on carrier transport, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 exhibits a photocurrent switching ratio (Ion/Ioff) greater than 100 and photoelectric response across the entire UV&#8211;vis range. In short, this work provides a new perspective for improving the physical performance of HDPs.
