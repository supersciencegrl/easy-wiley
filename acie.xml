      <title>Hydrothermally stable irreducible oxide&#8208;modified Pd/MgAl2O4 catalyst for methane combustion</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic combustion is promising in removing trace amount of CH4 to address serious environmental concerns. Supported Pd based catalysts are most effective but often suffer from low stability in practice application due to the water vapor induced sintering.

      <title>Spherical Supramolecular Structures Constructed via Chemically Symmetric Perylene Bisimides: Beyond Columnar Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Like other discotic molecules, self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures of perylene bisimides (PBIs) are commonly limited to columnar or lamellar structures due to their distinct &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds and unique rectangular shape of perylene cores.

Herein, we report a series of unconventional spherical packing phases in PBIs including A15 phase, &#963; phase, dodecagonal quasicrystalline (DQC) phase, and body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) phase. By the functionalization of perylene core with several polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cages, our strategy successfully achieves spherical assemblies of PBIs, instead of columnar assemblies, due to the significantly increased steric hindrance at the periphery. This strategy may also be employed for the discovery of unconventional spherical assemblies in other related discotic molecules by the introduction of similar bulky functional groups at their periphery. In addition, an unusual inverse phase transition sequence from BCC phase to &#963; phase by increasing annealing temperature is observed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>While halogenation is of key importance in synthesis and radioimaging, the currently available repertoire is largely designed to introduce a single halogen per molecule. This report makes the selective introduction of several different halogens accessible. We showcase the privileged stability of non&#8208;toxic aryl germanes under harsh fluorination conditions (that allow for selective fluorination in their presence), while displaying superior reactivity and functional group tolerance in electrophilic iodinations and brominations, outcompeting silanes or boronic esters under rapid and additive&#8208;free conditions.

      <title>Guest&#8208;Responsive Reversible Electron Transfer in a Crystalline Porous Framework Supported by Dynamic Building Node</title>
      <dc:description>Spatial organization of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) supramolecular assembly is critical to the photophysical processes involved in solar energy conversion systems. Subtle variation in geometry, i.e. D&#8208;A distance and transition dipole arrangement can influence kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer (ET) process.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial organization of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) supramolecular assembly is critical to the photophysical processes involved in solar energy conversion systems. Subtle variation in geometry, i.e. D&#8208;A distance and transition dipole arrangement can influence kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer (ET) process. To acquire an insight into the structure&#8208;function correlation, making of modular, crystalline materials is advantageous. In this regard, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;active, crystalline D&#8208;A assembly, in which ET process can be reversibly switched.

      <title>Universal Access to Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Heterostructures via Micelle&#8208;Directed Interfacial Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous heterostructures combining ultrathin nanosheet morphology, periodic porous surface structures and diverse hybrid compositions have recently emerged and become increasingly important for renewable energy storage and electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to develop a universal method to prepare 2D mesoporous heterostructures. Here, we report a composite micelle&#8208;directed interfacial assembly method to synthesize vertical heterostructures with ultrathin 2D material and two surrounding mesoporous monolayers assembled on both sides. To demonstrate the concept, we first fabricate a new sandwich&#8208;like carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructure through self&#8208;assembly of MXene nanosheets and block copolymer F127/melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin composite micelles as well as a subsequent thermal treatment. We also show that this approach can be applied to other 2D materials (for example, graphene oxide, potassium niobate nanosheets, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Finally, we demonstrate that the carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructured nanosheets manifest remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance as cathode for lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergy of Electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in the Realization of Nanoscale Artificial Photosynthetic Model Systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the scientific race to build up photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems with increasing efficiencies, little is known about the interplay of their building blocks when integrated into supramolecular nanoscale arrays, particularly in aqueous environments. Here, we describe an aqueous donor&#8208;acceptor ensemble whose emergence as a nanoscale material renders it remarkably stable and efficient. We have focused on a tetracationic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) featuring pyrenes, which shows an unprecedented mode of aggregation, driven by subtle cooperation between electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our studies demonstrate monocrystalline growth in solution and a symmetry&#8208;breaking intermolecular charge transfer between adjacent ZnPcs upon photoexcitation. Immobilizing a negatively charged fullerene (C  60  ) as electron acceptor onto the monocrystalline ZnPc assemblies was found to enhance the overall stability, and to suppress the energy&#8208;wasting charge recombination found in the absence of C  60  . Overall, the resulting artificial photosynthetic model system exhibits a high degree of preorganization, which facilitates efficient charge separation and subsequent charge transport.</dc:description>

      <title>Expanded Analogs of Three&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Halide Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Replacing the Pb&#8211;X octahedral building unit of A  I  PbX  3  perovskites (X = halide) with a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Pb&#8211;X octahedra affords the expanded perovskite analogs: A  II  Pb  2  X  6  . We report eight members of this new family of materials. In 3D hybrid perovskites, orbitals from the organic molecules do not participate in the band edges. In contrast, the more spacious inorganic sublattice of the expanded analogs accommodates larger pyrizinium&#8208;based cations with low&#8208;lying &#960;* orbitals that form the conduction band, substantially decreasing the expanded lattice&#8217;s bandgap. The molecular nature of the conduction band allows us to electronically dope the materials by reducing the organic molecules. By synthesizing derivatives with A  II  = pyridinium and ammonium, we can isolate the contributions of the pyrazinium&#8208;based orbitals in the bandgap transition of A  II  Pb  2  X  6  . The organic&#8208;molecule&#8208;based conduction band and the inorganic&#8208;ion&#8208;based valence band provide an unusual electronic platform with localized states for electrons and more disperse bands for holes upon optical or thermal excitation.</dc:description>

In contrast, the more spacious inorganic sublattice of the expanded analogs accommodates larger pyrizinium&#8208;based cations with low&#8208;lying &#960;* orbitals that form the conduction band, substantially decreasing the expanded lattice&#8217;s bandgap. The molecular nature of the conduction band allows us to electronically dope the materials by reducing the organic molecules. By synthesizing derivatives with A  II  = pyridinium and ammonium, we can isolate the contributions of the pyrazinium&#8208;based orbitals in the bandgap transition of A  II  Pb  2  X  6  . The organic&#8208;molecule&#8208;based conduction band and the inorganic&#8208;ion&#8208;based valence band provide an unusual electronic platform with localized states for electrons and more disperse bands for holes upon optical or thermal excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Atomic Insights into Aluminium&#8208;Ion Insertion in Defective Anatase for Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aluminium batteries constitute a safe and sustainable high&#8211;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy&#8208;storage solution. Viable Al&#8208;ion batteries require suitable electrode materials that can readily intercalate high&#8208;charge Al  3+  ions. Here, we investigate the Al  3+  intercalation chemistry of anatase TiO  2  and how chemical modifications influence the accommodation of Al  3+  ions. We use fluoride&#8208; and hydroxide&#8208;doping to generate high concentrations of titanium vacancies. The coexistence of these hetero&#8208;anions and titanium vacancies leads to a complex insertion mechanism, attributed to three distinct types of host sites: native interstitials sites, single vacancy sites, and paired vacancy sites. We demonstrate that Al  3+  induces a strong local distortion within the modified TiO  2  structure, which affects the insertion properties of the neighbouring host sites. Overall, specific structural features induced by the intercalation of highly&#8208;polarizing Al  3+  ions should be considered when designing new electrode materials for multivalent batteries.</dc:description>

Synergetic second order Jahn&#8208;Teller effect supported by first principle calculations, anion order and electrostatic repulsion between W6+ cations induce large distortions at two inequivalent face sharing octahedra that lead to long&#8208;range ordered dipoles and spontaneous polarization along the c axis.

      <title>Peptide&#8208;conjugated long&#8208;lived theranostic imaging toolbox for targeting GRPr in cancer and immune cells</title>
      <dc:description>Gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) plays proliferative and inflammatory roles in living systems. Here, we report a highly selective GRPr antagonist (JMV594)&#8208;tethered iridium(III) complex for probing GRPr in living cancer cells and immune cells. This probe not only exhibited desirable photophysical properties, but also displayed negligible cytotoxicity, overcoming the inherent toxicity of the iridium(III) complex. In particular, its long emission lifetime enabled its luminescence signal to be readily distinguished from the interfering fluorescence of organic dyes by using a time&#8208;resolved technique. This probe selectively visualized living cancer cells via specific binding to GRPr, while it also modulated the function of GRPr on TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion in immune cells. To our knowledge, this is the first peptide&#8208;conjugated iridium(III) complex developed as a GRPr bioimaging probe and modulator of GRPr activity.

      <title>Titanium defective sites in TS&#8208;1: structural insights by combining spectroscopy and simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Ti silicates, and in particular Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1), are nowadays important catalysts for several partial oxidation reactions in the presence of aqueous H  2  O  2  as oxidant.

In particular, the structure and the catalytic role of defective Ti sites, other than perfect tetrahedral sites recognized as main active species, has not been quantitatively discussed in the literature. In this work, we assess the structural features of defective Ti sites on the basis of electronic spectroscopies outcomes, as interpreted through quantum&#8208;mechanical simulation.

      <title>An Ultrastable, Small {Ag7}5+ Nanocluster within a Triangular Hollow Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
You got the silver: An ultrastable, small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster was synthesized within an unprecedented triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible&#8208; and UV&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Small Agn nanoclusters (n&lt;10) have been emerging as promising materials as sensing, biolabeling, and catalysis because of their unique electronic states and optical properties. However, studying synthesis, structure determination, and exploration of their properties remain major challenges as a result of the low stability of small Ag nanoclusters. Herein, we synthesized an atomically precise face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic&#8208;type small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster supported by a novel triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible and UV light regions. Furthermore, this small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster exhibited an unprecedented ultrastability in solution, despite having exposed Ag sites that can be accessed by small molecules, such as O2, water, and solvents.

      <title>Single&#8208;molecule 3D orientation imaging reveals nanoscale compositional heterogeneity in lipid membranes</title>
      <dc:description>In soft matter, thermal energy causes molecules to continuously translate and rotate, even in crowded environments, thereby impacting the spatial organization and function of most molecular assemblies, such as lipid membranes.

      <title>Revealing the A&#8208;site effect of lead&#8208;free A3Sb2Br9 perovskite in photocatalytic C (sp3)&#8208;H bonds activation</title>

A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  nanoparticles (A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs) with different ratios of Cs and MA show different photocatalytic activity for toluene oxidation and the photocatalytic performance  is enhanced when increasing the amount of Cs. We reveal that the octahedron distortion caused by A&#8208;site cations can change the electronic property of X&#8208;site ions and further affect the electron transfer from toluene molecules to Br sites. After the regulation of A&#8208;site cations, the photocatalytic activity is higher with A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs than that with some classic photocatalysts (TiO  2  , WO  3  and CdS). The main active species involved in photocatalytic oxidation of toluene are photogenerated holes (h  +  ) and superoxide anions (  &#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ). The view of octahedron distortion by A&#8208;site cations affecting photocatalytic activity remains unique and is also a step forward for understanding more insights to halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysis.

      <title>Functional genome mining reveals a novel class V lanthipeptide containing a D&#8208;amino acid introduced by an F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase</title>
      <dc:description>Lantibiotics are a type of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (termed lanthipeptides) with often potent antimicrobial activity. Herein, we report the discovery of a new lantibiotic, lexapeptide, using the Library EXpression Analysis System (LEXAS) approach. Lexapeptide has rare structural modifications, including N&#8208;terminal (N,N)&#8208;dimethyl phenylalanine, C&#8208;terminal (2&#8208;aminovinyl)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;cysteine, and D&#8208;Ala. The characteristic lanthionine moiety in lexapeptide is formed by three proteins (LxmK, LxmX, and LxmY), which are distinct from enzymes known to be involved in lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Furthermore, a novel F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase (LxmJ) from the lexapeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is identified to catalyze the reduction of dehydroalanine to install D&#8208;Ala. Our findings suggest that lexapeptide is the founding member of a new class of lanthipeptides that we designate as class V. We also identified further class V lanthipeptide BGCs in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria genomes, implying that other class V lantibiotics await discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Interpenetrated Single&#8208;Crystal Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as single crystals is extremely challenging. Inaccessibility of open&#8208;structured single&#8208;crystal COFs prevents the exploration of structure&#8208;oriented applications.&#160; Herein we report for the first time a non&#8208;interpenetrated single&#8208;crystal COF, LZU&#8208;306, which possesses the open structure constructed exclusively via covalent assembly. With a high void volume of 80%, LZU&#8208;306 was applied to investigate the intrinsic dynamics of reticulated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as the individual aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission moiety. Solid&#8208;state  2  H NMR investigation has determined that the rotation of benzene rings in TPE, being the freest among the reported cases, is as fast as 1.0 &#215; 10  4  Hz at 203 K to 1.5 &#215; 10  7  Hz at 293 K. This research not only explores a new paradigm for single&#8208;crystal growth of open frameworks, but also provides a unique matrix&#8208;isolation platform to reticulate functional moieties into a well&#8208;defined and isolated state.</dc:description>

      <title>A novel separation&#8211;sensing membrane performing precise real&#8208;time serum analysis during blood drawing</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic and on&#8208;site analysis of serum from human blood is crucial particularly for making decisions during clinical surgery and emergency treatments. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blood assay methods can only collect single or discrete data of physiological analytes, remaining great challenge in online report of dynamic fluctuation of key analytes.

Through precisely controlling the pore structure and nanoshape of biosensing crystals, this membrane achieved accurate and online monitor of glucose and lactate in patients from variety of medical scenarios within 1 min which is one order of magnitude faster than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. Moreover, various kinds of bio&#8208;recognizers can be introduced into this membrane, realizing accurate determinations of glutamate, transaminase and cancer biomarker.

      <title>Beyond polysulfides shuttle and Li dendrite formation: addressing the sluggish S redox kinetics for practical high energy Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Electrolyte modulation has been reported to simultaneously suppress polysulfide shuttle effect and lithium dendrite formation of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries.

      <title>Continuous Synthesis of Aryl Amines from Phenols Utilizing Integrated Packed&#8208;Bed Flow Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Flow with it: Dehydrative amination of phenols under continuous&#8208;flow conditions has been developed. In an integrated packed&#8208;bed flow system containing heterogeneous Pd catalysts, phenols reacted with amines to obtain aryl amines and small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. The method has high product selectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, so that variously substituted aryl amines can be selectively prepared in high yields.







Abstract
Aryl amines are important pharmaceutical intermediates among other numerous applications. Herein, an environmentally benign route and novel approach to aryl amine synthesis using dehydrative amination of phenols with amines and styrene under continuous&#8208;flow conditions was developed. Inexpensive and readily available phenols were efficiently converted into the corresponding aryl amines, with small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes), in multistep continuous&#8208;flow reactors in the presence of heterogeneous Pd catalysts. The high product selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method allowed aryl amines with diverse functional groups to be selectively obtained in high yields over a continuous operation time of one week.

Inexpensive and readily available phenols were efficiently converted into the corresponding aryl amines, with small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and alkanes), in multistep continuous&#8208;flow reactors in the presence of heterogeneous Pd catalysts. The high product selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method allowed aryl amines with diverse functional groups to be selectively obtained in high yields over a continuous operation time of one week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degradation of Structurally Defined Graphene Nanoribbons by Myeloperoxidase and Photo&#8208;Fenton Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>As an emerging member of the graphene family, structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have shown promising applications in various fields. The evaluation of the degradability of GNRs is particularly important for assessing the persistence level and risk of these materials in living organisms and the environment. However, there is a void in the study of the degradation of GNRs. Here, we report the degradation behavior of GNRs in the presence of human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) or treated with photo&#8208;Fenton (PF) reaction. With the assistance of potassium hydroxide or imidazole, which facilitates the dispersion of GNRs in the aqueous solution, GNRs underwent only partial degradation after 25&#8208;hour incubation with hMPO, while, the PF reaction degraded GNRs almost completely after 120 hours. These results indicate that structurally precise GNRs can be efficiently degraded under suitable conditions, providing more opportunities for future applications in different fields.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacially Bridging Covalent Network Yields Hyperstable and Ultralong Virus&#8208;based Fibers for Engineering Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Virus and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are very attractive biological subjects for self&#8208;assembly manipulation and templated synthesis of nanomaterials. However, the fundamental studies and applications are often constrained by problems associated with their structural weakness. Here we present a strategy of interfacially bridging covalent network within tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) VLPs to bring outstanding structural properties and functionalities. We arranged T103C cysteine to laterally conjugate adjacent subunits. In the axis direction, we set A74C mutation and systematically investigated candidate from E50C to P54C as the other thiol function site, for forming longitudinal disulfide bond chains. Significantly, the T103C&#8208;TMV&#8208;E50C&#8208;A74C shows the highest robustness in assembly capability and structural stability with the largest length, for TMV VLP to date. The fibers with lengths from several to a dozen of micrometers even survive under pH 13. The robust nature of this TMV VLP allows for reducer&#8208;free synthesis of excellent electrocatalysts for application in harshly alkaline hydrogen evolution. This study, therefore, presents significant progress to develop existing VLP with unprecedented structural properties and the applications thereof.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the Enigma of Nonoxidative Conversion of Methane on Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane on silica&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  ) by Bao  et al  . (  Science  , 2014,  344  , 616) is a landmark discovery in catalysis science. However, the initially proposed gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism has been much debated. Here, we report a surface reaction mechanism by comprehensive computational modelling and simulations. It is demonstrated that the activation of methane occurs at the single iron site, whereas the dissociated methyl disfavours desorption into gas phase under the reactive conditions. In contrast, the dissociated methyl prefers transferring to adjacent carbon sites of the active centre (Fe  1  &#169;SiC  2  ), followed by C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogen transfer to produce the main product (ethylene) via a key &#8722;CH&#8722;CH  2  intermediate. We find a quasi&#8208;Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (quasi&#8208;MvK) surface reaction mechanism involving extracting and refilling the surface carbon atoms for the nonoxidative conversion of methane on Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  and this new surface process is identified to be more plausible than the alternative gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploiting Two&#8208;Dimensional Bi2O2Se for Trace Oxygen Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials host great potential for environmental gaseous molecules detection in the age of emerging Internet of things owing to their fascinating electronic properties, large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and feasibility to high integration. However, it remains a challenge to develop trace oxygen sensing 2D materials and devices with low detection limit at sub&#8208;ppm range. Here, we exploit a high&#8208;preforming resistive&#8208;type trace oxygen sensor based on 2D high&#8208;mobility semiconducting Bi  2  O  2  Se nanoplates. Scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first&#8208;principle calculations proves an amorphous Se atomic layer formed on the surface of 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se exposed to oxygen, which contributes to larger specific surface area and abundant active adsorption sites. Such 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se oxygen sensors have remarkable oxygen&#8208;adsorption induced variations of carrier density/mobility, and exhibit an ultrahigh sensitivity featuring minimum detection limit of 0.25 ppm, long&#8208;term stability, high durativity, and wide&#8208;range response to concentration up to 400 ppm at room temperature. Moreover, 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se arrayed sensors integrated in parallel form are found to possess an oxygen detection minimum of sub&#8208;0.25 ppm ascribed to an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These advanced sensor characteristics involving ease integration reveal 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se is an ideal candidate for trace oxygen detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Air Stable Lanthanide Eu(II) Complex: New Emitter in Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>Luminescent Eu(II) complexes with characteristic 5d&#8208;4f transition have potential applications in many fields. However, their instability in ambient conditions impedes further exploration and application. Herein, we report two new Eu(II) complexes, bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) (  Eu&#8208;1  ) and bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;methylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) (  Eu&#8208;2  ). Intriguingly, the blue emissive  Eu&#8208;1  showed high air stability arising from fluorine protection and close molecular packing, as maintaining a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 91% (initial 96%) upon exposure to air over 2200 hours. While the orange emissive  Eu&#8208;2  showed a maximum luminance of 30620 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  , and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.5%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency around 100% in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). These results could inspire further research on stable and efficient Eu(II) complexes and their application in OLEDs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyrroline and 2&#8208;azetine are useful synthons for the synthesis of pyrrolidines and azetidines that widely exist in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. But efficient methods for dicarbofuntionalization of these cyclic alkenes are limited.

Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;selective dicarbofunctionalization of  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;pyrroline and  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;azetine, a class of endocyclic enecarbamates previously unexplored by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization. The reaction can also extend to six and seven membered endocyclic enamides. A variety of arylzinc reagents and bromodifluoroacetate and its derivatives are applicable to the reaction, providing a straightforward and efficient access to an array of pyrrolidine&#8208; and azetidine&#8208;containing fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides, which may have applications in life science. Specifically, this protocol paves a new way to the efficient synthesis of functionalized azetidines that are of great interest in pharmacological studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting Quantum Efficiency of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence up to 52% via Intramolecular Halogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications in optoelectronics, bioelectronics, and security protection. However, achieving UOP with high quantum efficiency (QE) over 20% is still full of challenges due to the forbidden intersystem crossing (ISC) and fast non&#8208;radiative transitions in organic molecules. Here, we present a novel strategy to enhance the QE of UOP materials by modulating intramolecular halogen bonding via structural isomerism. The QE of CzS2Br reaches up to 52.10%, which is the highest afterglow efficiency reported so far. The crucial reason for the extraordinary QE is intramolecular halogen bonding, which can not only effectively enhance ISC by promoting spin&#8208;orbit coupling, but also greatly confine excited&#8208;molecular motions to restrict non&#8208;radiative pathways. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient UOP materials for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvation Rule for Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Enabler in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the exceptionally high energy density of lithium metal anodes, the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is still impeded by the instability of the interphase between the lithium metal and the electrolyte. To formulate a functional electrolyte system that can stabilize the lithium metal anode, one must understand the solvation behavior of the solvent molecules since the electrochemical properties of a solvent can be heavily influenced by its solvation status. We unambiguously demonstrated the solvation rule for the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) enabler in an electrolyte system. In this study, fluoroethylene carbonate was used as the SEI enabler due to its ability to form a robust SEI on the lithium metal surface, allowing relatively stable LMB cycling. The results revealed that the solvation number of fluoroethylene carbonate must be &#8805; 1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI in which the sacrificial reduction of the SEI enabler subsequently leads to the stable cycling of LMBs.</dc:description>

Here, we separate aqueous electrolyte from Zn anode by coating a thin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer on anode and filling the pores of MOF with hydrophobic Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP) organic electrolyte that is immiscible with aqueous Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;H2O bulk electrolyte.

The Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;TFEP@MOF electrolyte protected Zn anode enables a Zn||Ti cell to achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.1% for 350 cycles. The highly reversible Zn anode brings a high energy density of 210 Wh kg&#8211;1 (of cathode and anode mass) and a low capacity decay rate of 0.0047% per cycle over 600 cycles in a Zn||MnO2 full cell with a low capacity ratio of Zn:MnO2 at 2:1.</dc:description>

In this work, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted rhenium(I) complex (  DFX&#8208;Re3  ) integrating the clinical iron chelating agent deferasirox (  DFX  ) has been designed.

Finally, we demonstrate that  DFX&#8208;Re3  induces immunogenic apoptotic cell death and exhibits potent antitumor activity  in vivo  .

      <title>Multiexcitonic Triplet Pair Generation in Oligoacene Dendrimers as Amorphous Solid&#8208;state Miniatures</title>
      <dc:description>Singlet fission in organic semiconducting materials has attracted great attention for the potential application in photovoltaic devices as the exciton multiplication process effectively compensates for thermal energy losses. Research interests have been concentrated on identifying working mechanisms of coherent SF processes in crystalline solids as ultrafast SF is hailed for efficient multiexciton generation. However, as long lifetime of the intermediate state, multiexcitonic triplet pair, in amorphous solids facilitates the decorrelation process for triplet exciton extractions, a precise examination of incoherent SF processes is demanded in delicate model systems to represent heterogeneous structures. By introducing dendritic structures, heterogeneous coupling and energetics for SF were developed in our oligoacene oligomers, which mimic complicated SF dynamics in amorphous solids. SF dynamics in dendritic structures was thoroughly investigated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques and quantum chemical calculations in respect of the relative orientation/distance between chromophores and though&#8208;bond/&#8208;space interactions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Singlet fission in organic semiconducting materials has attracted great attention for the potential application in photovoltaic devices as the exciton multiplication process effectively compensates for thermal energy losses. Research interests have been concentrated on identifying working mechanisms of coherent SF processes in crystalline solids as ultrafast SF is hailed for efficient multiexciton generation. However, as long lifetime of the intermediate state, multiexcitonic triplet pair, in amorphous solids facilitates the decorrelation process for triplet exciton extractions, a precise examination of incoherent SF processes is demanded in delicate model systems to represent heterogeneous structures. By introducing dendritic structures, heterogeneous coupling and energetics for SF were developed in our oligoacene oligomers, which mimic complicated SF dynamics in amorphous solids. SF dynamics in dendritic structures was thoroughly investigated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques and quantum chemical calculations in respect of the relative orientation/distance between chromophores and though&#8208;bond/&#8208;space interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stereoselective Oxidative Bioconjugation of Amino Acids and Oligopeptides to Aldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>The first stereoselective, near&#8208;equimolar, and metal&#8208;free oxidative bioconjugation of amino acids and oligopeptides to aldehydes is presented. Based on a newly developed organocatalytic oxidative concept, the C&#8208;terminal and side chain carboxylic acid functionalities of amino acids and oligopeptides are shown to couple in a stereoselective manner to &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral primary amine and a quinone as oxidizing agent. The oxidative coupling generally proceeds in high yield. For aspartic acid, selective coupling of the side&#8208;chain, or the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid, is demonstrated depending on the protection strategy. The stereoselective, oxidative bioconjugation concept is extended to a series of oligopeptides where coupling to carboxylic acid functionalities are presented. Bioorthogonal linker&#8208;molecules for further functionalization are obtained by merging the oxidative coupling strategy with the click concept. It is demonstrated that the configuration of the new stereocenter is determined exclusively by the organocatalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Correlating Glycoforms of DC&#8208;SIGN with Stability Using a Combination of Enzymatic Digestion and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry
</title>
      <dc:description>
Uncovering stability of DC&#8208;SIGN glycoforms with native mass spectrometry: A combined strategy of exoglycosidase sequencing, native mass spectrometry, ion mobility, and gas&#8208;phase unfolding uncovered the occupancy and structural detail of O&#8208;glycans present on the carbohydrate binding domain of DC&#8208;SIGN. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding by ion mobility revealed differences in stability among glycoforms, independent of glycoprotein mass.







Abstract
The immune scavenger protein DC&#8208;SIGN interacts with glycosylated proteins and has a putative role in facilitating viral infection. How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC&#8208;SIGN have not been reported. Herein, we report the development and application of a mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O&#8208;glycans on the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN. We first quantify the Core&#8197;1 and 2 O&#8208;glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein using sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry, we show how specific O&#8208;glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas&#8208;phase stability of the DC&#8208;SIGN isoforms. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites.

      <title>Direct Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol to C5+ Ketones: Role of Pd&#8208;Zn Alloy on Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
Alloy formation between Pd and Zn&#160;enables a new catalytic pathway to generate high&#8208;value compounds selectively from renewable ethanol, as reported by K.&#8197;K. Ramasamy et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202005256).&#160;The key reaction steps for the&#160;direct catalytic conversion of ethanol to C5+&#160;ketones are the in&#8208;situ generation of the acetone intermediate and the cross&#8208;aldol condensation between the reaction intermediates acetaldehyde and acetone.

      <title>Preparation of Functionalized Aryl, Heteroaryl, and Benzylic Potassium Organometallics Using Potassium Diisopropylamide in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
Metalation of functionalized (hetero)arenes with KDA (potassium diisopropylamide)/TMEDA was performed using a commercial continuous flow set&#8208;up leading to the corresponding potassium organometallics. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003392), P. Knochel et&#8197;al. show that trapping with various electrophiles gives polyfunctionalized (hetero)aromatics in good yields. The flow procedure was extended to the lateral metalation of methyl&#8208;substituted (hetero)arenes resulting in benzylic potassium organometallics, which were trapped with various electrophiles.
