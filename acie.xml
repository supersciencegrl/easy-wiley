         <title>Alternating Terpolymers through Cyclopolymerization and Subsequent Orthogonal Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of functionalized alternating copolymers by reversible deactivation radical polymerization was developed. Copolymerization by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer of hexenyl vinyl ether with a novel fluorinated divinyl monomer yields alternating cyclopolymers that can be chemoselectively modified by three distinct orthogonal functionalization reactions. Along the thiol&#8208;ene click reaction and amidation, a third functionalization was achieved via NHC&#8208;catalyzed transesterification or acylation resulting in a small library of ABC&#8208;type alternating terpolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Activation as an Easy Toolbox to Synthesize Pyridine&#8208;Fused Bipolar Hosts for Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenging task. While exploiting new blue emitters has attracted great interest, developing host materials that considerably determine device performance obviously lags behind. Herein, we present an ease of access to the structurally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons by the iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reaction, which unlocks an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of pyridine&#8208;fused bipolar host materials. As an illustrated example, the benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine skeleton (  BTP  ) has been made to a pseudo&#8208;symmetric host (  DCz&#8208;BTP  ). The merging of a pyridine fragment enables strong intermolecular interactions, leading to satisfactory bipolar transporting properties. Utilizing  DCz&#8208;BTP  as the host, blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs (TADF&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 29.0% and blue TADF sensitized florescent OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) give EQEmax as high as 20.5%, revealing the potential of the  BTP  skeleton for the construction of high&#8208;performance host materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein demonstrated an efficient method for the atroposelective construction of nine&#8208;membered carbonate bridged biaryls through vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediates. Diverse products with desirable pharmacological features were synthesized in satisfying yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities. In subsequent bioassays, several agents showed considerable antiproliferative activity via the mitochondrial&#8208;related apoptosis mechanism. Further transformations produced more structural diversity and may inspire new ideas for developing functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging the Non&#8208;Natural Catalytic Activity of Lipase and Electrosynthesis: Asymmetric Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Amines with Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of secondary amines with ketones by combining the non&#8208;natural catalytic activity of lipase with electrosynthesis. Various 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;carbonyl indoles with a stereogenic quaternary carbon center were synthesized from 2&#8208;substituted indoles   in yields up to 78% with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96:4 e.r. and  &gt;  20:  1 d.r.). This  unprecedented  protocol demonstrated that hydrolase catalysis is compatible with electrosynthesis, and the reaction can be carried out in organic solvents with a broad substrate scope and good stereoselectivity.  This work provides insights into enzymatic electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of an N&#8208;Heterocylic Boryl&#8208;Stabilized Disilyne and its Application to the Activation of Dihydrogen and C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon compounds that enable the activation of small molecules has been of great current interest. Reduction of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryltribromosilane (NHB)SiBr  3  (  2  , NHB = [ArN(CMe)  2  NAr]B, Ar = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) with three equiv. of lithium in diethyl ether yielded the NHB&#8208;stabilized disilyne (NHB)Si&#8801;Si(NHB) (  3  ). Disilyne  3  slowly reacted with toluene, leading to the activation of one benzylic C&#8722;H bond and one C=C double bond with the formation of  4  . Treatment of  3  with dihydrogen under 1 atm at room temperature led to the exclusive formation of the first boryl&#8208;stabilized 1,2&#8208;dihydrodisilene. Compounds  3  &#8208;  5  have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction&#160;analysis, which indicated the co&#8208;planarity of the B&#8722;Si&#8722;Si&#8722;B plane with the NHB rings in compounds  3  and  5  . DFT calculations indicated the significant &#960; electron delocalization of the Si&#8722;Si multiple bonds to the B&#8722;N bonds in NHB rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Antigenic Evaluation of Inner Core Oligosaccharides from Acinetobacter baumannii Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four inner core oligosaccharides from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of A.&#8197;baumannii strain ATCC 17904 were chemically synthesized (see structures). Antigenic investigation indicated that the 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide, a common inner core structure of A.&#8197;baumannii LPS, is a potential antigenic epitope that could be used for further immunological research to develop diagnostic tools or vaccines against A.&#8197;baumannii.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is currently posing a serious threat to global health. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent virulence factor of pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. To explore the antigenic properties of A.&#8197;baumannii LPS, four Kdo&#8208;containing inner core glycans from A.&#8197;baumannii strain ATCC 17904 were synthesized. A flexible and divergent method based on the use of the orthogonally substituted &#945;&#8208;Kdo&#8208;(2&#8594;5)&#8208;Kdo disaccharides was developed. Selective removal of different protecting groups in these key precursors and elongation of sugar chain via &#945;&#8208;stereocontrolled coupling with 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene or 5&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl protected Kdo thioglycosides and 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglucosyl thioglycoside allowed efficient assembly of the target molecules. Glycan microarray analysis of sera from infected patients revealed that the 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trimer was a potential antigenic epitope, which is attractive for further immunological research to develop carbohydrate vaccines against A.&#8197;baumannii.

Selective removal of different protecting groups in these key precursors and elongation of sugar chain via &#945;-stereocontrolled coupling with 5,7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylsilylene or 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl protected Kdo thioglycosides and 2-azido-2-deoxyglucosyl thioglycoside allowed efficient assembly of the target molecules. Glycan microarray analysis of sera from infected patients revealed that the 4,5-branched Kdo trimer was a potential antigenic epitope, which is attractive for further immunological research to develop carbohydrate vaccines against &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds: The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanoborylplumbate anions have been obtained and isolated as thermally robust salts. The tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722; was obtained from [EtPbB(CN)3]&#8722; by stepwise dismutation in water or hydrochloric acid via [Et2Pb{B(CN)3}2]2&#8722; and [EtPb{B(CN)3}3]3&#8722;.







Abstract
A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)plumbate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#8722; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; (R=Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal=Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plumbate anions [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1&#8211;4) and PbEt4 as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2 through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=2&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722;.

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type&#8197;II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The global distribution and structural diversity of bacterial aromatic polyketides were assessed by pan&#8208;genomic analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. Such a global atlas will guide genome mining efforts to fully exploit natural products, as exemplified by the discovery of the unusual angular naphthopyrans from a rare actinobacterium.







Abstract
Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type&#8197;II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing a Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Grubbs&#8208;type complexe containing macrocyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with two small aryl arms tied together was obtained and characterised. Interestingly, it can exist in two forms, cis and trans. Both of them exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis, however both can be used in difficult metathesis reactions, also leading to the formation of tetrasubstituted double bonds.







Abstract
Formation of sterically hindered C&#8722;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkyl chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis&#8208;arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;Type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, anionic cyanines are designed as the phototherapy agents by controlling their aggregates through counterion engineering. The resulting J&#8208;type aggregate nanoparticles show NIR emission, high photostability, negatively charge surface, mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, and significantly enhanced singlet oxygen generation efficiency, leading to efficient antitumor phototherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in the biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on a tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant 5&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable in vivo antitumor phototheranostic efficacy, making them have a potential for clinical use.

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong&#8208;binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.

         <title>Inorganic Chiral Hybrid Nanostructures for Tailored Chiroptics and Chirality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of chiral hybrid nanostructures comprising chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and functional semiconductors are constructed via a general synthesis. The obtained hybrids show new and tunable chiroptical activity, and exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance of water splitting under circularly polarized light, paving the way for complex chiral nanostructures and new chiral light&#8211;matter interactions.







Abstract
Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures that embed chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral nanostructures; however, they remain largely unexplored. We report, for the first time, a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures that employ structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allowed us to independently control material parameters such as core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieved enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the heterostructures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we demonstrate that the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8211;matter interactions and chiral device applications.

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic peptide was found to block cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signalling, or quorum sensing, in bacteria and be highly bioavailable in mouse tissue. The controlled release of this agent from degradable polymeric microparticles strongly inhibited skin infection in a wound model at levels that far surpassed the potency of the peptide when delivered conventionally.







Abstract
There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8220;anti&#8208;virulence&#8221; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in Staphylococcus aureus. We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS in vitro. Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) skin infections in vivo, and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus. Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence in vivo and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Expeditious Synthesis of Diblock Copolymers with Different Morphologies by Lewis Pair Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful application of Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly enabled the expeditious, single&#8208;step synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymeric nano&#8208;assemblies with different morphologies from acrylate and methacrylate mixture in minutes.







Abstract
Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its unique advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct a frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control (CSC) copolymerization and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.

         <dc:description>
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides using equivalent amounts of amines has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. The method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated and unreactive N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, representing a powerful new activation mode of unactivated amide bonds.







Abstract
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. Most crucially, the method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, thus reverting the classical order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives. This method provides a direct route to amide&#8208;to&#8208;amide bond interconversion with excellent chemoselectivity using equivalent amounts of amines. The combination of acid and iodide has been identified as the essential factor to activate the amide C&#8722;N bond through electrophilic catalytic activation, enabling the production of new desired transamidated products with wide substrate scope of both unactivated amides and amines, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs (&gt;80&#8197;examples). We anticipate that this powerful activation mode of unactivated amide bonds will find broad&#8208;ranging applications in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective desymmetrization route to [3]&#8208;ladderanol has been devised that is centered around an organocatalytic enantioselective formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of tetracyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenedione. This strategy involving the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality offers flexibility and enabled the facile synthesis of both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue.







Abstract
Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of natural ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.

The use of strained bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) for the synthesis of a library of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone scaffolds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective C&#8722;C activation is described. Both experimental and DFT studies provided insights into the crucial stabilizing effect of base additives on the palladium&#8208;carbon intermediates.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective coupling of readily available bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) with various halides is reported, which offers expedient approaches to a wide range of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone skeletons via single or double C&#8722;C activation. The chemistry shows a broad substrate scope in terms of both the range of BCP&#8722;OH and halides including a series of natural product derivatives. Moreover, dependency of reaction chemodivergence on base additive has been investigated through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, which is expected to significantly enrich the reaction modes and increase the synthetic potential of BCP&#8722;OH in preparing more complex molecules.

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as hydrogen donor is very challenging for hydrogen atom transfer reaction. Compared with gCN, the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) shows the activation of H&#8722;O bonds in water under visible light irradiation, thus rendering water as hydrogen donor for multiple reductions involving a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step and the oxidation of water to H2O2.







Abstract
Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy (BDEH&#8208;O=5.1&#8197;eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate H&#8722;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms via dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8722;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Hydrophobization Engineering of the Air&#8211;Cathode Catalyst for Improved Oxygen Diffusion towards Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic&#8208;inspired hydrophobization engineering of electrocatalysts is developed to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion on an air cathode, achieving enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency toward zinc&#8211;air battery with higher energy density in comparison with that employing the air cathode without hydrophobic surface design.







Abstract
Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in an air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V) than that (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) than that (102&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions to shorten and lengthen the conjugation between oligoaryl alkene units of aggregation&#8208;induced emitters toggle between rapid photocyclization and efficient photoluminescence properties. Trienes are resistant to photocyclization, giving them higher photoluminescence quantum yields, whereas nonconjugated aryl alkene units cyclize readily to form extended polycyclic frameworks.







Abstract
Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkene chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

     alt="Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation-Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions to shorten and lengthen the conjugation between oligoaryl alkene units of aggregation-induced emitters toggle between rapid photocyclization and efficient photoluminescence properties. Trienes are resistant to photocyclization, giving them higher photoluminescence quantum yields, whereas nonconjugated aryl alkene units cyclize readily to form extended polycyclic frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid-state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkene chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation-induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid-state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular N2 was directly fixed into arylamines in a plasma&#8211;liquid system at ambient temperature and pressure without transition metal mediation, which provides a green alternative to the hazardous multistep processes as practiced in the traditional method for large&#8208;scale arylamine production.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8722;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N2) is of great interest but remains a challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8211;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly couple benzene and N2, two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45&#8201;% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N2 (A3
) and N2+ species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing the plasma reactor, the realization of cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N2 could become reality.

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications**
</title>

Porphyrin derivatives that can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence (PL) over 60&#8197;min are reported and a mechanism for the phenomenon is proposed. The derivatives are used to synthesize supramolecular probes with peroxynitrite&#8208;activated PL and light&#8208;triggered imaging&#8208;modality transformation characteristics that permit improved biological uses.







Abstract
Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60&#8197;min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided engineering of an imine reductase IR&#8208;G36 gave a final variant M5 for reductive amination, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of a series of azacycloalkylamines with up to 47&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate loadings and up to 99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Crystal structures of IR&#8208;G36 and computational studies shed light on the structural basis for the performance improvement.







Abstract
Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (R) to &gt;99&#8201;% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The viability of biohybrid technologies is primarily limited by the inherent fragility of the biological component. The operational stability of photoproteins adsorbed to mesoporous ITO electrodes is prolonged to 33&#8197;days under intense illumination, and 28&#8197;months in storage, demonstrating the feasibility of protein&#8208;based devices that last years.







Abstract
The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33&#8197;days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.

The deep eutectic solvent composed of choline chloride and oxalic acid was prepared. After leaching at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 10&#8197;hours, the nickel oxalate dihydrate and the filtrate containing other metal elements are separated. Then the filtrate is diluted with water to precipitate the cobalt oxalate dihydrate. Finally, manganese compounds were separated by adjusting pH.







Abstract
The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1&#8201;%, 95.1&#8201;%, and 95.3&#8201;%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the battery recycling industry.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for fabrication of highly loaded supercapacitors. Coupling with controllable capillary densification, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.







Abstract
Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging. In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time. The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity. Furthermore, simultaneous in situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8211;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics. As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles enhances transmetalation and phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu surface to the Pd surface by low&#8208;flux visible light. This feature enables a choice between the cross&#8208;coupling product and homo&#8208;coupling product dependent on wavelength.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8722;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940&#8197;nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.

         <title>Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic and Acyclic gem&#8208;Difluoromethylenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and cyclic or acyclic gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones enabled the synthesis of chiral gem&#8208;difluoromethylene compounds. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was the key to providing high yield products with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the gem&#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketoester, and a &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.

         <title>Fusion of Multi&#8208;Resonance Fragment with Conventional Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon for Nearly BT.2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise synthetic fusion of a multi&#8208;resonance fragment with a conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), ultrapure green BN&#8208;ICz emitters were successfully constructed. The optimal bottom&#8208;emitting OLED exhibits a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 with a high EQE of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieves the BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78), but also shows a leading performance with current efficiency up to 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99&#8201;%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;.

Through precise synthetic fusion of multi-resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;-conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof-of-concept emitters exhibited ultra-pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99&#8201;%, a small full-width-at-half-maximum of 23&#8197;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom-emitting organic light-emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record-high CIEy value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5&#8201;%. The top-emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Mushroom Polyketide Synthases Produce the Universal Anthraquinone Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Pre&#8208;)Anthraquinones are a diverse class of bioactive natural products. Dissimilar to plants, molds, and bacteria, the webcaps, one of the most species&#8208;rich genera of mushrooms, use an evolutionarily distinct class of remarkably small polyketide synthases to produce atrochyrsone carboxylic acid, the universal precursor of (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones. These enzymes represent an outstanding example of convergent evolution of biosynthetic capacities.







Abstract
(Pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are widely distributed natural compounds and occur in plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, with atrochrysone (1) as the key biosynthetic precursor. Chemical analyses established mushrooms of the genus Cortinarius&#8212;the webcaps&#8212;as producers of atrochrysone&#8208;derived octaketide pigments. However, more recent genomic data did not provide any evidence for known atrochrysone carboxylic acid (4) synthases nor any other polyketide synthase (PKS) producing oligocyclic metabolites. Here, we describe an unprecedented class of non&#8208;reducing (NR&#8208;)PKS. In vitro assays with recombinant enzyme in combination with in vivo product formation in the heterologous host Aspergillus niger established CoPKS1 and CoPKS4 of C.&#160;odorifer as members of a new class of atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthases. CoPKS4 catalyzed both hepta&#8208; and octaketide synthesis and yielded 6&#8208;hydroxymusizin (6), along with 4. These first mushroom PKSs for oligocyclic products illustrate how the biosynthesis of bioactive natural metabolites evolved independently in various groups of life.

         <title>Digitizing Chemical Synthesis in 3D Printed Reactionware</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines reactions as building blocks with 3D printed reactor hardware or reactionware is presented. This practical approach allows the synthetic chemist to encode the unit operations allowing a digital blueprint to be built of the entire process.







Abstract
Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdCu/zeolite exhibited promising catalytic performance for selective oxidation of CH4 to oxygenates with O2 and H2 via tandem catalysis. The PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2, while Cu single atoms activated the H2O2 and facilitated the direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH by a radical&#8208;triggered pathway.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O2 in the presence of H2 at low temperature (120&#8201;&#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited a high oxygenates yield of 1178&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1Pd&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95&#8201;%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2 from O2 and H2, while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H2O2 for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) from H2O2 decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH4 by &#8901;OH to methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3). Subsequently, the &#8901;OH reacted quickly with the &#8901;CH3 to form CH3OH with high selectivity.

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery is constructed with an electrocatalyst&#8208;assisted sulfur positive electrode and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The electrocatalyst accelerates the sulfur conversion and the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfide, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a high energy density and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8211;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries of ultrahigh energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst&#8208;boosting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery, which involves a sulfur&#8208;anchored cobalt/nitrogen co&#8208;doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;impregnated metal&#8211;organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co&#8722;N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al&#8722;Cl and S&#8722;S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43&#8197;V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9&#8197;V. In the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al&#8722;S battery to deliver 820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity and 78&#8201;% capacity retention after 300&#8197;cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al&#8722;S batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.







Abstract
Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This bis&#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the bis&#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross&#8208;Coupling of Carbonyl&#8208; and Imine&#8208;Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalytic system is reported for the divergent tandem cycloisomerization and cross&#8208;coupling of carbonyl&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs). The selection of ancillary ligands is pivotal for the interception of the heteropalladacyclic intermediates with different external nucleophiles.







Abstract
Pd0 catalysts featuring phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization/cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8722;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP's is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.

         <title>Organic Four&#8208;Electron Redox Systems Based on Bipyridine and Phenanthroline Carbene Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel four&#8208;electron redox&#8208;systems featuring up to five isolable oxidation states are presented. The synthesis is modular and based on the combination of diquat or phenanthrolinium salts with stable carbenes. The different oxidation states can be isolated and feature diradical and mixed valence states. Charge/discharge experiments confirm that these redox systems are promising new lead structures for two&#8208;electron anolyte materials.







Abstract
Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV/Vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8211;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.

         <title>Tailored Pyridoxal Probes Unravel Novel Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Targets and Antibiotic Hits in Critical Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented targets are needed to fight the bacterial pandemic. A suite of pyridoxal probes that infiltrate the cellular metabolism of critical pathogens and get incorporated in pyridoxal&#8208;phosphate dependent enzymes is applied. Chemoproteomics facilitated the functional characterization of previously unknown members and the identification of essential targets with antibiotic hit molecules.







Abstract
Unprecedented bacterial targets are urgently needed to overcome the resistance crisis. Herein we systematically mine pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes (PLP&#8208;DEs) in bacteria to focus on a target class which is involved in crucial metabolic processes. For this, we tailored eight pyridoxal (PL) probes bearing modifications at various positions. Overall, the probes exceeded the performance of a previous generation and provided a detailed map of PLP&#8208;DEs in clinically relevant pathogens including challenging Gram&#8208;negative strains. Putative PLP&#8208;DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in&#8208;depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of PLP binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as PLP&#8208;dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel PLP&#8208;DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine&#8208;Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) was explored, featuring fluorine&#8208;substituted pyrene and specific Pb&#8722;Se secondary interactions. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM, afforded an excellent PCE of 22.3&#8201;%, positioning it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with the perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both the HTM layer and the perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3&#8201;% and the dramatically enhanced device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>

Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 catalyzes the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomers. During the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 transforms into another Zr&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;140 which also shows good catalytic reactivity for the degradation of PET.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24&#8197;hours at 260&#8201;&#176;C (total yield of 98&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm H2 and 81&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing fluorophores based on aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission into supramolecular monomers, the molecular weight and fluorescence color of supramolecular polymers can be linked. In this system, with the increasing molecular weight, the fluorescence color changed from dark blue to yellow&#8208;green concurrently, thus enabling the visual differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer M1 with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing M1 concentration (0.100&#8211;100&#8197;mM), the average degree of polymerization (DPDOSY) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DPDOSY and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing a competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Inside Cover: Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 24/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as a hydrogen source to perform chemical reactions is fascinating but challenging because of the high H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy of water (ca. 5&#8197;eV). Tingbin Lim, Ren Su, and co&#8208;workers show in their Research Article (e202204256) that surface&#8208;hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate water for reactions involving a hydrogen atom transfer step, allowing solar&#8208;driven eco&#8208;friendly synthetic chemistry.

Enhancement of the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles by depleting membrane cholesterol is demonstrated by Weiwei&#8197;Gao, Liangfang Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202203115). Increased membrane permeability, caused by the reduction in cholesterol level, is likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. This discovery broadens the use of these biomimetic nanoparticles in drug delivery and biodetoxification.

The global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides is reported by Lihan Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202202286). By pan&#8208;genomic analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases, the global distribution, abundance, and structural diversity of the aromatic polyketides were assessed. The study also provides insight for the molecular evolution of aromatic polyketides and serves as a compass for future discoveries of this class of natural products.

The study also provides insight for the molecular evolution of aromatic polyketides and serves as a compass for future discoveries of this class of natural products.

Are photoproteins stable enough for operation in real world technologies? The Research Article (e202201148) by Vincent&#8197;M. Friebe, Raoul&#8197;N. Frese, and co&#8208;workers pushes the operation of a biohybrid photoelectrode to new lengths. By stabilizing the pathways crucial for electron transfer, it was possible to prolong electrode operation to the equivalent of a full year of solar insolation in the Netherlands, as well as to maintain output after storage for 2.5&#8197;years. These findings will be instrumental for realizing photoprotein&#8208;based technologies such as biosensors or biophotovoltaics.

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection Using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various signal transduction strategies that are employed in chemical and biological sensing with DNA&#8208;based nanostructures are the focus of this Minireview. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methods are also discussed and the considerations that determine the ideal strategy for a given application are delineated.







Abstract
The use of DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes has led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA's inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in constructing photocatalysts based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) heterojunctions, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, which show improved carrier separation and accelerated surface reaction rates for efficient solar energy conversion are discussed systematically in this Review. Techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are also evaluated and challenges and future directions highlighted.







Abstract
With fascinating photophysical properties and a strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.

         <title>Reversing a Platinum Micromotor by Introducing Platinum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced during the sputter&#8208;coating of Pt films by O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the swimming direction of a micromotor by self&#8208;electrophoresis.







Abstract
Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano&#8208; and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum&#8208;containing Janus colloids that catalytically decompose H2O2 into O2, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced on Pt films sputter&#8208;coated in O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self&#8208;electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction were fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro&#8208; and nanomachine.

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano- and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum-containing Janus colloids that catalytically decompose H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced on Pt films sputter-coated in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self-electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction were fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro- and nanomachine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (l)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four&#8208;Way Junction with High Stability In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligonucleotide analogue (l)&#8208;aTNA forms a highly stable four&#8208;way junction, which is used to assemble multiple components conjugated to the short (l)&#8208;aTNA strands. This represents a modular approach to assemble multifunctional drug structures. The cellular targeting of a structure containing a HER2 nanobody is shown in vitro and the circulation of a fatty acid functionalized structure is shown in vivo.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic l&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ) that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum&#8208;stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Generation and Accumulation of Triplet Excitons for Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of generation and accumulation of triplet excitons, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh), which exhibits a fast rate of intersystem crossing and a small energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers.







Abstract
The traditional method to achieve ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is to hybrid n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* configurations in appropriate proportion, which are contradictory to each other for improving efficiency and lifetime of phosphorescence. In this work, through replacing the electron&#8208;donating aromatic group with a methoxy group and combining intramolecular halogen bond to promote intersystem crossing and suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh) has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers. As compared to CzS2Br, which has a similar substituted position of bromine atom and a larger kisc (the rate of intersystem crossing), the smaller &#916;ETT* (the energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence) in 2Br&#8208;OSPh could accelerate the transition from T1 to T1*. This research indicates that both generation and accumulation of triplet excitons play an important role in realizing efficient UOP materials.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Vinylcyclopropanes with Imines for the Synthesis of Chiral Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropanes are important synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. In this study, the first phosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines was achieved, which led to the formation of a range of highly functionalized pyrrolidines in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (up to 98&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines has been developed, which allows facile access to a range of highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines. Notably, this method makes use of vinylcyclopropanes as a synthon for phosphine&#8208;mediated asymmetric annulation reaction, which will offer new opportunities for potential applications of cyclopropanes substrates in phosphine&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations.

         <title>An Anionic Dinuclear Ruthenium Dihydrogen Complex of Relevance for Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic and neutral non&#8208;classical &#963;&#8208;H2 complexes are plentiful, but anionic ones remain exceedingly rare. It was during an investigation into the fate of a Ru&#8208;precatalyst in the light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation that such a species was encountered, which seems to be &#8220;first&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221;: it lacks any substructures that counteract the negative charge and prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H&#8722;H bond from occurring.







Abstract
During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust. Not only are anionic &#963;&#8208;complexes in general exceedingly rare, but the newly formed species seems to be the first example lacking any structural attributes able to counterbalance the negative charge and, in so doing, prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H2 from occurring.

A relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition and enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement is disclosed, affording chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Experimental and DFT calculation results rationalized the Cope rearrangement that allowed for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral endocyclic allenes remains a challenge in allene chemistry owing to unfavored tension and complex chirality. Here, we present a new relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation with enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement, providing a facile route to chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were performed to illustrate the critical, but unusual Cope rearrangement that allows for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral endocyclic allenes remains a challenge in allene chemistry owing to unfavored tension and complex chirality. Here, we present a new relay strategy merging Pd-catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation with enyne-Cope rearrangement, providing a facile route to chiral 9-membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were performed to illustrate the critical, but unusual Cope rearrangement that allows for the complete central-to-axial chirality transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophilic Spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;Biphenylacetylene via Conformational Fixing within a Hollow&#8208;Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;biphenyl acetylene was achieved by virtue of a spatial constraint in a self&#8208;assembled molecular cage. The unusual, folded conformation in the cavity alters the selectivity of the electrophilic cyclization from 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to form a hindered spiro compound. NBS= N&#8208;bromosuccinimide; NIS= N&#8208;iodosuccinimide.







Abstract
A 2&#8208;biphenylacetylene was fixed into a specific conformation within the confined cavity of a hollow cage, where it underwent a regioselective spirocyclization in the presence of an electrophile. A 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization proceeded selectively in the cage, which stands in sharp contrast to the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization that normally occurs in common organic media. The folded conformation adopted by the substrate within the cage was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

         <title>Decarbonylative Transfer Hydrochlorination of Alkenes and Alkynes Based on a B(C6F5)3&#8208;Initiated Grob Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>

B(C6F5)3 initiates the Grob fragmentation of cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted acyl chlorides into a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, carbon monoxide and HCl. In the presence of &#960;&#8208;basic substrates such as alkenes and alkynes, HCl is transferred stepwise to afford the corresponding hydrochlorination products. The overall reaction is a decarbonylative transfer hydrochlorination driven by aromatization and carbon&#8208;monoxide release.







Abstract
Readily available cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;ylcarbonyl chloride derivatives are introduced as bench&#8208;stable HCl surrogates for transfer hydrochlorination of terminal and internal alkenes as well as selected alkynes. The stepwise Grob fragmentation of those acyl chlorides into chloride, carbon monoxide, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, and a proton is promoted by B(C6F5)3. This decarbonylative transfer process enables the addition of HCl across C&#8722;C double and triple bonds with Markovnikov selectivity at room temperature.

         <title>An Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8208;Nickel Photocatalyst for the Amination of Aryl Halides Using Sodium Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous photocatalytic method is reported for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using nickel deposited on a mesoporous carbon nitride material. This procedure removes the need for sophisticated ligands, precious metals, and elevated temperatures/pressures, and it takes place under mild reaction conditions with a recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis. We report a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx). This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.

A catalytic asymmetric P&#8208;arylation of H&#8208;phosphinate was developed via an interesting dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. The copper&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization provides a general method for the highly enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycles. The copper complex was responsible for the racemization of the H&#8208;phosphinates. H&#8208;Phenylphosphinates, H&#8208;alkenylphosphinate and H&#8208;alkylphosphinates were examined and delivered the products in high yields and high ee values.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aryl C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization reaction was successfully developed via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) under mild conditions. This study provides a general and simple method for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of stable six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus heterocycles with excellent enantioselectivities and moderate to high yields. One&#8208;pot gram&#8208;scale asymmetric synthesis of the P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycle from commercially available materials was also successfully accomplished with excellent enantioselectivity and high yield.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;Diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of methylene cyclopropanes allowed the synthesis of a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The structure complexity of 1,4&#8208;diamines was further increased by using two different functionalized amino agents. Mechanistic studies show a potential pathway involving the hydroamination ring&#8208;opening with &#946;&#8208;C elimination followed by a cascade hydroamination sequence.







Abstract
Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH2&#8208;Terfenadine.

     alt="Enantio- and Regioselective Construction of 1,4-Diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of methylene cyclopropanes allowed the synthesis of a wide range of chiral 1,4-diamine derivatives in high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee). The structure complexity of 1,4-diamines was further increased by using two different functionalized amino agents. Mechanistic studies show a potential pathway involving the hydroamination ring-opening with &#946;-C elimination followed by a cascade hydroamination sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4-diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu-catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4-diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4-diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4-diamines and chiral NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring-opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measurements of quenched hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange by NMR, FTIR, and Congo red binding provide a rare, high&#8208;resolution view of the inclusion body (IB) structure at the atomic level. Diverse mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) adopt remarkably similar IB structures comprising an ensemble with some amyloid&#8208;like structure together with extensive native&#8208;like conformations.







Abstract
Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for the Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycoamino Acids and C&#8208;Glycopeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation reaction was developed for the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide.







Abstract
The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with O&#8208;/N&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on classical BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have been achieved through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Remarkably, diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracene (DPBNA), with a highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and excellent performance in phototransistors, is the first BN&#8208;PAH that outperforms amorphous silicon.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8722;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.

Template&#8208;induced complexity: LiBF4 induces the rearrangement of a homoleptic Pd2L4 complex into a Pd4L8 assembly. The complex shows a folded, highly compact structure, with a low apparent symmetry and two highly specific binding pockets.







Abstract
Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]4+ complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8211;guest interactions. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.

         <title>Identifying Crystallographically Different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in LTA Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of crystallographically different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted acid sites in LTA zeolites has been identified using IR and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This has been successfully rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.







Abstract
A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges. Here, we report the direct observation of yet unrecognized bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups in the LTA zeolite whose oxygen atoms are crystallographically different from those of already known Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We also report that the creation of a crystallographically particular type of bridging OH groups in zeolites and its concentration and acid strength can vary strongly with the content and spatial distribution of framework Al atoms, thus being synthetic in nature, which has been rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Corrole&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers are synthesized and are more active and durable than metal corrole monomers for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. By tuning the metal active site, the Co&#8208;based framework showed the highest activity among examined catalysts. With the benefits of using highly active metal corrole cores, this work presents unparalleled examples of metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin&#8208;based frameworks, metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M&#8208;POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M&#8208;POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co&#8208;POP outperformed other M&#8208;POPs by achieving four&#8208;electron ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 340&#8197;mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based POPs as electrocatalysts.

         <title>Membrane Cholesterol Depletion Enhances Enzymatic Activity of Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (NPs) are used for enzyme delivery because of their unique biointerface and loading capabilities. It is demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the NPs is negatively correlated to the level of cholesterol within the cell membranes, providing a facile and practical approach for the design of enzyme&#8208;loaded nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) have been increasingly used to encapsulate therapeutic enzymes for delivery. To better interface these MOF NPs with biological systems, researchers have coated them with natural cell membranes, enabling biomimicking properties suitable for innovative biomedical applications. Herein, we report that the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs can be significantly enhanced by reducing membrane cholesterol content. We demonstrate such cholesterol&#8208;enzymatic activity correlation using zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 MOF NPs to encapsulate catalase, horseradish peroxidase, and organophosphate hydrolase, respectively. MOF NPs coated with membranes of human red blood cells or macrophages show similar outcomes, illustrating the broad applicability of this finding. The mechanistic investigation further reveals that reducing cholesterol levels effectively enhances membrane permeability likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. These results also imply a facile approach to tailoring the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs by simply tuning the membrane cholesterol level.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) has absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm. A counterion&#8208;paired strategy was explored to improve the brightness of HCs in aqueous solution by reducing aggregation and polarization. Profiting from enhanced brightness and well&#8208;shaped absorption spectra, dual&#8208;color imaging based on NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission was performed in living mice for the first time.







Abstract
Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategies to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime. Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120&#8197;nm and 1319&#8197;nm excitation, showing HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclic Allylborates from 1,3&#8208;Dienes and a Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. The cyclic allylborate could be used in several organic transformations such as regioselective protonation, the allylation of electrophiles, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.







Abstract
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Dual In Situ Laser Techniques Underpin the Role of Cations in Impacting Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Raman spectroscopy and the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique elucidated the fact that the nature of alkali metal cations can significantly influence the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework derived NiFe(OOH) electrocatalyst, following the order of Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+.







Abstract
Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8722;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete stereochemical addressability for all atropisomeric enantio&#8208; and diastereomers is viable by converting diketo substrates with simultaneous control over two configurationally stable stereogenic axes. The atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems were prepared by the direct catalyst&#8208;controlled arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalyst with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.







Abstract
Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Starfish Cyclic Steroid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, the use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing glycosylation, the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicoside&#8197;A and D and sepositoside&#8197;A, have been synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Starfishes have evolved with a special type of secondary metabolites, namely starfish saponins, to ward off various predators and parasites; among them, the starfish cyclic steroid glycosides stand out structurally, featuring a unique 16&#8208;membered ring formed by bridging the steroidal C3 and C6 with a trisaccharide. The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid&#8208;sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides&#8197;A (1) and D (2) and sepositoside&#8197;A (3), with an innovative approach, which entails a de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring&#8208;closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>

         <dc:description>
Sterically unhindered silylium ions can initiate the silylalkynylation of terminal alkenes with silylated phenylacetylene derivatives in a two&#8208;component reaction. These alkynylsilanes and the silylium&#8208;ion initiator form bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocations as the actual catalysts (gray box). This new carbosilylation enables the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond (see scheme).







Abstract
A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated, terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by the capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocathode prepared by attaching a molecular cobalt catalyst on a n+&#8208;p Si film coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits 100&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in aqueous media under simulated sunlight irradiation. The high performance benefits from CNTs as both a support platform for highly dispersed molecular active sites and an efficient mediator for charge transfer.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.

We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-protected n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-p Si electrodes (Si&lt;b&gt;|&lt;/b&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of &lt;b&gt;Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(BrqPy)&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;BrqPy&lt;/b&gt;=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si&lt;b&gt;|&lt;/b&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a stable 1-Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOF&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.7&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TON&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of zeolite&#8208;like crystalline porous organic materials, ZOF&#8208;1 with high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) is reported. It is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks.







Abstract
The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic crb net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the determination of the monomer order of sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules by making use of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS is described. This approach, which relies on the introduction of random chain cleavages within the macromolecular backbone, enabled the rapid chemical sequencing of abiotic macromolecules.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone via a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Benzo[c]cinnoline&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Transporting Materials with 3D Molecular Interaction Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design high&#8208;performance electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton exhibit an exceedingly high glass transition temperature, a fast electron mobility and outstanding electroluminescent performances in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
The academically widely used electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs) typically suffer from low glass transition temperatures (Tg) that could lead to poor device stability. Considering practical applications, we herein put forward a &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy to design high&#8208;performance ETMs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton have been proposed and synthesized by the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;acylaniline as the key step. 2,9&#8208;diphenylbenzo[c]cinnoline (DPBZC) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions that feature a 3D architecture, which boosts Tg to exceedingly high 218&#8201;&#176;C with a fast electron mobility (&#956;e) of 6.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. DPBZC&#8208;based fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show outstanding electroluminescent performances with an external quantum efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% and a power efficiency as high as 70.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, which are superior to those of the devices with the commonly used ETMs.

         <title>Metal&#8594;Carbon Dative Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic system containing a phosphine and a carbenium ion as an L&#8208;type and Z&#8208;type ligand, respectively, readily complexes zero&#8208;valent Group 10 metals to form complexes featuring M&#8594;Ccarbenium dative bonds. The formation of these dative bonds is supported by structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies which show that, out of three metals, palladium is the least metallobasic.







Abstract
As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds. Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of Group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the &#947; position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;Ccarbenium interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.

A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked porous organic molecular framework selectively separates aromatics over cyclic aliphatics.







Abstract
Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMFs) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. Here we report a robust porous molecular crystal (TAPM&#8208;1), which is stabilized by multiple intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With its long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking, TAPM&#8208;1 has excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability, recyclability, and high selectivity for aromatics over the corresponding cyclic aliphatics. This enables TAPM&#8208;1 to serve as the stationary phase in the high&#8208;resolution gas chromatographic separation of benzene and cyclohexane or toluene and methylcyclohexane.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators**

The metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with hydrazonium initiators ultilizing the principle of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis is demonstrated.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn&#8804;9.4&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) with relatively low dispersities (&#272;&#8804;1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Bipolar Magnetic Molecules for Spin&#8208;Polarized Electric Current in Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrical control of spin transport at single molecule level is highly desired for molecular nanospintronics. By exploiting magnetic bistability of spin crossover complexes, the magnitude of spin polarization can be modulated. However, efficiently controlling the direction of spin polarization at single molecule level is still challenging. Here, we propose a general method to flip the transport electron spin simply by electrical gating in single molecule devices based on bipolar magnetic molecules (BMMs), of which highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) come from different spin channels. Thus, when device's Fermi level is reversibly adjusted approaching either HOMO or LUMO by changing the polarity of applied voltage gate, a 100% spin polarized current with switchable spin direction is achievable. The proposed method is verified by the calculated electronic and transport properties of 9 potential transition metal coordination BMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Triplet&#8211;Singlet Exciton Interconversion in Narrowband Blue Organoboron Emitters Doped with Heavy Chalcogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emissive organoboron emitters featuring the multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effect have now become a critical material component for constructing high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with pure emission colors. These MR organoboron emitters are capable of exhibiting high&#8208;efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by allowing triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). However, RISC involving spin&#8208;flip exciton upconversion is generally the rate&#8208;limiting step in the overall TADF; hence, a deeper understanding and precise control of the RISC dynamics are ongoing crucial challenges. Here, we introduce the first MR organoboron emitter (  CzBSe  ) doped with a selenium atom, demonstrating a record&#8208;high RISC rate exceeding 10  8  s  &#8722;1  , which is even higher than its fluorescence radiation rate. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;flip upconversion process in  CzBSe  can be accelerated by factors of ~20000 and ~800, compared to those of its oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;doped homologs (  CzBO  and  CzBS  ), respectively. Unlike  CzBO  and  CzBS  , the photophysical rate&#8208;limiting step in  CzBSe  is no longer RISC, but the fluorescence radiation process; this behavior is completely different from the conventional time&#8208;delaying TADF limited by the slow RISC. Benefitting from its ultrafast exciton spin conversion ability, OLEDs incorporating  CzBSe  achieved a maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency as high as 23.9%, accompanied by MR&#8208;induced blue narrowband emission and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off features.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([  7  ]  +  ) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10%. A neutral analog of [  7  ]  +  featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [  7  ]  +  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydroisoquinolines: Seven&#8208;Step Asymmetric Synthesis of Michellamines B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;  trans  &#8208;Disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) is a common heterocyclic structural unit of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. The assembly of this structural unit is not trivial, which constitutes a substantial challenge in the total synthesis of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids and related pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report a modular and convergent method for the rapid assembly of 1,3&#8208;  trans  &#8208;disubstituted THIQ frameworks through a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade. With widely available simple aryl iodides, aziridines and (triisopropyl)acetylene as the building blocks, this method paves a practical way for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;  trans  &#8208;disubstituted THIQs. Based on this new method, concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen and four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been accomplished, demonstrating the broad synthetic utility of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Impacts of Dissolved Ni2+ on the Solid Electrolyte Interphase on a Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy coupled with multivariate curve resolution analysis is used to investigate the impact and distribution of Ni species on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During accelerated aging of the LiNi0.88Co0.08Mn0.04O2/graphite full cell, the dissolution of Ni aggravates significantly upon cycling and a strong correlation between the dissolved&#8208;Ni and organic species in the SEI on graphite is found.







Abstract
Transition metal (e.g. Ni) ions dissolved from layered&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;rich cathodes can migrate to the anode side and accelerate the failure of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The investigations of the impact and distribution of Ni species on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode are crucial to understand the failure mechanism. Herein, we used time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF&#8208;SIMS) coupled with multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis to intuitively characterize the distribution of Ni species in the SEI. We find that the SEI on the graphite electrode using an EC&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits a multi&#8208;stratum structure. During accelerated aging of the LiNi0.88Co0.08Mn0.04O2/graphite full cell, the dissolution of Ni aggravates significantly upon cycling. A strong correlation between the dissolved&#8208;Ni and organic species in the SEI on graphite is illustrated. The ion&#8208;exchange reaction between Ni2+ and Li+ ions in the SEI is demonstrated to be the main reason for the increase of SEI resistivity.

         <title>Binding and Assembly of a Benzotriazole Cavitand in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotriazole&#8208;rimmed cavitand is found to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cavitand complex, stabilized by a cyclic array of hydrogen bonds mediated by water, with various smaller or amphiphilic and ditopic guests. But with longer chains, 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest capsule complexes are formed. Computations support that capsule formation involves additional water molecules on the upper rim that create a self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern for dimerization.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble cavitand bearing a benzotriazole upper rim was prepared and characterized. It exists as a dimeric velcraplex in D2O, but forms host&#8211;guest complexes with hydrophobic and amphiphilic guests. Alkanes (C5 to C10), cyclic ketones (C6&#8211;C10), cyclic alcohols (C6&#8211;C8) and various amphiphilic guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cavitand complexes. A cyclic array of hydrogen bonds, bridged by solvent/water (D2O) molecules, stabilizes the vase conformation of the complexes. With longer alkanes (C12&#8211;C15), symmetrical dialkyl amine, urea and phosphate, 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest capsules are formed. Computations indicate that additional waters on the upper rim create a self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern for capsule formation.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: Hydrogen Bonding to Indolylphosphine Ligands to Provide Fluoride Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable platinum (poly)fluorido complexes activate alkynes. The released fluoride is stabilised in the outer coordination sphere by cooperating indolylphosphine ligands. The complexes were applied for the selective catalytic hydrofluorination of internal alkynes to provide (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes.







Abstract
The reaction of the Pt complexes cis&#8208;[Pt(CH3)2{R2P(Ind)}2] (Ind=2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolyl, R=Ph (1&#8201;a), 4&#8208;FC6H4 (1&#8201;b), 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (1&#8201;c)) with HF afforded the fluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F(HF)2)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2] 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, which can be converted into trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2] (3&#8201;a&#8211;c) by treatment with CsF. Addition of 3&#8208;hexyne to 2&#8201;a&#8211;c gave alkyne complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(C,C&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2H5C&#8801;CC2H5)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2{F(HF)2}] (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) at which a fluoride is stabilised as polyfluoride in the coordination sphere by hydrogen bonding to the indolyl&#8208;substituted phosphine ligands. Subsequent heating of a solution of 4&#8201;a in the presence of PVPHF led to fluoroalkene formation. Selective catalytic hydrofluorination of alkynes to yield (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes were developed. The ability of hydrogen bonding to polyfluoride favours the fluorination step as demonstrated by studies with complexes bearing no indolyl groups at the phosphine ligands.

Subsequent heating of a solution of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of PVPHF led to fluoroalkene formation. Selective catalytic hydrofluorination of alkynes to yield (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-fluoroalkenes were developed. The ability of hydrogen bonding to polyfluoride favours the fluorination step as demonstrated by studies with complexes bearing no indolyl groups at the phosphine ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PdII&#8208;Catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8722;H Activation Facilitated by a Transient Directing Group**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative cross&#8208;coupling between two alkenes under the dual action of a PdII catalyst and a transient directing group (TDG) is demonstrated. The reaction involves TDG&#8208;mediated C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation to generate an endo&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, whose formation is promoted by a tailored carboxylic acid additive.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8722;H alkenylation enabled by a transient directing group (TDG) strategy is described. The dual catalytic process takes advantage of reversible condensation between an alkenyl aldehyde substrate and an amino acid TDG to facilitate coordination of the metal catalyst and subsequent C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation by a tailored carboxylate base. The resulting palladacycle then engages an acceptor alkene, furnishing a 1,3&#8208;diene with high regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity. The reaction enables the synthesis of enantioenriched atropoisomeric 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes, which have seldom been examined in previous literature. Catalytically relevant alkenyl palladacycles were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the energy profiles of the C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation step and the stereoinduction model were elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Ketone&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is rarely explored and remains unprecedented, especially the earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyzed ones. Herein, the first cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of ketone&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers is reported, providing a convenient approach to access valuable enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxy boronic esters, which features broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is a powerful tool for the synthesis of natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals via the versatile transformations of chiral alkyl boronic esters. However, the scope of available alkenes is limited to styrenes, activated alkenes, and compounds with directing groups. The catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is rarely explored and those catalyzed by earth&#8208;abundant metals are yet to be reported. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of ketone&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers and provide a convenient approach to access valuable enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxy boronic esters. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This approach was applied in the successful synthesis of salmeterol and albuterol, demonstrating its potential to streamline complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Guest&#8208;modulated Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Chirality Transfer in Heteroleptic Pd(II) Coordination Cages</title>

         <dc:description>Multicomponent metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly allows to rationally combine different building blocks. Discrete multifunctional hosts with an accessible cavity can be prepared in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. We employ our shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) method to achieve for the first time integrative self&#8208;sorting of heteroleptic PdII&#160;cages showing guest&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). An enantiopure helicene&#8208;based ligand (M&#160;or&#160;P&#160;configuration) is coupled with a non&#8208;chiral emissive fluorenone&#8208;based ligand (A&#160;or&#160;B) to form a series of Pd2L2L&#8217;2&#160;assemblies. The modular strategy allows to impart the chiral information of the helicenes to the overall supramolecular system, resulting in CPL from the non&#8208;chiral component. Guest binding results in a 4&#8208;fold increase of CPL intensity. The principle offers potential to generate libraries of multifunctional materials with applications in molecular recognition, enantioselective photo&#8208;redox catalysis and information processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Single Atoms Anchored on Oxygen&#8208;Doped Tubular Carbon Nitride for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Simultaneous Coordination Structure and Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method was developed to modulate the coordination environment and regulate support architecture, thus incorporating oxygen atoms into the first shell of Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The high activity and 1O2 selectivity of Co&#8722;N3O1 correlated with an enhanced adsorption energy of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and reduced activation barriers. As a result, the catalysts were attached to a membrane to deliver a catalytic filter with 97.5&#8201;% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Simultaneous regulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and engineering architectures with efficient exposed active sites are efficient strategies for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. We isolated cobalt atoms with dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination (Co&#8722;N3O1) on oxygen&#8208;doped tubular carbon nitride (TCN) by pyrolyzing a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyanuric acid melamine&#8211;cobalt acetate precursor. The theoretically constructed Co&#8722;N3O1 moiety on TCN exhibited an impressive mass activity of 7.61&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1 with high 1O2 selectivity. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cobalt single atoms occupied a dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination environment, and that PMS adsorption was promoted and energy barriers reduced for the key *O intermediate that produced 1O2. The catalysts were attached to a widely used poly(vinylidene fluoride) microfiltration membrane to deliver an antibiotic wastewater treatment system with 97.5&#8201;% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10&#8197;hours, thereby revealing the suitability of the membrane for industrial applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conducting electrochemistry in an applied magnetic field generates forces that affect the electrochemical system due to a change in fundamental electrochemical principles. The fundamental mechanisms behind the observed changes in different applications are discussed in this Review. Suggestions on interference exclusion and possible future perspectives of magnetoelectrochemistry are also proposed.







Abstract
Developing new strategies to advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemistry is crucial to mitigating multiple contemporary technological challenges. In this regard, magnetoelectrochemistry offers many strategic advantages in controlling and understanding electrochemical reactions that might be tricky to regulate in conventional electrochemical fields. However, the topic is highly interdisciplinary, combining concepts from electrochemistry, hydrodynamics, and magnetism with experimental outcomes that are sometimes unexpected. In this Review, we survey recent advances in using a magnetic field in different electrochemical applications organized by the effect of the generated forces on fundamental electrochemical principles and focus on how the magnetic field leads to the observed results. Finally, we discuss the challenges that remain to be addressed to establish robust applications capable of meeting present needs.

         <title>Cobalt Silylenes as Platforms for Catalytic Nitrene&#8208;Group Transfer by Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful approach to cooperative group&#8208;transfer catalysis is demonstrated using the Co=Si bond of a cobalt silylene to provide two distinct sites for substrate activation. The orthogonal selectivity of the Co and Si centers enables efficient nitrene&#8208;group transfer to carbon monoxide by avoiding poisoning that would result from substrates competing for a single reactive site.







Abstract
A cobalt silylene (Co=Si) linkage enables a distinct metal/ligand cooperative activation of an organic azide, where nitrene transfer occurs to and from the Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si linkage without ligand dissociation from the 18&#8208;electron cobalt center. This process utilizes the orthogonal binding affinities of the silicon and cobalt sites to avoid CO poisoning that would otherwise inhibit reactivity, leading to significantly improved catalytic isocyanate generation compared with related systems. The dual&#8208;site approach demonstrates the potential of metal/main&#8208;group bonds to access new and efficient catalytic pathways.

         <title>Electron Diffraction Enables the Mapping of Coke in ZSM&#8208;5 Micropores Formed during Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron diffraction was demonstrated here as a powerful tool to localize coke in the micropore domain of the ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst that is deactivated in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon conversion. The results show that the formation of coke is initiated in the channel intersections, while its deposition in the straight pores occurs in the late deactivation stages.







Abstract
Unveiling the coke formation in zeolites is an essential prerequisite for tackling the deactivation of these catalysts in the transformations of hydrocarbons. Herein, we present the direct mapping of coke in the micropores of ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts used in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons conversion by single&#8208;crystal electron diffraction analysis. The latter technique revealed a polycyclic aromatic structure along the straight channel, wherein the high&#8208;quality data permit refinement of its occupancy to about 40&#8201;%. These findings were exploited to analyze the evolution of micropore coke during the reaction. Herein, coke&#8208;associated signals, which correlate with the activity loss, indicate that the nucleation of coke commences in the intersections of sinusoidal and straight channels, while the formation of coke in the straight pores occurs in the late stages of deactivation. The findings uncover an attractive method for analyzing coke deposition in the micropore domain.

         <title>A Silylene Stabilized by a &#963;&#8208;Donating Nickel(0) Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylene complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand was successfully synthesized. This complex exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic SiII atom and shows a peculiar chemical behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of the Si and Ni centers. DFT calculations demonstrated that a simple rotation of 90&#176; on the Si&#8722;Ni bond reverses the role of Ni, transforming a classical silylene&#8594;Ni0 complex into the corresponding Ni0&#8594;silylene complex.







Abstract
A donor&#8208;stabilized silylene 4 featuring a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand was synthesized. Complex 4 exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic SiII center and shows a peculiar behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of Si and Ni centers. Calculations indicate that the orientation of Ni&#8208;ligands with respect to the silylene moiety is crucial in determining the role of the Ni&#8208;fragment (Lewis acid or Lewis base) towards silylene. Indeed, a simple 90&#176; rotation of the Si&#8722;Ni bond, reverses the role of Ni, and transforms a classical silylene&#8594;Ni0 complex into an unprecedented Ni0&#8594;silylene complex.

         <title>Induction of Diverse Cryptic Fungal Metabolites by Steroids and Channel Blockers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungi encode a diverse array of secondary metabolites that remain to be mined. The first agar&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput elicitor screen with two fungal strains was conducted and led to the identification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs as strong enhancers of secondary metabolism. The elicitors enabled the discovery of 13 novel cryptic metabolites, notably sclerocyclane with an unprecedented azatropane scaffold and antimicrobial activity against an ecological competitor of fungi.







Abstract
Fungi offer a deep source of natural products but remain underutilized. Most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that can be detected are silent or &#8220;cryptic&#8221; in standard lab cultures and their products are thus not interrogated in routine screens. As genetic alterations are difficult and some strains can only be grown on agar, we have herein applied an agar&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput chemical genetic screen to identify inducers of fungal BGCs. Using R.&#8197;solani and S.&#8197;sclerotiorum as test cases, we report 13 cryptic metabolites in four compound groups, including sclerocyclane, a natural product with a novel scaffold. Steroids were the best elicitors and follow&#8208;up studies showed that plant&#8208;steroids trigger sclerocyclane synthesis, which shows antibiotic activity against B.&#8197;plantarii, an ecological competitor of S.&#8197;sclerotiorum. Our results open new paths to exploring the chemical ecology of fungal&#8208;plant interactions and provide a genetics&#8208;free approach for uncovering cryptic fungal metabolites.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Mechanism of O.&#8722;/Ni2+&#8208;Mediated Methane Conversion to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiAl2O4+&#8208;mediated methane conversion to formaldehyde: The mechanism of methane activation by NiAl2O4+ has been explored by a combination of mass spectrometry, infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The oxygen radical anion O.&#8722; in NiAl2O4+ initiates hydrogen atom abstraction from methane, while the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+ is crucial for the subsequent formation of formaldehyde.







Abstract
The gas&#8208;phase reaction of NiAl2O4+ with CH4 is studied by mass spectrometry in combination with vibrational action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Two product ions, NiAl2O4H+ and NiAl2O3H2+, are identified in the mass spectra. The DFT calculations predict that the global minimum&#8208;energy isomer of NiAl2O4+ contains Ni in the +II oxidation state and features a terminal Al&#8722;O.&#8722; oxygen radical site. They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH3&#8901;) or formaldehyde (CH2O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O.&#8722; site, followed by either CH3&#8901; loss or CH3&#8901; migration to an O2&#8722; site next to the Ni2+ center. The CH3&#8901; attaches as CH3+ to O2&#8722; and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni&#8208;center reducing it to Ni+. The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.

ESA's comet rendezvous mission Rosetta investigated the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8211;Gerasimenko to reveal information about the most pristine material preserved in the Solar System. The analysis of the mass spectrum recorded twenty&#8208;five minutes after touchdown by non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations shows the presence of twelve organic molecules that represent the inventory of cometary nuclei and the early Solar System.

Abstract
The most pristine material of the Solar System is assumed to be preserved in comets in the form of dust and ice as refractory matter. ESA's mission Rosetta and its lander Philae had been developed to investigate the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8211;Gerasimenko in situ. Twenty&#8208;five minutes after the initial touchdown of Philae on the surface of comet 67P in November 2014, a mass spectrum was recorded by the time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer COSAC onboard Philae. The new characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations reveals the chemical composition of comet 67P. A suite of 12 organic molecules, 9 of which also found in the original analysis of this data, exhibit high statistical probability to be present in the grains sampled from the cometary nucleus. These volatile molecules are among the most abundant in the comet's chemical composition and represent an inventory of the first raw materials present in the early Solar System.

         <title>Recent Breakthroughs in P4 Chemistry: Towards Practical, Direct Transformations into P1 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of white phosphorus directly into useful P1 products has long been an extremely challenging synthetic goal. However, in the past few years, several independent breakthroughs have shown that such reactions are achievable using a variety of different mechanistic strategies. This Minireview highlights these recent innovations, discusses their key features, and analyses their implications for the future development of this field.







Abstract
For several decades, academic researchers have been intensively studying the chemistry of white phosphorus (P4) in the hope of developing direct methods for its transformation into useful P&#8208;containing products. This would bypass the hazardous, multistep procedures currently relied on by industry. However, while academically interesting P4 activation reactions have become well established, their elaboration into useful, general synthetic procedures has remained out of reach. Very recently, however, a series of independent reports has begun to change this state of affairs. Each shows how relatively simple and practical synthetic methods can be used to access academically or industrially relevant P1 compounds from P4 directly, in &#8220;one pot&#8221; or even in a catalytic fashion. These reports mark a step change in the field of P4 chemistry, and suggest its possible transition from an area of largely academic interest to one with the promise of true synthetic relevance.

         <title>Accelerated Post&#8208;Polymerization Amidation of Polymers with Side&#8208;Chain Ester Groups by Intramolecular Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;polymerization amidation of non&#8208;activated esters is an interesting opportunity in the structural diversification and synthetic upcycling of various polymers. While amidation typically proceeds slowly, polymers with ester side&#8208;chains benefit from intramolecular activation when reacted with amines featuring a second hydrogen&#8208;bonding functional group. The observed acceleration is dependent on the macromolecular structure.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of esters to amides represents new opportunities in the synthetic diversification and upcycling of polymers, as esters are commonly featured in various polymer structures. Yet, direct amidation is typically hampered by poor reaction kinetics and the effects of polymer structure on the reactivity remain poorly understood. We report the accelerated amidation for amines with additional hydrogen bond donating or accepting groups. These amines facilitate the expeditious (co)amidation of polymers with pendant ester groups, displaying at least a 400&#8208;fold higher reactivity relative to polyesters with esters in the main chain. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the reactivity and degree of polymerization for poly(methyl acrylate) suggests a hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated intramolecular activation of the esters, which was confirmed by FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and basic molecular mechanics modeling. The reported method paves the way to synthesize diverse (co)polymers with amide side chains from readily available polymeric precursors.

         <title>Structural Origin of Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Hybrid Manganese Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structural types of chiral hybrid manganese bromides both exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions. The coordinated type results in much higher dissymmetry factor (glum) due to the chirality of the inorganic framework induced by the distortion from coordination.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) and a superior photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light sources. Here, we report eight new chiral hybrid manganese halides, crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121 and showing intense CPL emissions. Oppositely&#8208;signed circular dichroism (CD) and CPL signals are detected according to the R&#8208; and S&#8208;configurations of the chiral alkanolammonium cations. Time&#8208;resolved PL spectra show long averaged decay lifetimes up to 1&#8197;ms for (R&#8208;3&#8208;quinuclidinol)MnBr3 (R&#8208;1). The glum of polycrystalline samples for coordinated structures (23&#215;10&#8722;3) is more than doubled compared with the non&#8208;coordinated ones (8.5&#215;10&#8722;3), due to the structural variations. R&#8208;1 exhibit both a high glum and a high PLQY (50.2&#8201;%). The effective chirality transfer mechanism through coordination bonds, with strongly emissive MnII centers, enables a new class of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>The Raw Mixed Conducting Interphase Affords Effective Prelithiation in Working Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A raw mixed ion/electron conductor interphase is established on the Li source and anode by using a dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, enabling an unimpeded electron channel structure for elevating the Li source utilization and reducing the formation of dead Li.







Abstract
Contact prelithiation is an important strategy to compensate the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the dead Li generated from inadequate Li conversion reduces the cycling stability of rechargeable batteries. Herein a mono&#8208;solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte was employed in contact prelithiation for the first time. We discover that the low&#8208;organic&#8208;content raw electrolyte interphase (REI) induced by this electrolyte on Li source and anode is a mixed ion/electron conductor. Therefore, electron channels can be maintained even when the Li source has been completely wrapped by the DMC&#8208;derived REI. As a result, an outstanding Li source utilization of 92.8&#8201;% and a negligible dead Li yield can be realized. This strategy renders batteries with a very high initial Coulombic efficiency (90.0&#8201;%) and an excellent capacity retention (94.9&#8201;%) over 210&#8197;cycles, highlighting the significance of REI for effective contact prelithiation.

&lt;p&gt;Contact prelithiation is an important strategy to compensate the initial capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. However, the dead Li generated from inadequate Li conversion reduces the cycling stability of rechargeable batteries. Herein a mono-solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte was employed in contact prelithiation for the first time. We discover that the low-organic-content raw electrolyte interphase (REI) induced by this electrolyte on Li source and anode is a mixed ion/electron conductor. Therefore, electron channels can be maintained even when the Li source has been completely wrapped by the DMC-derived REI. As a result, an outstanding Li source utilization of 92.8&#8201;% and a negligible dead Li yield can be realized.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic and Hydrophobic Surfaces of Aromatic Rings to Enhance Membrane Association and Cell Uptake of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents that increase hydrophobicity, electrostatic surface potential, polarizability and dipole moment of aromatic rings enhance binding to phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes, and increase peptide uptake into cells.







Abstract
Aromatic groups are key mediators of protein&#8211;membrane association at cell surfaces, contributing to hydrophobic effects and &#960;&#8208;membrane interactions. Here we show electrostatic and hydrophobic influences of aromatic ring substituents on membrane affinity and cell uptake of helical, cyclic and cell penetrating peptides. Hydrophobicity is important, but subtle changes in electrostatic surface potential, dipoles and polarizability also enhance association with phospholipid membranes and cell uptake. A combination of fluorine and sulfur substituents on an aromatic ring induces microdipoles that enhance cell uptake of 12&#8208;residue peptide inhibitors of p53&#8208;HDM2 interaction and of cell&#8208;penetrating cyclic peptides. These aromatic motifs can be readily inserted into peptide sidechains to enhance their cell uptake.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Janus Nickel Sites on Red Phosphorus for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive&#8208;group guided approach is taken to synthesize atomically dispersed Ni catalysts on red phosphorus. The advanced system consists of Janus single&#8208;atom Ni sites: P&#8722;Ni for water reduction and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni for water oxidation, leading to the efficient separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and overall improved photocatalytic water splitting activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nickel catalysts hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their plentiful active sites and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we adopt a reactive&#8208;group guided strategy to prepare atomically dispersed nickel catalysts on red phosphorus. The hydrothermal treatment of red phosphorus leads to the formation of P&#8722;H and P&#8722;OH groups, which behave as the reactive functionalities to generate the dual structure of single&#8208;atom P&#8722;Ni and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni catalytic sites. The produced single&#8208;atom sites provide two different functions: P&#8722;Ni for water reduction and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni for water oxidation. Benefitting from this specific Janus structure, Ni&#8208;red phosphorus shows an elevated hydrogen evolution rate compared to Ni nanoparticle&#8208;modified red phosphorus under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate was additionally enhanced with increased reaction temperature, reaching 91.51&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm excitation wavelength.

         <dc:description>Despite a growing progress for the construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols is less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes. This practical protocol features ambient reaction conditions, high atom economy, good functional&#8208;group compatibility, and cleaner manner with H2 as the only by&#8208;product, producing a wide range of valuable chiral silanols and bis&#8208;silanols in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of saturated boron&#8208;incorporated cyclic molecules has been synthesized employing an arene&#8208;hydrogenation methodology.  cis  &#8208;Selective hydrogenation of easily accessible, and biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin&#8208;derivatives is reported. Among the various catalysts tested, rhodium cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8232;[Rh&#8208;CAAC] (  1  ) pre&#8208;catalyst revealed the best hydrogenation activity confirming turnover number up to 1400 with good to high diastereoselectivity. A broad range of functional groups was tolerated including sensitive substituents such as &#8722;F, &#8722;CF  3  , and &#8722;silyl groups. The utility of the synthesized products was demonstrated by the recognition of diols and sugars under physiological conditions. These motifs can have a substantial importance in medicinal chemistry as they possess a three&#8208;dimensional structure, are highly stable, soluble in water, form hydrogen bonds, and interact with diols and sugars.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reported here is the first catalytic atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles, which delivers functionalized atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles with excellent optical purity. This reaction was furnished by 1,6&#8208;nucleophilic addition to  p  &#8208;quinone diimines. Control experiments suggest an ionic mechanism that differs from the radical addition pathway commonly proposed for 1,6&#8208;addition to quinones. The origin of 1,6&#8208;addition selectivity was investigated through computational studies. Preliminary studies show that the obtained 3&#8208;aminoindoles atropisomers exhibit anticancer activities. This method is valuable with respect to enlarging the toolbox for atropochiral amine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction through Hydrophobic Microenvironment and Binuclear Cobalt Synergistic Effect in Metallogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Assemblies that mimic natural lipid bilayers are theoretically efficient for photocatalytic CO2  reduction; however, such an approach has not been yet explored. Herein, metallogels (LG/Nico&#8208;Co) based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipid (LG/Nico) and cobalt (Co) ions exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction, with 208724 &#956;mol g&#8208;1  CO production within 24 h and 90% CO/H2  selectivity, or 166826 &#956;mol g&#8208;1  CO production within 12 h and 46% CO/H2  selectivity, depending on the water content of the solvent. The alkyl chains of LG/Nico provide a hydrophobic microenvironment for efficient gas transfer, and the assembled bilayers induce a synergistic effect between two adjacent Co ions for catalyzing the CO2  reduction reaction. These architectures present new alternatives for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic soft matter based on the assembly of small amphiphilic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Li&#8211;N Interaction Induced Deep Eutectic Gel Polymer Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As emerging eutectic mixtures, deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) show unique properties for Li metal batteries (LMBs).   However, the limited choice and inferior electrode compatibility hinder their further development in LMBs.  Herein, we report a new 1,2&#8208;dimethylimidazole (DMIm)&#8208;based deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte induced by Li&#8211;N interaction  . We demonstrate that  incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer into the DMIm&#8208;based DEE changes the coordination environment of Li  +  ions, leading to a high transference number of Li  +  ions (0.65) and superior interface stability between the electrolyte and Li anode. The deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte exhibits excellent non&#8208;flammability, high ionic conductivity (1.67 mS cm  &#8722;1  at 30 &#176;C), and high oxidation voltage (up to 4.35 V  vs  . Li/Li  +  ). The Li||LFP cell based on the newly developed deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte can achieve superior long&#8208;term cycling stability at a wide range of rate  s.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Ultrasensitive Dynamic Wrinkling on Floating Films Induced by Photo&#8208;Orientation of Azopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ubiquitous surface wrinkling has been well studied theoretically and experimentally. How to modulate the stress state of a liquid&#8208;supported system for the unexploited wrinkling capabilities remains a challenge. Here we report a simple linearly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light illumination to spatiotemporally trigger ultrasensitive in&#8208;situ dynamic wrinkling on a floating azo&#8208;film. The smart combination of the liquid substrate with photoresponsive azo&#8208;moieties leads to the light&#8208;induced ultrafast wrinkling evolution, accompanied by unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The involved different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers is disclosed experimentally for the first time. Meanwhile, programmable dynamic wrinkling with all&#8208;optical switchable surface topographies is available, which has wide application potentials in photoresponsive soft photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>The chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precursor conversion chemistry and surface chemistry of Cu  3  N and Cu  3  PdN nanocrystals are unknown or contested. Here, we first obtain phase pure, colloidally stable nanocubes. Second, we elucidate the pathway by which copper(II) nitrate and oleylamine form Cu  3  N. We find that oleylamine is both a reductant and a nitrogen source. Oleylamine is oxidized by nitrate to a primary aldimine, which reacts further with excess oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with Cu(I) to form Cu  3  N. Third, we investigated the surface chemistry and find a mixed ligand shell of aliphatic amines and carboxylates (formed in&#8208;situ). While the carboxylates appear tightly bound, the amines are easily desorbed from the surface. Finally, we show that doping with palladium decreases the bandgap and the material becomes semi&#8208;metallic. These results bring insight into the chemistry of metal nitrides and will help the development of other metal nitride nanocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Inhibitors of Interferon&#8208;Induced JAK&#8208;STAT Signalling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interferons (IFN) are cytokines which, upon binding to cell surface receptors, trigger a series of downstream biochemical events including Janus Kinase (JAK) activation, phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription protein (STAT), translocation of pSTAT to the nucleus and transcriptional activation. Dysregulated IFN signalling has been linked to cancer progression and auto&#8208;immune diseases. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a small molecule that blocks IFN&#947; activation of JAK&#8208;STAT signalling. Further lead optimisation gave rise to a potent and more selective analogue that exerts its activity by a mechanism consistent with direct IFN&#947; targeting  in vitro  , which reduces bleeding in model of haemorrhagic colitis  in vivo  . This first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule also inhibits type I and III IFN&#8208;induced STAT phosphorylation  in vitro.  Our work provides the basis for the development of pan&#8208;IFN inhibitory drugs .</dc:description>

         <title>VPO4F Fluorophosphates Polyanion Cathodes for&#160;High&#8208;Voltage Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage for the fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphates polyanion cathodes were proposed as the proton cathode for the first time.  Combining experimental results and theoretical simulation, a universal criterion for proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO  4  F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with a specific  capacity of 116 mAh g  &#8208;1  at a high potential of 1.0 V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO  4  F electrode was also verified through X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO  4  F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of  VPO  4  F  for 300 cycles. This work provides new inspiration in the exploitation of new electrode materials for electrochemical proton storage devices.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage for the fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphates polyanion cathodes were proposed as the proton cathode for the first time.  Combining experimental results and theoretical simulation, a universal criterion for proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO  4  F) was demonstrated as a promising high-voltage proton cathode material with a specific  capacity of 116 mAh g  -1  at a high potential of 1.0 V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO  4  F electrode was also verified through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO  4  F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of  VPO  4  F  for 300 cycles.

         <title>Eutectic Electrolyte with Unique Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) presents great potential in energy storage due to low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability, dendrite growth, and narrow electrochemical window limit its practical application. Herein, we develop a new eutectic electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnCl  2  for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lifespan ZIBs. The EG molecules participate in the Zn  2+  solvation via coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. Optimizing the ZnCl  2  /EG molar ratio (1:4) can strengthen intermolecular interactions to form [ZnCl(EG)]  +  and [ZnCl(EG)  2  ]  +  cations. The dissociation&#8208;reduction of these complex cations enables the formation of Cl&#8208;rich organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase film on Zn anode, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with long&#8208;term stability of ~3200 h. Furthermore, the polyaniline||Zn cell manifests decent cycling performance with ~78% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles, and the assembled pouch cell demonstrates high safety and stable capacity. This work opens an avenue for developing eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;safety and practical ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent alkene functionalization that produces either regioisomer starting from the same raw materials is desirable. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed switchable site&#8208;selective alkene hydroalkylation. The selection of reaction temperatures leads to protocols that provide regiodivergent hydroalkylated products starting from a single alkene substrate. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines, both of which are important to the fields of pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry. In addition, enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;branched alkylamines can be accessed in a catalytic asymmetric variant. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of a more stable nickelacycle provides the driving force of migration. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of different reduction elimination intermediates are responsible for the switchable site&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation Potential Gap (&#916;Eox): The Hidden Parameter in Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative biaryl coupling of aryls with different electronic features generally fails. However, this has not been systematically studied via theoretical analysis, and thus, the crucial factor governing coupling efficiency remains unclear. Herein, we propose that the &#8220;oxidation potential gap (  &#916;  E  ox  )&#8221; is a key parameter in predicting the efficiency of an intramolecular oxidative coupling reaction, with &#916;  E  ox  defined as a difference in the oxidation potentials of the relevant aromatic rings. Our experimental and computational analyses revealed that the efficiency of an aromatic intramolecular coupling reaction correlates with the activation energy (&#916;  E  &#8225;  ) of C&#8211;C bond formation of the radical cation intermediates. Furthermore, &#916;  E  &#8225;  correlates with &#916;  E  ox  . Therefore, we demonstrate the tuning of &#916;  E  ox  by attaching cleavable extra electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing groups, enabling the rational synthesis of a phenanthridone skeleton using aromatic rings with an electronic gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping&#8208;Mediated Energy&#8208;Level Engineering of M@Au12 Superatoms (M = Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) for Efficient Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a series of MAu  12  (dppe)  5  Cl  2  (  MAu  12  ; M = Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir; dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), which have icosahedral M@Au  12  superatomic cores, and systematically investigated their electronic structures, photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was expanded when doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table. The PL quantum yield was enhanced with an increase in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and reached to 0.46&#8211;0.67 for  MAu  12  (  M = Pt, Rh, or Ir  )  under deaerated conditions. The bright PLs from  MAu  12  (  M = Pt, Rh, or Ir  )  were assigned to phosphorescence based on quenching by O  2  .  MAu  12  (  M = Pt, Rh, or Ir  )  acted as a more efficient and stable photocatalyst than  Au  13  for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition via the oxidative quenching cycle. This study provides rational guides for designing photoluminescent and photocatalytic gold superatoms by the doping of heterometal elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Bastimolide&#8197;A: A Showcase for Type I Anion Relay Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of remote stereochemistry via successive Type I Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC) coupling of commercially available enantioenriched epoxides has enabled a 20&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bastimolide&#8197;A. The streamlined assembly and manipulation of ARC products demonstrates a versatile approach that could be leveraged toward other polyhydroxylated macrolides







Abstract
A highly convergent total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bastimolide&#8197;A (1), a polyhydroxy antimalarial macrolide, has been achieved via a longest linear sequence of twenty steps from commercially available glycidyl ethers. Type I Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC) coupling tactics enable rapid construction of the molecule's 1,5&#8208;polylol backbone. A late&#8208;stage B&#8208;alkyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura union and an Evans&#8208;modified Mukaiyama macrolactonization generate the forty&#8208;membered Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated macrocyclic lactone.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;Based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;Hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetra&#8208;BF2 complexes with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole ligands that emit in the visible to red region in solution and in the solid state were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The dyes are rigid but can rotate flexibly around the bipyrrole moiety, resulting in large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Tuning the rotational barrier enables circularly polarized emission based on axial chirality to be achieved.

This study reports the facile syntheses of tetra&#8208;boron difluoride (tetra&#8208;BF2) complexes, flag&#8208;hinge&#8208;like molecules that exhibit intense green&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence in solution and yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emission in the solid states. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations suggested a bent structure of this series of compounds. The complexes also exhibited excellent optical properties, with quantum yields reaching 100&#8201;% and a large Stokes shift. These properties were attributed to the altered bending angle of the molecule in the S1 excited state. As the rotational motion was suppressed around the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole axis, atropisomers with axial chirality were formed, which are optically resolvable into (R) and (S)&#8208;enantiomers through a chiral column. The atropisomers thus function as circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials, in which the color (green, green&#8208;yellow, and yellow) can be varied by controlling the aggregation state. This rational design of multi&#8208;BF2 complexes can potentially realize novel photofunctional materials.

&lt;p&gt;A series of tetra-BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes with 2,2&#8242;-bipyrrole ligands that emit in the visible to red region in solution and in the solid state were synthesized by a one-pot reaction. The dyes are rigid but can rotate flexibly around the bipyrrole moiety, resulting in large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Tuning the rotational barrier enables circularly polarized emission based on axial chirality to be achieved.

         <title>Flexible Cuprous Triazolate Frameworks as Highly Stable and Efficient Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction with Tunable C2H4/CH4 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks functionalized with dinuclear copper sites can serve as highly stable and efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4, and the selectivity is tunable by the size of uncoordinated ligand side groups.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, but they are generally instable and difficult to control the product selectivity. We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4. By changing the size of ligand side groups, the C2H4/CH4 selectivity ratio can be gradually tuned and inversed from 11.8&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 1&#8201;:&#8201;2.6, giving C2H4, CH4, and hydrocarbon selectivities up to 51&#8201;%, 56&#8201;%, and 77&#8201;%, respectively. After long&#8208;term electrocatalysis, they can retain the structures/morphologies without formation of Cu&#8208;based inorganic species. Computational simulations showed that the coordination geometry of Cu(I) changed from triangular to tetrahedral to bind the reaction intermediates, and two adjacent Cu(I) cooperated for C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4. Importantly, the ligand side groups controlled the catalyst flexibility by the steric hindrance mechanism, and the C2H4 pathway is more sensitive than the CH4 one.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Cyclic&#8208;Helical Polymers with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of chirally cyclic PdII catalysts were developed that initiated a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, providing cyclic polymers with precise molecular weight and low dispersity. Owing to the single&#8208;handed helical backbone, these polymers showed interesting circularly polarized luminescence with tuneable handedness and dissymmetric factor.







Abstract
Cyclic polymers attract attention because of their endless structure and unique properties, which differ from the linear analogs. However, the synthesis of cyclic polymers is difficult and prohibits their functions and applications. In this study, we reported chiral cyclic PdII&#8208;catalysts that initiate a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, yielding a single&#8208;handed cyclic&#8208;helical poly(phenyl isocyanide), with predictable molecular weight (Mn) and low dispersity (Mw/Mn), in good yield. Using this method, cyclic bottlebrush polymers were prepared via the grafting&#8208;onto strategy. The cyclic topology was confirmed using various spectroscopic data and atomic force microscope observation. Moreover, the cyclic polymer brushes, comprising of a one&#8208;handed helical backbone, showed interesting photoluminescence and circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence.

         <title>Towards Control and Oversight of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Diagnosis and Monitoring through Multiplexed Quantitative Electroanalytical Immune Response Biosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed amperometric bioplatform can detect and quantify total and isotype N&#8208; and S&#8208;specific anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 serum immunoglobulins within 75&#8197;minutes. The platform was used to analyze the global and isotype&#8208;specific immune response of COVID&#8208;19 convalescent and vaccinated individuals, and to detect variant&#8208;specific S antibodies from variants of concern.







Abstract
The development of versatile and sensitive biotools to quantify specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 immunoglobulins in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected and non&#8208;infected individuals, built on the surface of magnetic microbeads functionalized with nucleocapsid (N) and in&#8208;house expressed recombinant spike (S) proteins is reported. Amperometric interrogation of captured N&#8208; and S&#8208;specific circulating total or individual immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA), subsequently labelled with HRP&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies, was performed at disposable single or multiplexed (8&#215;) screen&#8208;printed electrodes using the HQ/HRP/H2O2 system. The obtained results using N and in&#8208;house expressed S ectodomains of five SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (including the latest Delta and Omicron) allow identification of vulnerable populations from those with natural or acquired immunity, monitoring of infection, evaluation of vaccine efficiency, and even identification of the variant responsible for the infection.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement with an Unusual Regioselective and Stereospecific 1,2&#8208;Methyl Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective and stereospecific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement of internal and cyclic epoxides through a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift gave aldehydes or ketones as the sole product with enantio&#8208;retention. The unique isomerization was incorporated into enantioselective cascades, providing novel access to chiral alcohols, acids and amines from readily available trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrenes.







Abstract
The Meinwald rearrangement is a synthetically useful reaction but often lacks regioselectivity and stereocontrol. A significant challenge in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is the non&#8208;regioselective migration of different substituents to give a mixture of products. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereospecific 1,2&#8208;methyl shift in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is reported. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzed the unique isomerization of internal epoxides through 1,2&#8208;methyl shift without 1,2&#8208;hydride shift to give the corresponding aldehydes and a cyclic ketone as the sole product. SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization showed high stereospecificity, fully retaining the stereoconfiguration. The synthetic utility of this enzymatic Meinwald rearrangement was demonstrated by its incorporation into three new types of enantioselective cascades, to convert trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyl styrenes into the corresponding R&#8208;configured alcohols, acids, or amines in high ee and yield.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Temperature&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Borylative Cyclizations of Enynes: BCl3&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization reactions of 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes provide straightforward access to polycyclic borylated building blocks. Depending on the temperature, either phenanthrenes (at 60&#8201;&#176;C) or phenanthrene&#8208;fused cyclobutanes (at 0&#8201;&#176;C) can be obtained selectively. The reaction at 60&#8201;&#176;C proceeds through an unusual skeletal rearrangement unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclizations.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization of biphenyl&#8208;embedded 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes in the presence of simple and inexpensive BCl3 provided synthetically useful borylated building blocks. The outcome of the process depends on the reaction temperature, with borylated phenanthrenes obtained at 60&#8201;&#176;C and phenanthrene&#8208;fused borylated cyclobutanes formed at 0&#8201;&#176;C. Based on DFT calculations, a mechanism for these novel transformations has been proposed, which involves an uncommon skeletal rearrangement, including migration of a methyl group and alkyne fragmentation, unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclization reactions.

         <title>Modifying the Electrocatalytic Selectivity of Oxidation Reactions with Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electrocatalytic transformations of organic compounds, the selectivity can be controlled by adding an ionic liquid as a catalytic modifier. The concept is demonstrated for the selective oxidation of 2,3&#8208;butanediol&#8212;a reaction which is of practical relevance for energy storage and the production of fine chemicals.







Abstract
The &#8220;solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer&#8221; (SCILL) is an extremely successful new concept in heterogeneous catalysis. The idea is to boost the selectivity of a catalyst by its modification with an ionic liquid (IL). Here, we show that it is possible to use the same concept in electrocatalysis for the selective transformation of organic compounds. We scrutinize the electrooxidation of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, a reaction which yields two products, singly oxidized acetoin and doubly oxidized diacetyl. When adding the IL (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium trifluormethanesulfonate, [C2C1Im][OTf]), the selectivity for acetoin increases drastically. By in situ spectroscopy, we analyze the underlying mechanism: Specific adsorption of the IL anions suppresses the activation of water for the second oxidation step and, thus, enhances the selectivity for acetoin. Our study demonstrates the great potential of this approach for selective transformation of organic compounds.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Ligand Targeting the &#946;1&#8208;Adrenoceptor Enables Light&#8208;Control of the Cardiac Rhythm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Summary

Catecholamine&#8208;triggered &#946;&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;&#8208;AR) signaling is essential for the correct functioning of the heart. Although both &#946;1&#8208; and &#946;2&#8208;AR subtypes are expressed in cardiomyocytes, drugs selectively targeting &#946;1&#8208;AR have proven this receptor as the main target for the therapeutic effects of beta blockers in the heart. Here, we report a new strategy for the light&#8208;control of &#946;1&#8208;AR activation by means of photoswitchable drugs with a high level of &#946;1&#8208;/&#946;2&#8208;AR selectivity. All reported molecules allow for an efficient real&#8208;time optical control of receptor function  in vitro  . Moreover, using confocal microscopy we demonstrate that the binding of our best hit, pAzo&#8208;2, can be reversibly photocontrolled. Strikingly, pAzo&#8208;2 also enables a dynamic cardiac rhythm management on living zebrafish larvae using light, thus highlighting the therapeutic and research potential of the developed photoswitches. Overall, this work provides the first proof of precise control of the therapeutic target &#946;1&#8208;AR in native environments using light.</dc:description>

         <title>Commonly Used Alkylating Agents Limit Persulfide Detection by Converting Protein Persulfides into Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection and quantitation of protein persulfides requires trapping with alkylating agents. Persulfide adducts derived from commonly used alkylating agents are unstable under biologically relevant conditions. The adducts convert to thioethers by losing sulfane sulfur to nucleophilic acceptors. Alkylating agents that form stable persulfide adducts and are suitable for persulfide trapping in biological samples are also reported.







Abstract
Protein persulfides (R&#8208;S&#8208;SH) have emerged as a common post&#8208;translational modification. Detection and quantitation of protein persulfides requires trapping with alkylating agents. Here we show that alkylating agents differ dramatically in their ability to conserve the persulfide's sulfur&#8211;sulfur bond for subsequent detection by mass spectrometry. The two alkylating agents most commonly used in cell biology and biochemistry, N&#8208;ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, are found to be unsuitable for the purpose of conserving persulfides under biologically relevant conditions. The resulting persulfide adducts (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) rapidly convert into the corresponding thioethers (R&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) by donating sulfur to ambient nucleophilic acceptors. In contrast, certain other alkylating agents, in particular monobromobimane and N&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;iodoacetamide, generate stable alkylated persulfides. We propose that the nature of the alkylating agent determines the ability of the disulfide bond (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) to tautomerize into the thiosulfoxide (R&#8208;(S=S)&#8208;Alk), and/or the ability of nucleophiles to remove the sulfane sulfur atom from the thiosulfoxide.

         <title>Electrolyte Sieving Chemistry in Suppressing Gas Evolution of Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sodium (Na) metal batteries hold great promise as a sustainable technology owing to the high element abundance and low cost. However, the generally used carbonate electrolytes remain highly reactive towards Na metal, leaving flammable gas evolution. Here, we propose an electrolyte sieving strategy to separate anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pairs from dilute electrolytes by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pair firstly weakens the electron withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5% and long service life of 800 cycles in full cells. Moreover, the electrode stability is well preserved even under harsh conditions of high temperature and ester&#8208;based electrolytes with higher reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>SrZnGeS4: A Dual&#8208;Waveband Nonlinear Optical Material with a Transparency Spanning UV/Vis and Far&#8208;IR Spectral Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronic structure&#8208;engineering &#8220;bucket effect&#8221; strategy produces a novel non&#8208;linear optical compound SrZnGeS4 with unique dual&#8208;waveband NLO properties, including a second harmonic generation of 0.9&#8211;17.5&#215;AgGaS2 under 850&#8211;2100&#8197;nm incident laser wavelengths and a laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 35&#215;AgGaS2.







Abstract
Non&#8208;linear optical chalcogenides with a wide band gap (Eg) and excellent NLO properties are key materials for highly desirable multiwaveband tunable optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). We exploit the &#8220;electronic structure engineer bucket effect&#8221; to develop a novel dual&#8208;waveband SrZnGeS4 with an ultrawide transparency window. It exhibits an asymmetric Fdd2 structure that consists of layers formed by corner&#8208;sharing [ZnGeS6] dimers. SrZnGeS4 is transparent from 0.30 to 23.6&#8197;&#956;m, spanning the UV&#8208;, vis&#8208;, mid&#8208; and far&#8208;IR spectral regions and has the widest Eg (3.63&#8197;eV) in the AeMIIMIVQ4 family to date. It exhibits phase matching, high SHG intensities (e.g., 11.0&#215;KDP and 17.5&#215;AGS under &#955;inc=1450 and 950&#8197;nm, respectively), and a very high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (35&#215;AGS). These results not only suggest bright prospects for high&#8208;power laser applications but may also enable applications of the multiwaveband OPO system from the UV&#8208;visible to far&#8208;IR regions.

         <title>Enhanced Structural Stability and Pressure&#8208;Induced Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced structural stability and pressure&#8208;induced photoconductivity in two&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8722;Br perovskites by inserting organic C6H5CH2NH3 groups between layers is reported. No obvious volume collapse and amorphization of the perovskite&#8208;like structure is observed under compression up to 30&#8197;GPa. The pressure&#8208;induced photoconductivity behavior ranging from 10 to 40&#8197;GPa enables the further development for photovoltaic devices under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The eco&#8208;friendly properties enable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cu&#8208;based perovskites as ideal candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, but practical application is limited by low photoelectric conversion efficiency because of poor carrier transport abilities. Here, we report enhanced structural stability of 2D CuBr4 perovskites under compression up to 30&#8197;GPa, without obvious volume collapse or structural amorphization, by inserting organic C6H5CH2NH3 (PMA) groups between layers. The band gap value of (PMA)2CuBr4 can be effectively tuned from 1.8 to 1.47&#8197;eV by employing external pressures, leading to a broadened absorption range of 400&#8211;800&#8197;nm. Notably, we successfully detected photoconductivity of the photoresponse at pressures from 10 to 40&#8197;GPa; the maximum value of 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is observed at 28&#8197;GPa, indicating potential applications for high performance photovoltaic candidates under extreme conditions.

         <title>Tetracoordinate Boron&#8208;Based Multifunctional Chiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters simultaneously showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission, circularly polarized luminescence, mechanochromism, and piezochromism behaviors have been developed. Moreover, a highly efficient solution&#8208;processed nondoped near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diode peaking at 716&#8197;nm was demonstrated with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.9&#8201;%, and a record&#8208;high exciton utilization efficiency of 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Purely organic emitters have shown great potential but still suffer from low efficiency in near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative recombination. In this contribution, two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers (R/S&#8208;DOBP and R/S&#8208;HDOBP) with tetracoordinate boron geometries were designed and synthesized. The TADF emitters simultaneously showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission, circularly polarized luminescence, high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism, and piezochromism behaviors. More importantly, R/S&#8208;DOBP and R/S&#8208;HDOBP revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields and efficient reverse intersystem crossing in neat films. The nondoped solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on these unique emitters revealed the NIR emission (peaking at 716&#8197;nm) with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.9&#8201;% and high exciton utilization efficiency of 86&#8201;%, which represent one of the best solution&#8208;processed nondoped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Biodegradable Iridium(III) Coordination Polymer for Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Photodynamic Therapy Using an Apoptosis&#8211;Ferroptosis Hybrid Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable iridium(III) coordination polymer IrS NPs was developed to trigger an apoptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death pathway and achieve tumor suppression in two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy. Additionally, the changes in luminescence lifetime between monomer and polymer allow phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM) imaging for targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). These properties combine to make IrS NPs highly effective anticancer PDT agents.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy is hindered by the high glutathione concentration, poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties, poor drug loading into delivery systems, and an inefficient activation of the cell death machinery in cancer cells. To overcome these limitations, herein, the formulation of a promising IrIII complex into a biodegradable coordination polymer (IrS NPs) is presented. The nanoparticles were found to remain stable under physiological conditions but deplete glutathione and disintegrate into the monomeric metal complexes in the tumor microenvironment, causing an enhanced therapeutic effect. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate in the mitochondria where these trigger cell death by hybrid apoptosis and ferroptosis pathways through the photoinduced production of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion radicals. This study presents the first example of a coordination polymer that can efficiently cause cancer cell death by apoptosis and ferroptosis upon irradiation, providing an innovative approach for cancer therapy.

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform that allows in situ tracking of the spatial and temporal dynamics of enzymes in response to mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy is presented by Lele Li and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203238). Activatable translocation of the specific enzyme to mitochondria is monitored during the NIR light&#8208;triggered, spatially selective generation of reactive oxygen species.

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light of deuterium shines in the darkness of the molecular mechanism of the oxidized phosphatidylcholine synthesis. A concise protocol for the controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids is reported by Kotaro Hama, Ryo Takita, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202202779). The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid.

The cometary Rosetta mission visited the nucleus of Comet 67P/Churyumov&#8208;Gerasimenko by placing the Philae Lander on its surface. Philae was equipped with a time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer that analyzed, for the first time, cometary surface material in situ. Uwe&#8197;J. Meierhenrich and co&#8208;workers describe in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201925) the characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least square fitting and Monte Carlo analysis revealing the chemical composition of cometary ices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched chromanone lactones were prepared by copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester substituted chromones, as reported by Jin Cui, Masakatsu Shibasaki et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203128). The catalytic system features the use of chiral ligands to control the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective addition of copper vinylogous enolates to chromones. The cover illustrates superimposed product structures, dropping a hint about the ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.

         <title>Dissecting Solvent Effects on Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The experimental isolation of H&#8208;bond energetics from the typically dominant influence of the solvent remains challenging. Here we use synthetic molecular balances to quantify amine/amide H&#8208;bonds in competitive solvents. Over 200 conformational free energy differences were determined using 24 H&#8208;bonding balances in 9 solvents spanning a wide polarity range. The correlations between experimental interaction energies and gas&#8208;phase computed energies exhibited wild solvent&#8208;dependent variation. However, excellent correlations were found between the same computed energies and the experimental data following empirical dissection of solvent effects using Hunter&#8217;s &#945;/&#946; solvation model. In addition to facilitating the direct comparison of experimental and computational data, changes in the fitted donor and acceptor constants reveal the energetics of secondary local interactions such as competing H&#8208;bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Catalytic selective hydroxylation of unactivated aliphatic (sp3) C&#8722;H bonds without a directing group represents a formidable task for synthetic chemists. Through directed evolution of P450BS&#946; hydroxylase, we realize oxyfunctionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in a broad spectrum of aliphatic carboxylic acids with varied chain lengths, functional groups and (hetero&#8208;)aromatic moieties in a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective fashion (&gt;30 examples, C&#946;/C&#945;&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The X&#8208;ray structure of the evolved variant, P450BS&#946;&#8208;L78I/Q85H/G290I, in complex with palmitic acid well rationalizes the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and also reveals a reduced catalytic pocket volume that accounts for the increased reactivity with smaller substrates. This work showcases the potential of employing a biocatalyst to enable a chemical transformation that is particularly challenging by chemical methods.

         <title>Ligand Fluorination to Mitigate the Raman Relaxation of DyIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets: A Combined Terahertz, Far&#8208;IR and Vibronic Barrier Model Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination at the axial position of pentagonal&#8208;bipyraimdal dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnets is shown to effectively reduce the anharmonic phonon&#8208;assisted Raman relaxation process, as validated by THz, far&#8208;IR, ab initio, and DFT calculations using a newly established vibronic&#8208;barrier model.







Abstract
The fast Raman relaxation process via a virtual energy level has become a puzzle for how to chemically engineer single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with better performance. Here, we use the trifluoromethyl group to systematically substitute the methyl groups in the axial position of the parent bis&#8208;butoxide pentapyridyl dysprosium(III) SMM. The resulting complexes&#8212;[Dy(OLA)2py5][BPh4] (LA=CH(CF3)2&#8722; 1, CH2CF3&#8722; 2, CMe2CF3&#8722; 3)&#8212;show progressively enhanced TBhys (@100&#8197;Oe&#8201;s&#8722;1) from 17&#8197;K (for 3), 20&#8197;K (for 2) to 23&#8197;K (for 1). By experimentally identifying the varied under barrier relaxation energy in the 5&#8211;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 regime, we are able to identify that the C&#8722;F bond related vibration energy of the axial ligand ranging from 200 to 350&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is the key variant for this improvement. Thus, this finding not only reveals a correlation between the structure and the Raman process but also provides a paradigm for how to apply the vibronic barrier model to analyze multi&#8208;phonon relaxation processes in lanthanide SMMs.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Diamine Cation Anchoring Enables Efficient Charge Transfer and Suppressed Ion Migration in Bi&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#8208;site cation engineering is employed to regulate the dielectric screening effect in Bi&#8208;based perovskite single crystals. The higher polarity of diamine 3&#8208;AMP2+ than monoamine BZA+ produces a more efficient dielectric screening effect, which further reduces exciton binding energy, defect states and ion migration. As a result, the photodetector based on (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 single crystals achieves an excellent detection performance.







Abstract
Due to the large distance or weak electronic conjugation between adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons, the charge transport in the low&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites is impeded and thus hinders their future developments. In this work, A&#8208;site cation engineering by monoamine BZA (benzylamine) and diamine 3&#8208;AMP (3&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine) has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to regulate the corresponding activation energy of ionic migration and carrier transport capacity. Given the higher polarity of 3&#8208;AMP than BZA, producing a more efficient dielectric screening effect, it gives rise to obtaining the small exciton binding energy (50&#8197;meV) and low defect states (3.53&#215;109&#8197;cm&#8722;3). The reduced distance of adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons by the bilateral anchoring of the 3&#8208;AMP2+ diamine cation enhances both electronic conjugation and charge transport performance. Therefore, the photodetector for (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 SC shows a 243&#8208;fold increase in on/off ratio compared with the (BZA)3BiI6 SC.

         <title>Unimolecular Nanoparticles toward More Precise Regulations of Self&#8208;Assembled Superlattices in Soft Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the precisely synthesized giant molecule &#946;CD&#8208;O21 the concept of soft unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs) has been realized. Upon self&#8208;assembly or assembly with other giant molecules, &#946;CD&#8208;O21 directly participates in superlattice formation, giving rise to various complex superlattices with fast dynamics and enhanced ordering.







Abstract
The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process opens up great potential for the construction of nanostructural superlattices. Precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices, however, remains a challenge. Even when the primary molecules are precise, the supramolecular motifs (or secondary building blocks) can vary dramatically. In the present work, we propose the concept of unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs). The UMNPs act as the supramolecular motif and directly pack into the superlattices. A highly branched giant molecule is presented. We systematically explore its conformations and the superlattice of this giant molecule. Moreover, intriguing complex phases are discovered when blending this UMNP with other conventional giant molecules. These binary mixtures provide direct evidence to support our previously proposed self&#8208;sorting process in the self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;. The concept of UMNPs offers a unique approach toward more precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices in soft matter.

         <title>A Fluorescent Cage for Supramolecular Sensing of 3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence by rotational restriction of two tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine, a key biomarker of kidney injury. This cage, with a limit of detection under physiologically relevant concentrations, is the first reported fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound.







Abstract
3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine (NT) is generated by the action of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and as a consequence it is accumulated in inflammation&#8208;associated conditions. This is particularly relevant in kidney disease, where NT concentration in blood is considerably high. Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.

Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinucleotides copy RNA in the absence of enzymes or ribozymes. Genetic copying, producing the complementary strand to a template, drives replication. Self&#8208;replication, based solely on molecular recognition and chemical reactivity, is a mainstay of the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis for the origin of life. Dimers, the very first products of oligomerization, are superior building blocks in dilute aqueous solution, as now shown by Clemens Richert and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203067). (Illustration of RNA duplexes based on PDB entry&#8197;1qc0).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydroboration/isomerization/hydroboration of 2&#8208;aryl vinylcyclopropanes was for the first time reported for the preparation of valuable chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity via asymmetric sequential isomerization/hydroboration of a trisubstituted alkene intermediate. The gram&#8208;scale reaction was carried out smoothly and this protocol was used for asymmetric syntheses of (&#8208;)&#8208;preclamol in gram&#8208;scale. The two primary C  (  sp  3)  &#8208;B bonds in chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) could be distinguished in iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, delivering chiral 1,2,5&#8208;triaryl alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity. Based on experimental and computational studies, a cobalt&#8208;hydride species was proposed as the active intermediate in hydroboration, isomerization, and second hydroboration reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Release of ROS and NO for Overcoming Biofilm Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterogeneity in biofilm is a major challenge in biofilm therapies due to different susceptibility of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to antibacterial agents. Here, we described a therapeutic strategy that overcame biofilm heterogeneity, where antibacterial agent (NO) and EPS dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe  3+  ) were separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8208;shell nanoplatform. Compared with traditional combinational chemotherapies which suffer from inconsistent pharmacokinetics profiles, this strategy drew on the pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO, where ROS with a short diffusion distance and a high redox potential corrupted the EPS, facilitating NO, which has a long diffusion distance and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, to penetrate the biofilm and eliminate the resident bacteria. Additionally, the construction of three&#8208;dimensional spherical biofilm model is novel and clinically relevant.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Complex Peptidyl Nucleoside Antibiotics: Asymmetric De Novo Syntheses of Miharamycin B and Its Biosynthetic Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Miharamycins belong to a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique nine&#8208;carbon pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2&#8208;aminopurine moiety. Herein, we report the de novo total synthesis of miharamycin B and its biosynthetic precursor from 3&#8208;bromofuran and Garner&#8217;s aldehyde through a modified Achmatowicz reaction. Many challenges were resolved toward the de novo synthesis of miharamycin B, including the introduction of a dense array of functional groups, the stereoselective construction of consecutive stereocenters, dealing with the variability of the anomeric positions, and promoting site&#8208;selectivity in the cyclization to form the tetrahydrofuran ring. This de novo synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of 3&#8217;&#8208;substituted saccharides, allowing the study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships and mode of action, and meets the growing demand for the development of novel antibiotics inspired by miharamycin natural products.</dc:description>

One of the most straightforward approaches to access chiral silanes is metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation. Although significant advances have been achieved in enantioselective construction of either a carbon&#8208;stereogenic center or a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center through enantioselective intermolecular hydrosilylation, simultaneous establishment of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in an acyclic molecule through a single intermolecular hydrosilylation remained undeveloped because of the difficulty to effectively control the stereoselectivity for both stereogenic centers. Herein, an unprecedented cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes is presented, enabling construction of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in a single intermolecular transformation.

However, limited success has been achieved in terms of its concise and direct synthesis. We report herein a facile electrochemical migratory cyclization of  N  &#8208;acylsulfonamides to access a diverse array of benzoxathiazine dioxides. The inclusion of electrochemistry is crucial for realizing such a novel transformation, which is substantiated both by the experiments and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Sila&#8208;Adamantane and Its Ensuing Optical Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript describes the first syntheses of functionalized sila&#8208;adamantanes via site&#8208;selective reactions. Mechanistic inquiry into the isomerization of sila&#8208;adamantane revealed new approaches for installing halides at the 2&#8208;position of the cluster. Meanwhile, isomerization via Lewis acid catalysts with non&#8208;nucleophilic counteranions provided access to sila&#8208;adamantane on gram&#8208;scale, enabling us to discover strategies for substituting its 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, &amp; 7&#8208;positions with identical or distinct functional groups. Optical absorbance and density functional theory studies show that &#963;&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the 1&#8208;position strongly perturb optical absorbance in sila&#8208;adamantane, whereas substituents at the exocyclic and 2&#8208;position are optically inert. As silicon diamondoids are atomically precise models for silicon nanocrystals, our findings suggest that passivation at tertiary surface sites carry an outsized impact on the optical properties of surface&#8208;functionalized Si nanocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioinspired Iron&#8208;Molybdenum &#956;&#8208;Nitrido Complex and Its Reactivity toward Ammonia Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimetallic nitride species, especially those containing biologically related iron or molybdenum, are fundamentally important to understand the nitrogen reduction process catalysed by FeMo&#8208;nitrogenase. However, until now, there remains no report about the construction of structurally well&#8208;defined FeMo heteronuclear nitrido complex and its reactivity toward ammonia formation. Herein, a novel thiolate&#8208;bridged Fe  II  Mo  VI  complex featuring a bent Fe&#8722;N&#8801;Mo fragment is synthesized and structurally characterized, which can be easily protonated to form a &#956;&#8208;  imido complex. Subsequently, through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, this imido species can smoothly convert into the &#956;&#8208;  amido complex, which can further undergo reductive protonation to afford the FeMo complex containing an ammine ligand. Overall, we present the first well&#8208;defined {Fe( &#956;  &#8208;S)  2  Mo} platform that can give a panoramic picture for the late stage (N  3&#8722;  &#8594; NH  2&#8722;  &#8594; NH  2  &#8722;  &#8594; NH  3  ) of biological nitrogen reduction by the heterometallic cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective, Anisotropic, or Consistent Polarized&#8208;Photon Out&#8208;Coupling of 2D Organic Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano&#8208; and micromaterials with anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport have widespread application prospects in quantum optics, optoelectronics, and displays. But the nature of the polarization information of the out&#8208;coupled light, with respect to that of the source luminescence, has never been explored in active optical waveguiding organic crystals. Herein, three different modes (selective, anisotropic, and consistent) of polarized&#8208;photon out&#8208;coupling are proposed and successfully implemented in a set of 2D organic microcrystals with highly linearly&#8208;polarized luminescence. It is found that the polarization direction and degree of the luminescence out&#8208;coupled through different waveguiding channels can either be essentially retained or distinctly changed with respect to those of the original luminescence, depending on the molecular arrangement and the orientation of transition dipole moments of the crystal. This work demonstrates the promising potential of 2D emissive microcrystals in multi&#8208;channel polarized photon transport</dc:description>

         <title>The Intrinsic Role of the Fusion Mode and Electron&#8208;Deficient Core in Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors featuring an angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core has significantly boosted the progress of organic solar cells. Herein, to reveal the intrinsic role of the peculiar A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A structure, we have investigated the optoelectronic and excited state dynamics properties of a representative A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A acceptor of Y6 in comparison with its A&#8208;D&#8208;A counterparts having different fusion modes. The results show that the angular fusion mode incorporation of electron&#8208;deficient core results in deeper and delocalized frontier orbitals, endowing Y6 with enhanced and red&#8208;shifted light absorption. Moreover, the angular fusion mode reduces electron&#8208;vibration couplings, accounting for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6. Notably, the exciton dissociation process can be further promoted by introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core, enabling efficient charge generation at low driving forces for the Y6&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have gained tremendous interest for their rich functional properties. However, the coexistence of more than one of the ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity have been rarely found in OIHPs.&#160; Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr  2+  &#8208;based OIHP, [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]  2  CrCl  4  ([DFCBA]  2  CrCl  4  ), which shows both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It undergoes a 4/  mmm  F  m  type ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature as high as 387 K and shows multiaxial ferroelectricity with a saturate polarization of 2.1  &#956;  C/cm  2  . Meanwhile, it exhibits soft ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 32.6 K. This work throws light on the exploration of OIHPs with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for applications in future multifunctional smart devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation is a step&#8208;economical strategy for peptide functionalization. Herein, we report the method of late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of tryptophan residues at the C7 position. This method utilizes a  N  &#8208;P  t  Bu  2  directing group and tolerates various peptide and alkene substrates. Utilizing internal olefins, this study represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8208;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization. Furthermore, our method provides access to peptide macrocycles with unique Trp(C7)&#8208;alkyl crosslinks and potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides Using Planar
Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a facile synthetic route toward a novel series of imidazolinyl&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanol (UCD&#8208;Imphanol) ligands possessing central and planar chirality. Both sets of diastereomeric ligands were successfully purified by column chromatography. The preliminary application of this family ligands showed excellent activities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition. Enantioenriched pyrrolidines, in a substrate scope of 20 examples, were accessed in high levels of  endo  /  exo  ratios (up to &gt;99/1) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) with excellent yields (up to 99%) by using (  S  ,  S  ,  S  P  )&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol/(  S  ,  S  ,  R  P  )&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule was synthesized, which revealed the existence of negative Gauss curvatures on a &gt;3&#8208;nm molecular structure possessing 192 &#960;&#8208;electrons. &#160;The synthesis&#160; was &#160;facilitated by a protocol developed with Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations and machine&#8208;learning predictions, and spectroscopy and crystallography&#160; were &#160;used to reveal the saddle&#8208;shaped structure of the molecule. Solution&#8208;phase analyses&#160; showed &#160;the presence of dimeric assembly, and crystallographic analyses&#160; revealed &#160;the stacked dimeric structures. The stacked crystal structure&#160; was &#160;scrutinized by various methods, including Gauss curvatures derived from the discrete surface theory of geometry, to reveal the important role of the molecular Gauss curvature in dimeric assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Board&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits board&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and flurophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and board&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the board&#8208;spectrum affinity. The FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The B(C  6  F  5  )  2  substituted borole  2  was obtained from the phenyl bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) borane SMe  2  adduct (  1  &#8729;SMe  2  ) by a synthetic sequence containing a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. Subsequent thermolysis at 50 &#176;C converted it to the bicyclic borenium/ borate zwitterion  3  . Photolysis of  3  gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative  4  &#8231;SMe  2  , which after ligand exchange with N,N&#8208;dimesitylim&#8208;idazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt  6  .

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to  fine&#8208;tune  the function of the designed architecture.  We report here a combinatorial self&#8208;assembly with enPd(NO  3  )  2  and three different ligands (  L  1&#8208;3  ), which gave rise to a family of six palladium&#8208;organic cages  (  C1&#8208;6  ) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (  Pd  5  L  1  2  L  2  ,  Pd  5  L  1  2  L  3  ,  Pd  4  L  2  L  3  ), one new homoleptic (  Pd  4  L  3  2  ) cage, and two known homoleptic (  Pd  6  L  1  4  ,  Pd  4  L  2  2  ) cages  . Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed:  the heteroleptic  cages can form ternary complexes by co&#8208;encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co&#8208;encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Geminal Hydroborative Cyclization of Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed here is the first geminal (  gem&#8208;  ) hydroborative cyclization of enynes. Different from known hydroborative cyclizations, this process adds hydrogen and boron to the same position, leading to a new reaction mode. With [Cp*RuCl]  4  as catalyst, a range of  gem  &#8208;hydroborated bicyclic products bearing a cyclopropane unit could be rapidly assembled from simple enyne substrates. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the reaction mechanism. Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate&#8208;dependence. 1,6&#8208;Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7&#8208;enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne  gem  &#8208;(H,B)&#8208;addition to form an &#945;&#8208;boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au  5  Ag  11  (SR)  8  (DPPOE)  2  and Pt  1  Ag  16  (SR)  8  (DPPOE)  2  with comparable structure features, were controllably synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature &#8213; the Au  5  Ag  11  nanocluster was fluorescent, whereas the Pt  1  Ag  16  nanocluster was phosphorescent. The decay processes of excited electrons of these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Five Lycopodium Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein that by exploiting the commonly shared bicyclic decahydroquinoline motif, a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8208;alkyne cycloisomerization reaction&#160;is developed to access the tricyclic cores in a simple way, which further serve as an advanced platform for the divergent enantioselective collective total syntheses of five&#160;  Lycopodium  alkaloids, belonging to three different structural types, in a concise and protecting group&#8208;free fashion. The key transformations in the second phase include: 1) a transannular reductive Heck cyclization for installation of the azepane ring in fawcettidine, fawcettimine, and lycoposerramine Q; 2) a domino Mukaiyama hydration/Grob fragmentation process for construction of the ten&#8208;membered lactam system in phlegmariurine B; 3) a Fukuyama&#8217;s one&#8208;pot protocol for construction of the 2&#8208;pyridone motif in lycoposerramine R. The newly developed strategy is expected to pave the way to the synthesis of other structurally related  Lycopodium  alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Fluoroalkylphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkenes by&#160;Radical&#8211;Mediated Alkoxyphosphine Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel distal radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine is developed for the first time and applied to the regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated olefins. By employing a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of&#160;(bis)homoallylic alcohols&#65292;organophosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under CFL (compact fluorescence light) irradiation, a series of fluoroalkyl&#8208;phosphorylated alkyl iodides and alcohols are easily synthesized by regiospecific installing a phosphonyl onto the inner carbon of terminal olefins and further iodination/hydroxylation. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration undergoes a distinctive radical cyclization/&#946;&#8208;scission on the lone electron pair of phosphorous, resulting in the C&#8208;P bond formation and C&#8208;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Tunicamycin V and Discovery of a Cytostatic DPAGT1 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A short total synthesis of tunicamycin V (  1  ), a non&#8208;selective phosphotransferase inhibitor, is achieved via a B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction. Tunicamycin V can be synthesized in 15 chemical steps from D&#8208;galactal with 21% overall yield. The established synthetic scheme is operationally very simple and flexible to introduce building blocks of interest. The inhibitory activity of one of the designed analogues  28  against human dolichyl&#8208;phosphate  N  &#8208;acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1) shows 12.5&#8208;times greater than  1  . While tunicamycins are cytotoxic molecules with a low selectivity, the novel analogue  28  displays selective cytostatic activity against breast cancer cell lines including a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper (I) catalysts for C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl&#8208;diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp3)&#8208;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, phenyldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base&#8208;metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazocompounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>PdFe Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Metallene for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene is demonstrated as an effective and robust catalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), delivering an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE). Combined theoretical computations and operando XAS/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and high electrocatalytic stability.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on a Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electrocatalyst, delivering exceptional NRR performance with an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE), as well as a long&#8208;term stability for 100&#8197;h electrolysis. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation via N2&#8208;to&#8208;Fe &#963;&#8208;donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe1 for the NRR.

&lt;p&gt;PdFe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom alloy metallene is demonstrated as an effective and robust catalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), delivering an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE). Combined theoretical computations and operando XAS/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd-coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and high electrocatalytic stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on a Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electrocatalyst, delivering exceptional NRR performance with an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE), as well as a long-term stability for 100&#8197;h electrolysis. In-depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X-ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd-coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation via N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-Fe &#963;-donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the NRR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Rotaxane&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Modal Probes for Cancer Biomarker Imaging**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane&#8208;based platform is introduced for the design of multi&#8208;modality molecular imaging probes. Cooperative capture synthesis with architectural control is used to make viable cancer&#8208;specific imaging agents based on molecularly interlocked rotaxanes that feature radiometal ion complexes for positron emission tomography imaging, fluorescent probes for optical detection, and small&#8208;molecules or monoclonal antibodies for tumour targeting.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules present opportunities to construct therapeutic drugs and diagnostic imaging agents but harnessing supramolecular chemistry to make biologically active probes in water is a challenge. Here, we describe a rotaxane&#8208;based approach to synthesise radiolabelled proteins and peptides for molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers in vivo. Host&#8211;guest chemistry using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208; and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;catalysed cooperative capture synthesis produced gallium&#8208;68 or zirconium&#8208;89 radiolabelled metallo[4]rotaxanes. Photochemical conjugation to trastuzumab led to a viable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. The rotaxane architecture can be tuned to accommodate different radiometal ion complexes, other protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;based drugs, and fluorophores for optical detection. This technology provides a platform to explore how mechanical bonding can improve drug delivery, enhance tumour specificity, control radiotracer pharmacokinetics, and reduce dosimetry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach to the formation of polysubstituted biscyclopropyl methanol derivatives was developed as a new entry to the formation of skipped dienal possessing two distant quaternary carbon stereocenters within acyclic systems with excellent diastereoselectivity







Abstract
The diastereoselective double carbometalation reaction of cyclopropenes provides, in a single&#8208;pot operation, two &#969;&#8208;ene&#8208;[1,1]&#8208;bicyclopropyl ester derivatives. One regioisomer then undergoes a Pd&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl iodide to provide skipped dienes possessing several distant stereocenters including two congested quaternary carbon centers with excellent diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond insertion of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters into secondary benzylic halides is reported. Herein, the carbon chain elongation of acyclic benzylic halides and ring expansion in cyclic versions were realized to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo carbonyl compounds with excellent diastereoselectivity. Computational study charted a specific mechanism involving the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage/re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond.







Abstract
We report a formal carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond insertion via the reaction of secondary benzylic halides (fluorides, chlorides, and bromides) with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters catalyzed by Lewis acid catalysts. Secondary benzylic halides underwent elongation to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;haloesters diastereoselectively. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the present formal C&#8722;C bond insertion was the result of Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage and the re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond and that the aryl&#8208;migration step determined the diastereoselectivity. Various diarylmethyl halides and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters were applicable to this reaction system. In addition, ring expansion in cyclic benzylic chlorides was accomplished.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Parameritannin&#8197;A2, a Branched Epicatechin Tetramer with Two Double Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By overcoming steric constraints, a stereoselective total synthesis of the branched tetramer parameritannin&#8197;A2 was achieved. As a key step of the approach, a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade enabled the de novo construction of the middle flavan unit for its regioselective linkage to the bottom flavan unit.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of parameritannin&#8197;A2 (1), a branched epicatechin (EC) tetramer is reported. The &#8220;phloroglucinol trick&#8221; was used to circumvent two synthetic issues encountered when assembling four EC units, namely, the steric constraint and the formation of the C4&#8722;C6 interflavan linkage. As a substructure of the middle EC unit, phloroglucinol enabled the single&#8208;step assembly of two EC units (top and side) through A&#8208;type linkages. The middle EC unit was constructed by conducting a newly developed three&#8208;carbon flavan annulation via a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade reaction to furnish a trimeric intermediate bearing a thio&#8208;leaving group at C4 position, which allowed the final installation of the bottom EC unit.

         <title>Asymmetric Double Hydroxycarbonylation of Alkynes to Chiral Succinic Acids Enabled by Palladium Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining two distinct phosphine ligands, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes to chiral succinic acids was achieved in a one&#8208;pot manner. The alkyne carbonylation was dictated by the achiral monophosphine to afford branched acrylic acids, while the resulting intermediates further underwent Pd/chiral bisphosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxycarbonylation.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes was developed by using relay catalysis, providing a highly efficient route to chiral succinic acids (41 examples, 76&#8211;94&#8201;%, 94&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). Key to success was the combinatorial use of a Pd precursor with two distinct phosphine ligands in one pot. The synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.

The synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Small&#8208;Molecule Metal&#8208;Carrying Prochelator: A Novel Prodrug Design Strategy for Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimulus&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator was developed as a novel strategy for the prodrug design of metal complexes. The metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation reaction for the in situ synthesis of a bioactive metal complex for targeted therapy.







Abstract
Selective activation of prodrugs is an important approach to reduce the side effects of disease treatment. We report a prodrug design concept for metal complexes, termed &#8220;metal&#8208;carrying prochelator&#8221;, which can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation to synthesize a bioactive metal complex in situ for targeted therapy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we designed a H2O2&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule prochelator, DPBD, based on the strong chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and copper. DPBD can carry Cu2+ (DPBD&#8208;Cu) and respond to elevated H2O2 levels in tumor cells by releasing DTC, which rapidly chelates Cu2+ from DPBD&#8208;Cu affording a DTC&#8211;copper complex with high cytotoxicity, realizing potent antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity. Thus, with its unique intramolecularly triggered activation mechanism, this concept based on a small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can help in the prodrug design of metal complexes.

         <title>Optochemical Control of Therapeutic Agents through Photocatalyzed Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst a rapid trans to cis isomerization for a range of pharmacological agents based&#8208;on an alkene core is achieved. These include combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, allowing their selective in cellulo activation. This provides a new platform for the rapid in situ activation of unmodified pharmacological agents.







Abstract
A Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst is applied to the rapid trans to cis isomerization of a range of alkene&#8208;containing pharmacological agents, including combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, switching their configuration from inactive substances to potent cytotoxic agents. Selective in cellulo activation of the CA&#8208;4 analog Res&#8208;3M is demonstrated, along with its potent cytotoxicity and inhibition of microtubule dynamics.

         <title>Actuation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers at or Below Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers are reported with actuation temperatures at or below ambient temperature are prepared via a sequential thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reaction scheme based on the monomer C6BAPE. The reduction in actuation temperature is accompanied by an increase in actuation rate (&gt;6&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1). The low actuation temperatures achieved are promising for use in many applications at ambient temperature or below.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The large stimuli&#8208;response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare LCE via thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40&#8201;% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1. The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi&#8208;material element.

         <title>Traceless Benzylic C&#8722;H Amination via Bifunctional N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H amination chemistry via traceless bifunctional nitrogen activation is reported. Sequential C&#8722;H aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids affords the products of aryl nitrene insertion into C&#8722;H bonds. These products are unavailable by direct nitrene insertion due to the intrinsic instability of aryl nitrenes. The described method can be applied in the context of pharmacologically active molecules.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8722;H amination methods, however, is currently limited the frequent requirement for the amine precursors to bear activating groups, such as N&#8208;sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8722;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8722;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse N&#8208;functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8722;H N&#8208;aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8722;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8722;H amination, deaminative N&#8722;N functionalization sequences.

         <title>Layered Organic Metal Chalcogenides (OMCs): From Bulk to Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, organic metal chalcogenides are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, which are exquisitely desired but impossible to realize by traditional methods for the synthesis of 2D materials. This Minireview gives a perspective on the structural design of bulk precursors, exfoliation methods, applications, and discusses research directions based on recently published work.







Abstract
The modification of inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with organic functional motifs is in high demand for the optimization of their properties, but it is still a daunting challenge. Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, these materials are extremely desirable but impossible to realize by traditional methods. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous variety in terms of their structure and properties. This Minireview aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are discussed.

This Minireview aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence of Lanthanide in Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskites via Breakdown of the Local Site Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting double perovskites (DPs) suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we develop a new class of NIR&#8208;emitting DPs based on Ln3+&#8208;doped Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6. Benefiting from the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of local site symmetry in the Cs2AgBiCl6  DPs, effective NIR emissions of Ln3+&#160;are realized through Bi3+&#160;sensitization. Specifically, 7.3&#8208;fold and 362.9&#8208;fold enhanced NIR emissions of Yb3+&#160;and Er3+  are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6  DPs relative to those in Na&#8208;free Cs2AgBiCl6  counterparts, respectively. The optimal absolute NIR PLQYs for Yb3+  and Er3+  in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6  DPs are determined to be 19.0% and 4.3%, respectively. Raman spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations verify the sublattice distortion in Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6  DPs via Na+  doping. These findings provide fundamental insights into the design of efficient NIR&#8208;emitting Ln3+&#8208;doped DPs for versatile optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirms its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mutanobactins A, B from the Human Microbiome: Macrocyclization and Thiazepanone Assembly in a Single&#8208;Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first total syntheses of tricyclic mutanobactins A and B, lipopeptides incorporating a thiazepanone, isolated from  Streptococcus mutans  , a member of the human oral microbiome. A rapid, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) based route delivers these natural products from a cascade of cyclization reactions. This versatile process was also employed in a streamlined synthesis of mutanobactin D. Additionally, we provide an independent synthesis of a truncated mutanobactin A analog, utilizing a novel thiazepanone amino acid building block.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Oxyfunctionalization of Functionalized Benzylic Compounds with a Manganese Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst allowing for easy access to synthetically versatile motifs and for modification of bioactive molecules, the chemoselective benzylic oxidation reactions of functionalized alkyl arenes remain challenging. Reported in this study is a new non&#8208;heme Mn catalyst stabilized by a bipiperidine&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, which enables methylene oxidation of benzylic compounds by H2O2, showing high activity and excellent chemoselectivity under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates an unprecedentedly wide range of functional groups, including carboxylic acid and derivatives, ketone, cyano, azide, acetate, sulfonate, alkyne, amino acid, and amine units, thus providing a low&#8208;cost, more sustainable and robust pathway for the facile synthesis of ketones, increase of complexity of organic molecules, and late&#8208;stage modification of drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral MetalOrganic Frameworks by Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that metal&#8208;organic frameworks, based on tetrahedral pyridyl ligands, can be used as a morphological and structural template to form a series of isostructural crystals having different metal ions and properties. An iterative crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal conversion has been demonstrated by consecutive cation exchanges. The primary manganese&#8208;based crystals are characterized by an uncommon space group (  P622  ). The packing includes chiral channels that can mediate the cation exchange, as indicated by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy on microtome&#8208;sectioned crystals. The observed cation exchange is in excellent agreement with the Irving&#8208;Williams series (Mn &lt; Fe &lt; Co &lt; Ni &lt; Cu &gt; Zn) associated with the relative stability of the resulting coordination nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metal cation controls the optical and magnetic properties. The crystals maintain their morphology, allowing a quantitative comparison of their properties at both the ensemble and single&#8208;crystal level.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;containing molecules are mostly derived from ammonia (NH  3  ). Ammonia activation has been demonstrated for single transition metal centers as well as for low&#8208;valent main group species. Phosphinidenes, mono&#8208;valent phosphorus species, can be stabilized by phosphines, giving so&#8208;called phosphanylidenephosphoranes of the type RP(PR&#8217;  3  ). We demonstrate the facile, metal&#8208;free NH  3  activation using ArP(PMe  3  ), affording for the first time isolable secondary aminophosphines ArP(H)NH  2  . DFT studies reveal that two molecules of NH  3  act in concert to facilitate an NH  3  for PMe  3  exchange. Furthermore, H  2  NR and HNR  2  activation is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Biocatalytic Synthesis of Sustainable Surfactants by Selective Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;alkanoyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non&#8208;toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CARmm&#8208;A). CARmm&#8208;A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. &#160;A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CARmm&#8208;A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl&#8208;phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4 via Pd&#7519;+&#8208;assisted Hydrodeoxygenation over CeO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, noble metal doped two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO  2  photoreduction to CH  4  . As a prototype, Pd&#8208;doped CeO  2  nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd  &#948;+  (2 &lt; &#948; &lt; 4) and Ce  3+  &#8208;O  v  are revealed by quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra of D  2  O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8208;OD bond, implying that Pd  &#948;+  sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CHO* and CH  3  O*, thus making CO  2  reduction to CH  4  become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd&#8208;doped CeO  2  nanosheets achieve nearly 100% CH  4  selectivity of CO  2  photoreduction, with the raising CH  4  evolution rate of 41.6 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Helical Assemblies Based on Tartaric Acid&#8208;Derived Acylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical assemblies based on chiral tartaric acid derived acylhydrazones intriguingly exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission through modulation between excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and excimer emissions. By virtue of chirality transfer during the self&#8208;assembly process, an unprecedented ExD inverted or ON/OFF circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch was developed. This type of advanced CPL material can potentially be applicable in higher&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Here, we combined the merits of emergent excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission and circularly polarized luminescence to develop an excitation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence (ExD CPL) material showing unique features. A series of acylhydrazones based on a chiral tartaric skeleton was designed and found to self&#8208;assemble into helical nanostructures through non&#8208;covalent bonds. The helical assemblies showed ExD CPL due to the cooperation of chirality transfer and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Remarkably, not only the emission wavelength could be tuned by the excitation wavelength but the handedness of CPL could be modulated in an inverted or ON/OFF manner as well, thus leading to the first example of an ExD inverted or ON/OFF switchable CPL system. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to explain the inversion of ExD CPL. This work provided a new insight into the unprecedented handedness controllable ExD CPL, which showcased a new paradigm of the advanced CPL materials.

         <title>What Is the Smallest Zeolite That Could Be Synthesized?**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic analysis and molecular simulations indicate that zeolites as small as 4&#8197;nm can be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Compact size&#8208;dependent isomers outcompete zeolites at smaller sizes.







Abstract
Zeolites with a few unit cells are promising as catalyst and adsorbents. The quest to synthesize the smallest zeolites has recently resulted in 4 to 8&#8197;nm nanozeolites, about 2 to 4 unit cells. These findings pose the question of what is the smallest zeolite that could be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Here we address this question using molecular simulations and thermodynamic analysis. The simulations predict that amorphous precursors as small as 4&#8197;nm can crystallize zeolites, in agreement with the experiments. We find that interfacial forces dominate the structure of smaller particles, resulting in size&#8208;dependent compact isomers that have ring and pore distributions different from open framework zeolites. The instability of zeolites smaller than 3&#177;0.5&#8197;nm precludes a classical mechanism of nucleation from solution or through assembly of small nanoslabs.

         <dc:description>
New metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation modes have been observed using divalent SiII atoms bonded to a 1,2&#8208;dicarborane scaffold: while two molar equivalents of the silylene&#8208;phosphine 1 are capable of co&#8208;activating one molecule of white phosphorus, yielding the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the degradation of P4 using the bis(silylene) analogue 3 affords the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene 4 with a Si=P&#8722;Si=P delocalized skeleton.







Abstract
New types of metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation are reported. While the phosphine&#8208;silylene&#8208;substituted dicarborane 1, CB&#8208;SiP (CB=ortho&#8208;C,C&#8242;&#8208;C2B10H10, Si=PhC(tBuN)2Si, P=P[N(tBu)CH2]2), activates white phosphorus in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio to yield the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the analogous bis(silylene)&#8208;substituted compound 3, CB&#8208;Si2, reacts with P4 in the molar ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to furnish the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene (Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8208;containing) compound 4. For the latter reaction, two intermediates having a CB&#8208;Si2P4 and CB&#8208;Si2P2 core could be observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The compounds 2 and 4 were characterized including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Their electronic structures and mechanisms were investigated by density functional theory calculations.

The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) is demonstrated to occur in the absence of any plasmonic mediators, previously considered a paradigm for driving this type of photo&#8208;oxidation. An alternative pathway, based on direct activation of singlet oxygen, is demonstrated. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.







Abstract
The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) has been extensively utilized as a paradigm reaction to probe the role of surface plasmons in nanoparticle&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven processes. Here I report the first observation of the PATP&#8208;to&#8208;DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics either for PATP adsorbed on non&#8208;plasmonic nanoparticles (TiO2, ZnO, SiO2) or deposited as macroscopic droplets. Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon&#8208;free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser&#8208;induced activation of singlet oxygen species. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.

&lt;p&gt;The photodimerization of 4-aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;-dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) is demonstrated to occur in the absence of any plasmonic mediators, previously considered a paradigm for driving this type of photo-oxidation. An alternative pathway, based on direct activation of singlet oxygen, is demonstrated. These results provide new insights in light-driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.

&lt;p&gt;The photodimerization of 4-aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;-dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) has been extensively utilized as a paradigm reaction to probe the role of surface plasmons in nanoparticle-mediated light-driven processes. Here I report the first observation of the PATP-to-DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics either for PATP adsorbed on non-plasmonic nanoparticles (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or deposited as macroscopic droplets.
