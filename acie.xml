         <title>Single&#8208;cell Visualization of Monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplex and Occupied G&#8208;quadruplex Ratio through Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid secondary structure, regulate many biological functions and are considered as potential molecular targets for therapeutics of cancers. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, the regulating mechanism of monogenic G4s is still unclear. Here, we developed a Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells. Two modular probes separately recognize G4 structures and the adjacent RNA sequences, and the module assembly enables imaging of G4s in an individual RNA with high specificity. Through imaging G4s in several individual genes, we found that G4s were steadily occupied by G4 Binding Proteins (G4BPs) in various mRNAs in every cell line and defined &#8220;Occupied G4 Ratio&#8221;. In all, we demonstrated MAMPA was suitable for most experiment situations and found that Occupied G4 Ratios had the potential to become a new parameter for the study of G4s in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isorosthin L and Isoadenolin I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of two  Isodon  diterpenes, isorosthin L and isoadenolin I, are reported. The synthetic strategy features a quick assembly of two simple building blocks through a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and a subsequent radical cyclization for efficient construction of a rather complex advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary stereocenter present in all  Isodon  diterpenes. Oxidative cleavage of the C&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentane enabled the conversion to a lactone moiety which is desired for the construction of the molecular skeleton through reductive coupling with an aldehyde carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Resolution of Configurationally Stable Zwitterionic Pentacoordinate Silicon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereogenic silicon centres in functionalized tetracoordinated organosilanes generally exhibit very high configurational stability under neutral conditions. This stability drops completely when higher coordination states of the silicon center are reached due to rapid substituent exchange. Herein we describe the synthesis of chiral and neutral pentacoordinate silicon derivatives with high configurational stability. The zwitterionic nature of these air and water tolerant species allows for the first time their direct and efficient optical resolution using chiral HPLC techniques. By means of this method, pentacoordinate silicon compounds exhibiting high Si&#8208;inversion have been obtained as single enantiomers. A rationalisation of the enantiomerisation pathways has been also carried out using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Membrane Order and Dynamic Interactions in Living Cells with a DNA Zipper Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell membrane is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure composed of distinct sub&#8208;compartments.&#160; Within these compartments, preferential interactions occur among various lipids and proteins.&#160; Currently, it is still challenging to image these short&#8208;lived membrane complexes, especially in living cells.&#160; In this work, we present a DNA&#8208;based probe, termed &#8220;DNA Zipper&#8221;, which allows the membrane order and pattern of transient interactions to be imaged in living cells using standard fluorescence microscopes.&#160; By fine&#8208;tuning the length and binding affinity of DNA duplex, these probes can precisely extend the duration of membrane lipid interactions via dynamic DNA hybridization.&#160; The correlation between membrane order and the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signalling has also been studied.&#160; These programmable DNA probes function after a brief cell incubation, which can be easily adapted to study lipid interactions and membrane order during different membrane signalling events.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergence of a Promiscuous Peroxidase Under Non&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the substrate induced generation of a transient catalytic microenvironment from a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid in presence of a cofactor hemin. The catalytic state accessed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions showed acceleration of peroxidase activity resulting in degradation of the substrate and subsequently led to disassembly. Equilibrated systems could not access the three&#8208;dimensional microphases and showed substantially lower catalytic activity. Further, the assembled state showed latent catalytic function (promiscuity) to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate. Consequently, the assembly demonstrated protometabolism by exploiting the peroxidase&#8208;hydrolase cascade to augment the lifetime and the mechanical properties of the catalytic state.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of Accessible Protons in Sodalite Cages of Faujasite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6 M of NH  4  NO  3  solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction without conspicuous changes to bulk crystallinity.&#160;The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (H  SOD  ) to supercages (H  SUP  ) can be systematically manipulated from 0 to ca. 1 by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange. The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H&#8208;D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD  2620  / OD  2680  (OD  SOD  / OD  SUP  ). Protons in sodalite cages (H  SOD  ) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (  k  D  ) and cracking (  k  C  ) than protons in supercages (H  SUP  ) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including  k  D  /  k  C  ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Encapsulating N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Ligated Copper Single&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst towards Efficient Methane Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of highly efficient carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst for methane (CH4) electrosynthesis has attracted great attention for the intermittent renewable electricity storage, but remain challenges. Here, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;ligated Copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal organic framework is reported (2Bn&#8208;Cu@UiO&#8208;67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at &#8208;1.5 V vs RHE with a current density of 420 mA cm&#8208;2. Notably, the CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70% within a wide potential range, and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3 s&#8208;1, which almost represents the best molecular catalyst for CH4 electrosynthesis to date. The experimental results show that the &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates. Meanwhile, the porosity of the catalyst facilitates the diffusion of CO2 to 2Bn&#8208;Cu, thereby significantly increasing the availability of each catalytic center. This NHC&#8208;ligated Cu SAS catalyst design has great advantages in CH4 electrosynthesis and provides ideas for the commercial production of CH4.</dc:description>

Here, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-ligated Copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal organic framework is reported (2Bn-Cu@UiO-67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at -1.5 V vs RHE with a current density of 420 mA cm-2. Notably, the CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70% within a wide potential range, and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3 s-1, which almost represents the best molecular catalyst for CH4 electrosynthesis to date. The experimental results show that the &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Dominate Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolite SSZ&#8208;42 &#8211; A Classification of Their Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a remarkable high abundance (~80%) of hydrogen&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), which are deshielded from the  1  H chemical shift of unperturbed BAS at typically 4 ppm. This is due to their interaction with neighboring oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework when oxygen alignments are suitable. The classification and diversity of hydrogen bonding is assessed by DFT calculations, showing that oval&#8208;shaped 6&#8208;rings and 5&#8208;rings allow for a stronger hydrogen bond to oxygen atoms on the opposite ring side, yielding higher experimental chemical shifts (&#948; (  1  H) = 6.4 ppm), than circular 6&#8208;rings (&#948;(  1  H) = 5.2 ppm). Cage&#8208;like structures and intra&#8208;tetrahedral interactions can also form hydrogen bonds. The alignment of oxygen atoms is expected to impact their role in the stabilization of intermediates in catalytic reactions, such as surface alkoxy groups and possibly transition states.</dc:description>

Although many classes of ArMs are known, in vitro reconstitution of cofactors and proteins has been a limiting step in the high&#8208;throughput screening and directed evolution of ArMs because purification of individual host proteins is time&#8208;consuming. We describe the application of a platform to combine mutants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 and the cofactor Ir(Me)MPIX in vivo, by coexpression of the CYP119 mutants with the heme transporter encoded by the hug operon, to the directed evolution of ArMs containing Ir(Me)MPIX in whole cells.

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex (  4  ) as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50 &#8304;C to form N2  , H2,  and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8208;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2  release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Amine&#8208;Reactive Electrophiles&#160;for Selective Profiling of Lysine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteome profiling by activated esters identified &gt;9000 ligandable lysines but they are limited as covalent inhibitors due to poor hydrolytic stability. Here we report our efforts to design and discover a new series of  T  unable  A  mine&#8208;  R  eactive  E  lectrophiles (TAREs) for selective and robust&#160;labeling of lysine. The major challenges in developing selective covalent ligands for lysine are the high nucleophilicity of cysteines and poor hydrolytic&#160;stability. Our work circumvents these challenges by a unique design of the TAREs that form stable adducts with lysine and on reaction with cysteine generate another reactive electrophiles for lysine. We highlight that TAREs exhibit substantially high hydrolytic stability as compared to the activated esters and are non&#8208;cytotoxic thus have the potential to act as covalent ligands. We applied these alternative TAREs for the intracellular labeling of proteins, and for the selective identification of lysines in the human proteome on a global scale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present our studies to construct seven  ent  &#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids by employing a bioinspired two&#8208;phase synthetic strategy. The first phase provided enantioselective and scalable access to five  ent  &#8208;trachylobanes, of which methyl  ent  &#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate was produced on a 300 mg scale. During the second phase, chemical C&#8211;H oxidation methods were employed to enable selective conversion to two naturally occurring higher functionalized  ent  &#8208;trachylobanes. The formation of regioisomeric analogs, which are currently inaccessible via enzymatic methods, reveals the potential as well as limitations of established chemical C&#8211;H oxidation protocols for complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change During the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high&#8208;quality single crystals of 9&#8208;methylanthracene (  9MA  ) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7% along the  c  &#8208;axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon-powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high-quality single crystals of 9-methylanthracene (  9MA  ) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7% along the  c  -axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples. Organic single crystals exhibit well-defined linear expansions during 100% photoconversion, suggesting that this class of solid-state phase change material that could be used for actuation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational flexibility of the protein insertase BamA in the native asymmetric bilayer elucidated with ESR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;&#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) consisting of the central &#946;&#8208;barrel BamA and four other lipoproteins mediates folding of majority of the outer membrane proteins. BamA is placed in an asymmetric bilayer and its lateral gate is suggested to be the functional hotspot. Here we used  in situ  pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy to characterize BamA in the native outer membrane. In the detergent micelles, the data is consistent with mainly an inward&#8208;open conformation of BamA. The native membrane considerably enhanced the conformational heterogeneity. The lateral gate and the extracellular loop 3 exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. The outer membrane provides a favorable environment for occupying multiple conformational states independent of the lipoproteins. Our results reveal a highly dynamic behavior of the lateral gate and other key structural elements and provide direct evidence for the conformational modulation of a membrane protein  in situ  .</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;inspired fragment merging and growing affords efficacious LasB inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extracellular virulence factors have emerged as attractive targets in the current antimicrobial resistance crisis. The Gram&#8208;negative pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  secretes the virulence factor elastase B (LasB), which plays an important role in the infection process. Here, we report a sub&#8208;micromolar, non&#8208;peptidic, fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of LasB discovered by careful visual inspection of structural data. Inspired by the natural LasB substrate, the original fragment was successfully merged and grown. The optimized inhibitor is accessible via simple chemistry and retained selectivity with a substantial improvement in activity, which can be rationalized by the crystal structure of LasB in complex with the inhibitor. We also demonstrate an improved  in viv  o efficacy of the optimized hit in  Galleria mellonella  larvae, highlighting the significance of this class of compounds as promising drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bivalent Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Screening and Intravital Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;induced Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection and quantification of apoptotic cells is a key process in cancer research, particularly during the screening of anticancer therapeutics and in mechanistic studies using preclinical models. Intravital optical imaging enables high&#8208;resolution visualisation of cellular events in live organisms; however, there are few fluorescent probes that can reliably provide functional readouts in situ without interference from tissue autofluorescence. Here we report the design and optimisation of the fluorogenic probe Apotracker Red for real&#8208;time detection of cancer cell death. The strong fluorogenic behaviour, high selectivity, and excellent stability of Apotracker Red make it a reliable optical reporter for the characterisation of the effects of anticancer drugs in cells in vitro and for direct imaging of chemotherapy&#8208;induced apoptosis in vivo in mouse models of breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Activity of Phthalocyanine&#8208;Artesunate Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinic prospect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has not been fully realized due to the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, we designed phthalocyanine&#8208;artesunate conjugates (e.g. ZnPcT  4  A), which could generate up to ca. 10&#8208;fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the known sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. Meanwhile, an interesting and significant finding of aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) was observed for the first time. ZnPcT  4  A showed about 60&#8208;fold higher sonodynamic ROS generation in aggregation form than disaggregation form in aqueous solutions. That could be attributed to the boosted ultrasonic cavitation of nanostructures. The levels of AESA effect depended on the aggregation ability of sonosensitizer molecules and the particle sizes of their aggregates. Moreover, biological studies demonstrated that ZnPcT  4  A had high anticancer activities and biosafety. This study thus opens up a new avenue the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered 2D Halide Perovskites beyond Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#160;Phase: Tailored Interlayer Chemistries for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, as compared to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The mostly studied LHPs are Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier&#8208;transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophyiscal properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promise of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss future directions&#160;to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high&#8208;performance solar cells and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of a &#960;&#8208;Bonded Isomer of [P4]4&#8722; by Aluminyl Reduction of White Phosphorus and its Ammonolysis to PH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of white phosphorus by an aluminum(I) anion is explored. The four&#8208;electron reduction product serves as a means of phosphine gas production on exposure to ammonia.







Abstract
By employing the highly reducing aluminyl complex [K{(NON)Al}]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), we demonstrate the controlled formation of P42&#8722; and P44&#8722; complexes from white phosphorus, and chemically reversible inter&#8208;conversion between them. The tetra&#8208;anion features a unique planar &#960;&#8208;bonded structure, with the incorporation of the K+ cations implicit in the use of the anionic nucleophile offering additional stabilization of the unsaturated isomer of the P44&#8722;fragment. This complex is extremely reactive, acting as a source of P3&#8722;: exposure to ammonia leads to the release of phosphine (PH3) under mild conditions (room temperature and pressure), which contrast with those necessitated for the direct combination of P4 and NH3 (&gt;5 kbar and &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dolabriferol&#8197;C by a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Coupling of a meso&#8208;3,7&#8208;Diketone with Two Chiral Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The carbon skeleton of the precursor was assembled using a novel strategy involving a highly stereoselective three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling that sets the absolute configuration of seven (or eight) stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the noncontiguous polypropionate dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor under mild conditions, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The precursor was prepared by a novel one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling of a meso (Z,Z)&#8208;bisenolate (generated in situ from a 3,7&#8208;diketone) with two enantioenriched aldehydes to set the absolute configuration of seven stereocenters in one step. The first aldol reaction proceeded with enantioselective desymmetrization of the bisenolate to produce an enantiomerically pure enolate&#8211;aldolate. Quenching at this stage enabled a streamlined synthesis of dolabriferol. Addition of a racemic aldehyde to the enolate&#8211;aldolate resulted in aldol coupling with kinetic resolution of the &#8220;matched&#8221; aldehyde; overall, a sequential enantiotopic&#8208;group&#8208;selective (SEGS) bisaldol reaction. Because the desired adduct results from the &#8220;mismatched&#8221; aldol reaction, use of enantioenriched aldehyde was required.

         <title>Water Splitting by C60&#8208;Supported Vanadium Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting of water by a single vanadium is greatly facilitated by a C60 support, which can be regarded as a small piece of porous carbon nanomaterials, especially those with intrinsic pentagonal defects and curvatures. The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.







Abstract
Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60 supported vanadium atom, C60V++H2O&#8594;C60VO++H2. We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+, and observe the formation of H2 as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60&#8208;supported V+, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+ ion by a high energy barrier. The C60 support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60 support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60&#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.

         <title>Evolution of Cationic Vacancy Defects: A Motif for Surface Restructuration of OER Precatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with increasing voltage during the OER process, the structural evolution of cationic defects within NiFe&#8208;LDH, where the simple vacancy VM changes to VMOH and then to the most reactive VMOH&#8208;H, and the surface restructuration, where surface crystalline Ni(OH)x is converted to disordered Ni(OH)x and then to the surface local NiOOH species, are voltage&#8208;regulated concurrent events defining the eventual catalytic performance of the precatalyst.







Abstract
Defects have been found to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe&#8208;LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated via aprotic&#8208;solvent&#8208;solvation&#8208;induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as&#8208;generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as VM (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration VMOH, and eventually transform into VMOH&#8208;H which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, with increasing voltage the surface crystalline Ni(OH)x in the NiFe&#8208;LDH is gradually converted into disordered status; under sufficiently high voltage when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy VMOH&#8208;H. Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage (VM &#8594; VMOH &#8594; VMOH&#8208;H), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe&#8208;LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)x &#8594; disordered Ni(OH)x &#8594; NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect&#8208;induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe&#8208;LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prediction of the activity of a large nano&#8208;catalyst is a challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we developed a theoretical model to build the dependence of activity on generalized coordination number based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In the application on Cu catalytic WGS reaction, the apparent activation energy predicted by our simple model is in close agreement with experiments for particles up to 1000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
For the activity of a nano&#8208;catalyst, a general and quantitative solution to building direct structure&#8211;reactivity relationship has not yet been established. On top of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we developed a model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity. We applied this model to study the nano effects of Cu catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for catalysts with sizes over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional KMC simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic catalyst with size of 877&#8197;nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might be expected. The present model is expected to be useful for systems that are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes.

         <title>Electrophilic Fluorination of Alkenes via Bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein Rearrangement. Access to &#946;&#8208;Difluoroalkyl Boronates</title>

Electrophilic fluorination of alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida species proceeds through bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type rearrangement.







Abstract
The electrophilic fluorination of geminal alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida derivatives proceeds via bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. According to DFT modelling studies this rearrangement occurs with a low activation barrier via a bora&#8208;cyclopropane shaped TS. The Bmida group has a larger migration aptitude than the alkyl moiety in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of the presented electrophilic fluorination reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Control of Spiroketal Formation in Rubromycin Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural snapshots and mechanistic investigation of a key spiroketal synthase provide insights into extensive oxidative backbone rearrangements and spiroketal pharmacophore assembly in rubromycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine as a Reagent for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a biocatalytic approach to the production of fluorinated compounds, halide methyltransferases (HMTs) were found to form fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Although too unstable for isolation, fluorinated SAM was accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) to enable the fluoromethylation of small molecules (see scheme).







Abstract
Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. Herein we introduce S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;S&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of small molecules.

         <title>General Synthesis of Multiple&#8208;Cores@Multiple&#8208;Shells Hollow Composites and Their Application to Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate multiple&#8208;cores@multiple&#8208;shells composite, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. The cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous with the number of cores and shells well controlled. Such a structure shows great promise for superior energy storage, multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential release, and tandem catalysis applications.







Abstract
Rational nanostructure design has proved fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of diverse fields. Especially hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) have stood out due to their temporal&#8211;spatial ordering mass transfer and buffering effect. Localizing multiple cores in a HoMS is highly desired, which could endow it with more fascinating properties. However, such a structure has been barely reported due to the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we develop a controllable synthesis strategy to realize such a structure, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. Additionally, cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous, with the core and shell number well controlled. In&#8197;situ TEM analysis verifies that the inner shell confines the expansion orientation of cores, while the outer shell maintains a stable interface. In addition to energy storage, such structure is also promising for multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential responsive release as well as tandem catalysis applications.

         <title>Thermal and Magnetic Field Switching in a Two&#8208;Step Hysteretic Mn(III) Spin Crossover Compound Coupled to Symmetry Breakings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(III) spin crossover complex with atypical two&#8208;step hysteretic thermal switching at 74 K and 84 K shows rich structural&#8208;magnetic interplay and magnetic field&#8208;induced spin state switching below 14 T with an onset below 5 T. The spin states, structures, and the nature of the phase transitions are elucidated via X&#8208;ray and magnetization measurements. An unusual intermediate phase containing four individual sites, where &#188; are in a pure low spin state, is observed. The splitting of equivalent sites in the high temperature phase into four inequivalent sites is due to a structural reorganization involving a primary and a secondary symmetry&#8208;breaking order parameter that induces a crystal system change from orthorhombic &#8594; monoclinic and a cell doubling. Further cooling leads to a reconstructive phase transition and a monoclinic low temperature phase with two inequivalent low spin sites. The coupling between the order parameters is identified in the framework of Landau theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Role of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family Protein in Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type II polyketide natural products are an important source of novel pharmaceutical molecules. Yet, their biosynthetic pathways and associated mechanisms are still largely under&#8208;explored. In this work, we investigated the biosynthetic pathway of type II polyketide murayaquinone. It has been found that the murayaquinone biosynthetic cluster contains genes for three putative short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes including MrqF  and MrqH  with known functions and MrqM  with unclear function. In particular, we report the functional characterization of MrqM for its role in murayaquinone biosynthesis. Intriguingly, our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is unprecedentedly related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of  mrqM  resulted in the accumulation of an off&#8208;pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. Also, the previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis. The discovery of MrqM as a new type II polyketide cyclase expands our knowledge of the functions of the short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins and opens up new opportunities for type II polyketide biosynthesis study.</dc:description>

Intriguingly, our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is unprecedentedly related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of  mrqM  resulted in the accumulation of an off-pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. Also, the previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis. The discovery of MrqM as a new type II polyketide cyclase expands our knowledge of the functions of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins and opens up new opportunities for type II polyketide biosynthesis study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Commercial Cu2Cr2O5 Decorated with Iron Carbide Nanoparticles as a Multifunctional Catalyst for Magnetically Induced Continuous&#8208;Flow Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercial heterogeneous catalyst is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles to produce a multifunctional catalytic system with magnetic heating capabilities. Under magnetic induction, local hot spots are generated at the catalyst surface, unlocking continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of aromatic ketones under mild conditions. This approach is versatile and potentially transferrable to a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts and transformations.







Abstract
Copper chromite is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles, producing a magnetically activatable multifunctional catalytic system. This system (ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5) can reduce aromatic ketones to aromatic alcohols when exposed to magnetic induction. Under magnetic excitation, the ICNPs generate locally confined hot spots, selectively activating the Cu2Cr2O5 surface while the global temperature remains low (&#8776;80&#8201;&#176;C). The catalyst selectively hydrogenates a scope of benzylic and non&#8208;benzylic ketones under mild conditions (3&#8197;bar H2, heptane), while ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 or Cu2Cr2O5 are inactive when the same global temperature is adjusted by conventional heating. A flow reactor is presented that allows the use of magnetic induction for continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation at elevated pressure. The excellent catalytic properties of ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 for the hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfuralacetone are conserved for at least 17&#8197;h on stream, demonstrating for the first time the application of a magnetically heated catalyst to a continuously operated hydrogenation reaction in the liquid phase.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Functionalization with d0 Early Transition Metals Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a general class of electrocatalysts covering the majority of early transition metals for ambient methane functionalization. The broad applicability of this discovery offers fundamental insights and new opportunities for natural gas utilization.







Abstract
The undesirable loss of methane (CH4) at remote locations welcomes approaches that ambiently functionalize CH4 on&#8208;site without intense infrastructure investment. Recently, we found that electrochemical oxidation of vanadium(V)&#8208;oxo with bisulfate ligand leads to CH4 activation at ambient conditions. The key question is whether such an observation is a one&#8208;off coincidence or a general strategy for electrocatalyst design. Here, a general scheme of electrocatalytic CH4 activation with d0 early transition metals is established. The pre&#8208;catalysts&#8217; molecular structure, electrocatalytic kinetics, and mechanism were detailed for titanium&#8197;(IV), vanadium&#8197;(V), and chromium&#8197;(VI) species as model systems. After a turnover&#8208;limiting one&#8208;electron electrochemical oxidation, the yielded ligand&#8208;centered cation radicals activate CH4 with low activation energy and high selectivity. The reactivities are universal among early transition metals from Period 4 to 6, and the reactivities trend for different early transition metals correlate with their d orbital energies across periodic table. Our results offer new chemical insights towards developing advanced ambient electrocatalysts of natural gas.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Green Process to Synthesize MXene with Controllable Surface Terminations using Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first study to use a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching (MS&#8208;E&#8208;etching) method to synthesize Ti3C2Cl2 without metallic impurities. The Tx surface terminations could be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S in this one&#8208;pot process. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibited a significant increase in capacity.







Abstract
Surface terminations of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti3C2Tx) considerably impact its physicochemical properties. Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8208;F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, good rate performance (91.1&#8201;% at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), and excellent capacitance retention (100&#8201;% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti3C2Tx prepared by other etching methods.

Two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and a n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI) are synthesized, and electron mobility of 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics are achieved by TP&#8208;DMBI doped films, which out&#8208;perform N&#8208;DMBI doped films.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

&lt;p&gt;Two n-type conjugated polymers with different backbones and a n-type dopant 1,3-dimethyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[d]imidazole (TP-DMBI) are synthesized, and electron mobility of 0.53&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power factor 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for n-type organic thermoelectrics are achieved by TP-DMBI doped films, which out-perform N-DMBI doped films.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n-type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor-acceptor n-type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n-type dopant 1,3-dimethyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[d]imidazole (TP-DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP-DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4-(1, 3-dimethyl-2, 3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzoimidazol-2-yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N-DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n-type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N-DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP-DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; than films with N-DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP-DMBI, and 3,4,5-trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n-type organic thermoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Redox Non&#8208;Innocence in Iron&#8211;Carbene Complexes {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11 by 1,2H and 13C Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein are detailed 1/2H and 13C pulse EPR and DFT investigations of an S=1/2 terminal iron&#8211;carbene species. These studies reveal substantial spin density localized at the carbene&#8208;bound Fe center, in contrast with what has been reported to date for radical metal&#8211;carbenoid species. The {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 complex serves as a well&#8208;defined reference compound for comparison to data reported for in situ trapped&#8208;intermediates.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of iron&#8208;carbene complexes in redox states {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11. Pulse EPR studies of the 1,2H and 13C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.

         <title>Direct, Site&#8208;Selective and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tetrahydrofurans via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, THF is activated by visible light irradiation of quantum dots in a direct, site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The resultant &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl radicals, generated from &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H of THF on the surface of QD, enable couple with either &#945;&#8208;amino radical of amine, or addition to chromones and terminal alkynes.







Abstract
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of THF via forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8722;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent.

         <title>Multiplexed Small Molecule Ligand Binding Assays by Affinity Labeling and DNA Sequence Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule binding assays to target proteins are a core component of drug discovery and development. While a number of assay formats are available, significant drawbacks still remain in cost, sensitivity, and throughput. To improve assays by capitalizing on the power of DNA sequence analysis, we have developed an assay method that combines DNA encoding with split&#8208;and&#8208;pool sample handling. The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;linked ligands to a protein target.&#160; Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples . Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein&#8208;labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes. We demonstrate the approach in both ligand displacement and direct binding formats and demonstrate its utility in determination of relative ligand affinity, profiling ligand specificity, and high&#8208;throughput small molecule screening.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the unique morphological and conformational versatility of a biologically active peptide (  PEP&#8208;1  ), which undergoes diverse self&#8208;assembly pathways to form up to six distinct nanostructures and up to four different secondary structures through subtle modulations in pH, concentration and temperature.  PEP&#8208;1  forms twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures and nanofibers at pH 7.4, which transform into fractal&#8208;like structures with strong &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations at pH 13.0 or short disorganized elliptical aggregates at pH 5.5. Upon dilution at pH 7.4, the nanofibers with twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structural elements convert into nanoparticles with random coil conformations. Interestingly, these two self&#8208;assembled states at pH 7.4 and room temperature are kinetically controlled and undergo a further transformation into thermodynamically stable states upon annealing: whereas the twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and corresponding nanofibers transform into 2D sheets with well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;sheet domains, the nanoparticles with random coil structures convert into short nanorods with &#945;&#8208;helix conformations. Notably,  PEP&#8208;1  also showed high biocompatibility, low hemolytic activity and marked antibacterial activity, rendering our system a promising candidate for multiple bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;crossover between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states of selected transition metal ions in polynuclear and polymeric compounds is behind their use as multistep switchable materials in breakthrough electronic and spintronic devices.

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the nuclear&#8208;spin driven magnetization dynamics involving both metal ion and the ligand, for first time, in two HoIII isomorphic single&#8208;molecule magnets, where the behavior is originated from the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in nuclear spin number of protium (I=1/2) and deuterium (I=1).







Abstract
Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported HoIII single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5]3+ to [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(D2O)5]3+. The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of 165HoIII can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes&#8212;respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (1H, I=1/2) and deuterium (2H, I=1).

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus&#8208;Particle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe consisting of a pH and proteolysis sensor enables the simultaneous imaging and quantification of acidification and proteolysis within single phagosomes in live cells.







Abstract
The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharides alter the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases Janus&#8208;particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without Using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncharged univalent and reactive nitrene is captured and stabilized by silylenes. Two nitrene compounds are synthesized and fully characterized. The nitrene character was established by X&#8208;ray analysis, first&#8208;principles electronic structure studies using density functional theory, and natural bond orbital&#8208;based bonding analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;incorporated R1LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR2 (1) [L=PhC(NtBu)2; R1=NTMS2, R2=NTMS]. Compound 1 is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 3.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 2.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at room temperature produced silaimine 2 with a central four&#8208;membered Si2N2 ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment. 1 further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound 3 which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds 1 and 2 have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Photochemical Organocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Conjugate Addition of Allyl Groups to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is disclosed. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then stereoselectively intercepted with high &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, complete chemoselectivity, and moderate to good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.

         <title>Asymmetric Deoxygenative Alkynylation of Tertiary Amides Enabled by Iridium/Copper Bimetallic Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Ir/Cu bimetallic relay catalysis was developed to achieve the challenging asymmetric deoxygenative alkynylation of inert amides under mild conditions, affording a series of synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A variety of inert tertiary amides have been successfully transformed into synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities via a relayed sequence of Ir catalyzed partial reduction and Cu/GARPHOS catalyzed asymmetric alkynylation with terminal alkynes. The reaction was readily extended to some drug molecules and the transformations of representative products have been demonstrated, thus attesting the practical utilities and the robust nature of the protocol.

         <title>Experimental Observation of Hydrocarbon Growth by Resonance&#8208;Stabilized Radical&#8211;Radical Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8211;radical chain reactions may contribute to rapid growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in combustion and astrochemical environments. Phenyl and benzyl radicals were experimentally observed to complete this chain reaction, producing diphenylmethyl and triphenylmethyl radicals by prompt H&#8208;atom loss (see scheme). This observation confirms the plausibility of such chain reactions at high temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
Rapid molecular&#8208;weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8211;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C6H5) and benzyl (c&#8208;C6H5CH2) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Halogenation/Semipinacol Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinyl Oxindoles: A Stereodivergent Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement was realized through a ligand&#8208;controlled stereodivergent kinetic resolution. An array of optically active quinolone derivates and quinoline alkaloids were provided simultaneously by using a chiral Sc(OTf)3/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex as catalyst. The reaction mechanism was proposed to rationalize the reaction process and enantiocontrol.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement of isatin&#8208;derived allylic alcohols has been developed with a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex as catalyst. This strategy involved a pivotal stereodivergent kinetic resolution process and provided a facile and efficient entry to optically active halo&#8208;substituted quinolone derivatives and quinoline alkaloids with a quaternary stereocenter simultaneously under mild reaction conditions. Based on the control experiments together with kinetic studies and DFT calculations, a possible catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction process and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Mediated Inner&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer Induces Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Conjugation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between a redox mediator and molecular Cr complex enables emergent co&#8208;electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. In the reduced forms, the aromatic portions interact through a combination of dispersion forces, &#960; conjugation, and weak coordination of the sulfone to Cr.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is an appealing method for converting renewable energy sources into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. We report a co&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the reduction of CO2 to CO comprised of a molecular Cr complex and dibenzothiophene&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (DBTD) as a redox mediator, which achieves high activity (TOF=1.51&#8211;2.84&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) and quantitative selectivity. Under aprotic or protic conditions, DBTD produces a co&#8208;electrocatalytic response with 1 by coordinating trans to the site of CO2 binding and mediating electron transfer from the electrode with quantitative efficiency for CO. This assembly is reliant on through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between the &#960; frameworks of DBTD and the bpy fragment of the catalyst ligand, with contributions from dispersive interactions and weak sulfone coordination.

         <title>Enantioselective Tertiary Electrophile (Hetero)Benzylation: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution of Isoprene Monoxide with Arylacetates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective benzylation of racemic isoprene monoxide is achieved through a two&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed substitution&#8211;decarboxylation strategy. A variety of electron&#8208;poor (hetero)arylacetates can be used as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to give products with acyclic quaternary stereocenters in 80&#8211;96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The enantioselective generation of quaternary carbon centers remains challenging but is of growing importance for the preparation of functional molecules. Metal catalyzed allylic alkylations of tertiary electrophiles can provide access to these substructures but remain generally incompatible with organometallic benzyl nucleophiles. Here we demonstrate that electron&#8208;deficient arylacetates can serve as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to generate enantioenriched acyclic molecules containing a quaternary carbon center via a two&#8208;step substitution&#8211;decarboxylation process using isoprene monoxide. Products are often obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% ee using a commercially available catalyst. An array of electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups on the arylacetate moiety are tolerated. The lactone generated by the initial substitution reaction can be used in further stereoselective transformations to prepare molecules with acyclic vicinal quaternary stereocenters.

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of charge transfer (CT) interactions between water&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;deficient acceptor and oil&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;rich donor, the formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. With CTCSs as the building block, higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties are produced, which can be used to stabilize and structure liquids.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.

         <title>An on&#8208;surface Diels&#8211;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was demonstrated on&#8208;surface in single molecules of a cyclic strained triyne. The starting material, several intermediates and the product were visualized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is one of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry. However, its use in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesis is hampered by the spatial restrictions of this cycloaddition reaction. Herein we selected a cyclic strained triyne to demonstrate an on&#8208;surface hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a single molecule. The reaction was studied in detail by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Hybrid Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanosheets of Phase Pure n=2: Stabilized Colloids Stored in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confined nanosheets (NSs) of 3D perovskites with a thickness of two lead halide layers can be prepared by using the dodecylammonium/tosylate ligand pair. The addition of Eu&#8208;nanodots to the colloid prevented the NSs from a structural rearrangement and/or coalescence. Deep blue&#8208;emissive colloids were recovered by simply dispersing it in toluene.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nano&#8208;nanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (n=2&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4&#8197;&#956;m lateral size and 2.5&#8197;nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440&#8197;nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (pTS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr2 nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicinal Difunctionalization of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes with Dual Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis was developed involving coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal difunctionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes. The reaction is site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral, tolerating air, moisture and a broad scope of functional groups, which makes this method attractive for modular synthesis of complex heteroarene&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8208;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Surface of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Synthetic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have gained increasing attention for their attractive features. However, the development of 3D COFs is strongly restricted, mainly due to their synthetic difficulty and complicated structure determination. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, which can avoid these problems by incorporating functional moieties into a predetermined framework, provides an alternative way to construct 3D COFs with specific functions. Herein, we report the designed synthesis and characterization of a series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with different loadings of ethynyl groups. Notably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various specific groups onto the pore walls via click reactions. Moreover, the pore surface engineering can accordingly change their properties, e.g., the obtained click products exhibited higher CO  2  /N  2  selectivity. This work described a simple but powerful strategy to build functional 3D COFs, which will certainly advance them for a ranging of interesting applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Two&#8208;Step Access to p&#8208;Extended Naphthyridine Systems &#8211; Potent Building Blocks for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthetic approaches of incorporation of nitrogen into polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in different patterns as stabilising moiety for p&#8208;extended systems and modification tool for optoelectronic properties remains a challenge until today. In this work we developed a new versatile pathway to napthyridine&#8208;based PAHs as non&#8208;symmetric and regioisomeric pendant to pyrazine&#8208;based PAHs. A combination of a gold&#8208;catalysed synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines and the development of an in situ  desulfonation and condensation of these precursors are the key steps of the protocol. The shape and type of attached functional groups of the PAHs can be designed in a late stage of the overall synthetic procedure by the chosen anthranile and backbone of the ynamide introduced in the gold&#8208;catalysed step. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the investigation of electronic properties of the compounds show the influence of the attached substituents. All naphthyridine based PAHs show halochromic behaviour implying their use as highly sensitive proton sensor in non&#8208;protic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Condensed Supramolecular Helices: The Twisted Sisters of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensation of DNA helices into hexagonally packed bundles and toroids represents an intriguing example of functional organization of biological macromolecules at the nanoscale. The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA&#8208;like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA&#8208;like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non&#8208;covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer&#8208;BS superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.</dc:description>

The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA-like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA-like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non-covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer-BS superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Evidence of Subsurface Oxygen Formation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Cu&#160;by X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial in oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) electrocatalysts for enhancing the binding of CO intermediates during CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the presence of such oxygen species under reductive conditions still remains debated. In this work, the existence of subsurface oxygen is validated by grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where OD&#8208;Cu was in&#8208;situ prepared by reduction of Cu oxide with H2&#160;without exposing to air. The results suggest two types of subsurface oxygen embedded between the fully reduced metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath: (i) oxygen staying at lattice defects and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii) interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure.&#160;This study adds convincing support to the presence of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, which previously has been suggested to play an important role to mitigate the &#963;&#8208;repulsion of Cu for CO intermediates in CO2RR.</dc:description>

Both catalytic methods proceed under relatively mild reactions conditions applying to a broad substrate range including more complex compounds providing arylated glucal or isochromene.

         <title>What Distinguishes the Strength and the Effect of a Lewis Acid: Analysis of the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as &#8220;the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation&#8221;. This &#8220;strength&#8221; property was recently specified as &#8220;global Lewis acidity&#8221; (  gLA  ), and is gauged, e.g., by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the &#8220;effect&#8221; on a bound molecule, such as the induced  31  P NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called &#8220;effective Lewis acidity&#8221; (  eLA  ). Unfortunately,  gLA  and  eLA  often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the  strength  and the  effect  of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between  gLA  and  eLA  &#8211; but its correction allows a unification for the first time. Hence, the gained insights allow to answer the question &#8220;  What is the GB number?&#8221;  and push the theory of Lewis acids on a more advanced level. It substantiates the need to describe Lewis acidity by multiple dimensions and provides a rationale for future principles in design and application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile and powerful strategy to prepare libraries of oligothienoacene diimides that include anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers using palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation and an unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration. Through this strategy, a series of oligothienoacene diimides containing 6, 8, and 10 fused rings were synthesized. The molecular geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation have dramatic effects on the electronic properties, degree of crystallinity, and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Notably, single&#8208;crystal microfibers of syn&#8208;3c show electron mobilities up to 4.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, illustrating the significant potential of these materials for organic electronic devices. Our work demonstrates the versatility of this strategy for the development of oligothienoacene diimide libraries, in particular complex and large syn&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, which are difficult to prepare by present methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as a New Class of Promising Cathode Materials for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging post&#8208;lithium battery technology, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have the advantages of large Al reserves and high safety, and have great potential to be applied to power grid energy storage. But current graphite cathode materials are limited in charge storage capacity due to the formation of stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) in the fully charged state. Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resembles graphite in large conjugated &#960; bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculation results show that PAHs can bind AlCl4&#8208; through the interaction between the conjugated &#960; bond in the PAHs and AlCl4&#8208;, forming on&#8208;plane interaction. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three&#8208;ring PAHs, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene owns a high specific capacity of 157 mAh g&#8208;1 (at 100 mA g&#8208;1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8208;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible &#8220;theory guides practice&#8221; research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resembles graphite in large conjugated &#960; bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculation results show that PAHs can bind AlCl4- through the interaction between the conjugated &#960; bond in the PAHs and AlCl4-, forming on-plane interaction. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three-ring PAHs, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene owns a high specific capacity of 157 mAh g-1 (at 100 mA g-1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible &#8220;theory guides practice&#8221; research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry For Modular Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SuFEx click chemistry is a powerful method designed for the selective, rapid and modular synthesis of functional molecules. Classical SuFEx reactions form stable S&#8208;O linkages upon exchange of S&#8208;F bonds with aryl silyl&#8208;ether substrates, and while near&#8208;perfect in their outcome, are sometimes disadvantaged by relatively high catalyst loadings and prolonged reaction times. We herein report the development of &#8216;Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry&#8217; (ASCC), an improved SuFEx method for the efficient and catalytic coupling of aryl and alkyl alcohols with a range of SuFExable hubs. We demonstrate Barton&#8217;s hindered guanidine base (2&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine; BTMG) as a superb SuFEx catalyst that, when used in synergy with silicon additive hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), yields stable S&#8208;O bond linkages in a single step; often within minutes. The powerful combination of BTMG and HMDS reagents allows for catalyst loadings as low as 1.0 mol% and, in congruence with click&#8208;principles, provides a scalable method that is safe, efficient, and practical for modular synthesis. ASSC expands the number of accessible SuFEx products and will find significant application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science .</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to that of surface hydrides, reactivities on interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu  +  , Ag  +  , and Au  +  ), the stable Cu(I) dihydride template [Cu  11  H  2  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  ] (  H  2  Cu  11  ) generates surprisingly three very different compounds; namely [CuH  2  Cu  11  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  ]  +  (  1  ), [AgH  2  Cu  14  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  ((C&#8801;CPh)  6  ]  +  (  2  ), and [AuCu  11  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  Cl] (  3  ).  1  and  2  are both M(I) species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their  H  2  Cu  11  precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal pyramidal hydride coordination mode in an AgCu  3  environment of  2  . The bimetallic cluster of  3  has no hydride and exhibits a mixed&#8208;valent [AuCu  11  ]  10+  metal core, making it a 2&#8208;electron superatom. Thus, depending on the nature of M  +  , trigonal pyramidal hydrides of the  H  2  Cu  11  reactant behave differently. In the cases of M = Cu or Ag, they act as regular 2&#8208;electron ligands. In the case of M = Au, they behave as electron donors, leading to the formation of a 2&#8208;electron superatom, with liberation of H  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)aromatics with a Trifluoromethyl Source and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethoxylated aromatics (ArOCF  3  ) are valuable structural motifs in the area of drug discovery due to the enhancement of the desired physicochemical properties upon the introduction of the trifluoromethoxy group (CF  3  O). Although significant progress has been made recently in the introduction of CF  3  O group into aromatics, current methods either require the use of expensive trifluoromethoxylation reagents or suffer from harsh reaction conditions. Here we present a conceptually new and operationally simple protocol for the direct C&#8211;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)aromatics by the combination of the readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds through the initial generation of CF  3  radical followed by conversion to CF  3  O radical, addition to (hetero)aromatics and rearomatization. The utility of this electrochemical trifluoromethoxylation is illustrated by the direct incorporation of CF  3  O group into a variety of (hetero)aromatics as well as bio&#8208;relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Dimer of Au3 Superatoms Supported by Interlocked Tridentate Scaffolds Formed in Au18S2(SR)12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new sulfur&#8208;containing gold cluster, Au  18  S  2  (STipb)  12  , was serendipitously obtained using the bulky thiol, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzyl mercaptan (TipbSH), as protecting ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au  18  S  2  (STipb)  12  has a deformed octahedral Au  6  core clutched by two tridentate S[Au  2  (STipb)  2  ]  3  units in an interlocked manner. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose that the Au  6  core with two electrons is better viewed as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au  3  (1e) superatoms rather than an electronically closed Au  6  (2e) superatom. In situ formation of the sulfide anions (S  2&#8722;  ) via C&#8211;S bond breakage is ascribed to the steric repulsion between the TipbS ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic optical visualization of proton transport pathways at water&#8208;solid interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probing proton transport is of vital importance for cellular transport, surface catalysis and fuel cells. Conventional proton transport measurements rely on the use of electrochemical conductivity approach which does not allow for direct visualization of proton transport pathways at the nanoscale. Development of novel experimental techniques to spatiotemporally resolve proton transport is in high demand. Here, building upon a general conversion of aqueous proton flux into spatially resolved fluorescence signals, we optically visualize proton transport through nanopores and along the hydrophilic interfaces. We observed a novel phenomenon that the fluorescence intensity increased at negative voltage due to lateral transport. Thanks to the temporal resolution of optical imaging, our technique further empowers the analysis of proton transport dynamics. Our work offers a new toolbox that may shed light on future examination of proton transport phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Recombination and Oligonucleotide Assembly in Peptide&#8208;RNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.







Abstract
The ability of RNA to catalyze RNA ligation is critical to its central role in many prebiotic model scenarios, in particular the copying of information during self&#8208;replication. Prebiotically plausible ribozymes formed from short oligonucleotides can catalyze reversible RNA cleavage and ligation reactions, but harsh conditions or unusual scenarios are often required to promote folding and drive the reaction equilibrium towards ligation. Here, we demonstrate that ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge&#8208;mediated phase separation with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, which shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide&#8208;RNA coaggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions, which can be leveraged to assemble long and complex RNAs from short fragments under mild conditions in the absence of exogenous activation chemistry, bridging the gap between pools of short oligomers and functional RNAs.

&lt;p&gt;In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly-L-lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Combining Electrochemiluminescence Detection with Aptamer&#8208;Gated Indicator Releasing Mesoporous Nanoparticles Enables ppt Sensitivity for Strip&#8208;Based Rapid Tests</title>

         <dc:description>
The best of both worlds in one strip, i.e., electrochemical excitation and luminescence emission, together with aptamer&#8208;gated hybrid nanomaterials enables the detection of penicillin directly in milk at ultra&#8208;trace levels in less than 5&#8197;min with a simple test strip and a mobile communication device.







Abstract
The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50&#177;9 ppt in &lt;5&#8197;min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8220;cap&#8221; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.

         <title>An Efficient Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Nickel Catalyst for the Light Driven Methanation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;based catalyst derived from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was synthesized and studied for the photothermal methanation reaction. The catalyst shows high performance for CH4 production under visible&#8208;IR irradiation. The catalysts also shows high stability and excellent recyclability after several consecutive reaction cycles.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a highly active and stable metal&#8208;organic framework derived Ni&#8208;based catalyst for the photothermal reduction of CO2 to CH4. Through the controlled pyrolysis of MOF&#8208;74 (Ni), the nature of the carbonaceous species and therefore photothermal performance can be tuned. CH4 production rates of 488&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8208;visible&#8208;IR irradiation are achieved when the catalyst is prepared under optimized conditions. No particle aggregation or significant loss of activity were observed after ten consecutive reaction cycles or more than 12&#8197;hours under continuous flow configuration. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we performed an outdoor experiment under ambient solar irradiation, demonstrating the potential of our catalyst to reduce CO2 to CH4 using only solar energy.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into Iron(II) Bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;Bipyridine Skeleton for Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polypyridine Fe&#8208;based skeleton is reported for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction even under 1&#8201;% CO2. Mechanistic insights reveal two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with delocalized electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 addition. Proton&#8208;assisted CO formation is crucial for CO2 reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group switches the transformation to H2 exclusively, which enables self&#8208;sorting syngas formation at flexible CO/H2 ratios.







Abstract
A bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;iron(II) framework (Fe(BPAbipy)) of complexes 1&#8211;3 is reported to shed light on the multistep nature of CO2 reduction. Herein, photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO even at low CO2 concentration (1&#8201;%), together with detailed mechanistic study and DFT calculations, reveal that 1 first undergoes two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 binding over proton. The following 2&#8201;H+&#8208;assisted Fe&#8208;CO formation is rate&#8208;determining for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group (2) initiates PCET for predominant H2 evolution, while an &#945;&#8208;OMe group (3) cancels the selectivity control for either CO or H2. The near&#8208;unity selectivity of 1 and 2 enables self&#8208;sorting syngas production at flexible CO/H2 ratios. The unprecedented results from one kind of molecular catalyst skeleton encourage insight into the beauty of advanced multi&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;proton transfer processes for robust CO2RR by photocatalysis.

         <title>Stacked Reticular Frame Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was achieved in olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via dual confinement of the covalent reticular frame and the noncovalent interlayer stacking.







Abstract
Chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are intriguing as advanced chiroptical materials but have not been reported to date. We constructed chiroptical COF materials with CPL activity through the convenient Knoevenagel condensation of formyl&#8208;functionalized axially chiral linkers and C3&#8208;symmetric 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriacetonitrile. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared chiral COFs showed high absorption and luminescent dissymmetric factors up to 0.02 (gabs) and 0.04 (glum), respectively. In contrast, the branched chiral polymers from the same starting monomers were CPL silent. Structural and spectral characterization revealed that the reticular frame was indispensable for CPL generation via confined chirality transfer. Moreover, reticular stacking boosted the CPL performance significantly due to the interlayer restriction of frame. This work demonstrates the first example of a CPL&#8208;active COF and provides insight into CPL generation through covalent reticular chemistry, which will play a constructive role in the future design of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>Superfast and Water&#8208;Insensitive Polymerization on &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides to Prepare Polypeptides Using Tetraalkylammonium Carboxylate as the Initiator</title>

Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerizations to prepare polypeptides, which can proceed ultrafast in open vessels, aqueous environments and using crude NCAs.







Abstract
We design the tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated superfast polymerization on &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCA) for efficient synthesis of polypeptides. Carboxylates, as a new class of initiator for NCA polymerization, can initiate the superfast NCA polymerization without the need of extra catalysts and the polymerization can be operated in open vessels at ambient condition without the use of glove box. Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated polymerization on NCA easily affords block copolymers with at least 15 blocks. Moreover, this method avoids tedious purification steps and enables direct polymerization on crude NCAs in aqueous environments to prepare polypeptides and one&#8208;pot synthesis of polypeptide nanoparticles. These advantages and the mild polymerization condition of tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerization imply its great potential in functional exploration and application of polypeptides.

         <title>Predesign of Catalytically Active Sites via Stable Coordination Cluster Model System for Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular model catalyst system (Cu3&#8208;X) with predesigned catalytically active sites has been constructed to achieve the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4. The active Cu sites display an appropriate spatial distance, resulting in high faradaic efficiencies.







Abstract
Purposefully designing the well&#8208;defined catalysts for the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 is an extremely important but challenging work. In this work, three crystalline trinuclear copper clusters (Cu3&#8208;X, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) have been designed, containing three active Cu sites with the identical coordination environment and appropriate spatial distance, delivering high selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. The highest faradaic efficiency of Cu3&#8208;X for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion can be adjusted from 31.90&#8201;% to 55.01&#8201;% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO3&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). The DFT calculation results verify that Cu3&#8208;X can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C2H4 product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products with symmetrical molecular structure.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2&#8208;Pyrones with Indenes: Total Syntheses of Cephanolides&#8197;A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 2&#8208;pyrones with electronically unbiased indenes have been realized. This method enables the rapid and enantioselective construction of a wide range of hexahydrofluorenyl bridged&#8208;lactone scaffolds. Based on this method, asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides&#8197;A and B have been accomplished.







Abstract
An inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction could complement the conventional normal&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, catalytic asymmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based IEDDA reactions are underdeveloped. Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric IEDDA reaction using electron&#8208;deficient 3&#8208;carboalkoxyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrones and electronically unbiased indenes as reactants. This method enables the rapid and enantioselective construction of a wide range of hexahydrofluorenyl bridged&#8208;lactone scaffolds. Using this method, asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides&#8197;A and B were accomplished.

         <title>High Density Polyethylenes Bearing Isolated In&#8208;Chain Carbonyls**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a low CO content in the main&#8208;chain of polyethylene along with remarkable isolated carbonyl selectivity was achieved via palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. This polyethylene copolymer retained the main physical properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), while treating the obtained copolymer with UV light resulted in partial degradation. Therefore, the synthesized materials may serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.







Abstract
Polyethylene materials are highly important polymers which are produced in the largest volume among all plastics. Due to the chemical inert property of saturated carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, the degradation of polyethylene is extremely challenging, which prevents them from efficient chemical recycling. Installing functional groups in the main chain of polyethylenes may facilitate the degradation and following chemical recycling of polyethylene materials. Here we report a highly selective approach for the synthesis of high density polyethylenes bearing low content isolated in&#8208;chain carbonyls. Linear high&#8208;molecular weight polyethylene chains are synthesized via the palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. Different from traditional ethylene/CO copolymerization reactions, excellent non&#8208;alternating selectivity has been achieved. While the properties of polyethylene have been retained in the copolymer, faster degradation compared with that of polyethylene was observed upon UV light irradiation. The synthesized materials may therefore serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.

         <title>A Five&#8208;Coordinate Compound with Inverted Ligand Field: An Unprecedented Geometry for Silver(III)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) complex [trans&#8208;(CF3)2AgBr2]&#8722; (16 electron) undergoes a marked stereochemical change upon coordination of an additional Br&#8722; ligand. The resulting five&#8208;coordinate [(CF3)2AgBr3]2&#8722; complex (18 electron) exhibits trigonal bipyramidal geometry, which is unprecedented for AgIII. This five&#8208;coordinate compound also exhibits inverted ligand field.







Abstract
By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh4][trans&#8208;(CF3)2AgX2] [X=Cl (1&#8201;a), Br (2&#8201;a)]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro&#8208;derivative 1&#8201;a have been unambiguously established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the cis&#8208;/trans&#8208;[(CF3)2AgX2]&#8722; couples (X=F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a appear to be kinetically favored stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X&#8722; ligand affording rare five&#8208;coordinate AgIII species [(CF3)2AgX3]2&#8722;. Interestingly, compound [PPh4]2[(CF3)2AgBr3] (3) has been identified by SC&#8208;XRD methods as the first AgIII derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular. This unusual five&#8208;coordinate species also exhibits inverted ligand field.

&lt;p&gt;By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square-planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] [X=Cl (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), Br (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;)]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro-derivative &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; have been unambiguously established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; couples (X=F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; appear to be kinetically favored stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligand affording rare five-coordinate Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Interestingly, compound [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) has been identified by SC-XRD methods as the first Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular. This unusual five-coordinate species also exhibits inverted ligand field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastable Cu Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Liquid Fuels by Tuning C&#8211;C Coupling with CuTi Subsurface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy enable electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon liquid fuels including ethanol, acetone and n&#8208;butanol with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).







Abstract
Production of multicarbon (C2+) liquid fuels is a challenging task for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, mainly limited by the stabilization of reaction intermediates and their subsequent C&#8722;C couplings. In this work, we report a unique catalyst, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy (a&#8208;CuTi@Cu) toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon (C2&#8208;4) liquid fuels. Remarkably, the electrocatalyst yields ethanol, acetone, and n&#8208;butanol as major products with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which can be maintained for at least 3&#8197;months. Theoretical simulations and in situ characterization reveals that subsurface Ti atoms can increase the electron density of surface Cu sites and enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate, which in turn reduces the energy barriers required for *CO dimerization and trimerization.

         <title>Tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin: A Promising Precursor of Directly Fused Porphyrin(2.1.1.1) Dimer and meso&#8208;&#945; Fused N&#8208;Confused Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalation of tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin afforded novel fused porphyrin dimers such as porphyrin(2.1.1.1) dimer bis&#8208;ZnII complex and N&#8208;confused porphyrin dimer bis&#8208;NiII complex through metalation&#8208;induced transannular C&#8722;C bond formation. Both of these complexes showed macrocyclic 36&#960; conjugation, exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively.







Abstract
3,7,23,27&#8208;Tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin 2 was synthesized as a novel octaphyrin bearing two meso&#8208;free positions. Surprisingly, its ZnII and NiII complexation reactions produced a directly fused porphyrin(2.1.1.1) dimer 6, and a meso&#8208;&#945; fused N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) dimer 7, as the first example of NCP tape, respectively, via transannular C&#8722;C bond formation. While 6 exhibits a diatropic ring&#8208;current effect owing to the global 36&#960; M&#246;bius aromaticity, 7 shows a paratropic ring&#8208;current effect due to the global H&#252;ckel 36&#960; antiaromaticity. In addition, the oxidation of 7 with PbO2 allowed for formation of its two&#8208;electron oxidized species 9 that exhibited a diatropic ring&#8208;current effect due to the global H&#252;ckel 34&#960; aromaticity. This work has demonstrated that meso&#8208;free large expanded porphyrins can be a promising platform to produce novel fused porphyrinoids.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Assembled Film from Semiconductor Nanorods with Ultra&#8208;Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods were assembled into chiral films using the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. The CdSe/CdS nanorods films displayed intense circular dichroism response and circularly polarized luminescence signals, which can be adjusted by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers.







Abstract
Chiroptical nanomaterials have generated significant levels of interest for generating strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. We used the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique to generate the continuous and compact assembly of CdSe/CdS chiral film. We assembled achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers. This allowed us to tailor chiroptical properties to achieve high CPL signals. The chiral film was symmetrical and had the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and CPL signals with ten layers (RH (right&#8208;handed)&#8208;/LH (left&#8208;handed)&#8208;5 + 5 layers) and a 45&#176; inter&#8208;angle. Specifically, RH&#8208;5+5 of the chiral film exhibited 1431 mdeg of CD activity and strong CPL signals with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.0997. The helical stacked crystal plates with linear birefringence resulted in strong circular birefringence, as determined by the Reusch model. Electromagnetic simulations indicated that such remarkable optical activity was attributed to the birefringence and dichroism of the well&#8208;aligned CdSe/CdS nanorod layers in the chiral films. Under right/left circular polarized (RCP/LCP) light excitation, the well aligned semiconductor nanorods exhibited differences in the coupling efficiencies to RCP and LCP light. Our CdSe/CdS chiral films, which exhibit ultra&#8208;strong CPL activity, will provide a novel strategy for the fabrication of chiroptical devices.

         <title>General Tolerance of Galactosyltransferases toward UDP&#8208;galactosamine Expands Their Synthetic Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of diverse glycans is essential to glycobiology, while synthetically useful enzymes for this purpose are limited. This study discovered a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases (GalTs) toward uncommon donor UDP&#8208;galactosamine. A two&#8208;step strategy was devised to harness this property for the facile synthesis of GalNAc&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Accessing large numbers of structurally diverse glycans and derivatives is essential to functional glycomics. We showed a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases toward uridine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;galactosamine (UDP&#8208;GalN), which is not a commonly used sugar nucleotide donor. The property was harnessed to develop a two&#8208;step chemoenzymatic strategy for facile synthesis of novel and divergent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)&#8208;glycosides and derivatives in preparative scales. The discovery and the application of the new property of existing glycosyltransferases expand their catalytic capabilities in generating novel carbohydrate linkages, thus prompting the synthesis of diverse glycans and glycoconjugates for biological studies.

         <title>Chiral Heterogeneous Scandium Lewis Acid Catalysts for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts that demonstrate excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles have been developed. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO2 as support were utilized for the preparation. Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved by tuning the chiral ligands.







Abstract
While continuous&#8208;flow reactions with chiral heterogeneous catalysts provide a highly efficient method to synthesize optically active compounds, chiral heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis has been less extensively explored. We have developed the first example of chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts, which demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO2 as support were utilized for the synthesis. The heteropoly acid was found to be crucial for the preparation, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. The chiral ligand could be easily tuned without chemical modification and the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#8722;Ge Coupling of Aryl/Alkenyl Electrophiles with Chlorogermanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;Ge bond&#8208;forming framework was established, which bridges a gap between a recently developed mild coupling technique and organogermane chemistry. The method provides a mild approach for the synthesis of both aryl and alkenyl germanes, with improved molecular diversity and structural complexity, using readily available carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes as starting materials.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling has emerged as a promising tool for molecular synthesis; however, current studies have focused mainly on forging C&#8722;C bonds. We report a cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;Ge coupling reaction and thereby demonstrate the possibility of constructing organogermanes from carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers access to both aryl and alkenyl germanes. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of the &#8208;GeR3 moiety into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organogermanes are demonstrated.

         <title>Is Organic Chemistry Really Growing Exponentially?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of reaction examples increases exponentially but the number of new reaction types grows only linearly or sub&#8208;linearly. We re&#8208;use the most familiar and popular reaction classes although we also discover more complex transformations. Analysis of reaction&#8208;type dynamics is useful to estimate numbers of meaningful machine&#8208;learning models that can be constructed and for tracing suspicious/erroneous entries in databases.







Abstract
In terms of molecules and specific reaction examples, organic chemistry features an impressive, exponential growth. However, new reaction classes/types that fuel this growth are being discovered at a much slower and only linear (or even sublinear) rate. The proportion of newly discovered reaction types to all reactions being performed keeps decreasing, suggesting that synthetic chemistry becomes more reliant on reusing the well&#8208;known methods. The newly discovered chemistries are more complex than decades ago and allow for the rapid construction of complex scaffolds in fewer numbers of steps. We study these and other trends in the function of time, reaction&#8208;type popularity and complexity based on the algorithm that extracts generalized reaction class templates. These analyses are useful in the context of computer&#8208;assisted synthesis, machine learning (to estimate the numbers of models with sufficient reaction statistics), and identifying erroneous entries in reaction databases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Metalation of Porphyrins at the Solid&#8211;Gas Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic self&#8208;metalation of tetrapyrroles at surfaces can be promoted by oxygen at the solid&#8211;gas interface already at room temperature, lowering the reaction barrier as in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100).







Abstract
Self&#8208;metalation is a promising route to include a single metal atom in a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle in organic frameworks supported by metal surfaces. The molecule&#8211;surface interaction may provide the charge transfer and the geometric distortion of the molecular plane necessary for metal inclusion. However, at a metal surface the presence of an activation barrier can represent an obstacle that cannot be compensated by a higher substrate temperature without affecting the layer integrity. The formation of the intermediate state can be facilitated in some cases by oxygen pre&#8208;adsorption at the supporting metal surface, like in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100). In such cases, the activation barrier can be overcome by mild annealing, yielding the formation of desorbing products and of the metalated tetrapyrrole. We show here that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;TPP at the Pd(100) surface can be promoted already at room temperature by the presence of an oxygen gas phase at close&#8208;to&#8208;ambient conditions via an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hindrance of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode via Surface Gradient Penetration of Tantalum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ta doping created some low&#8208;valence Ni, decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between transition metal and Li+, thus the Li+ diffusion energy barrier has been decreased and the kinetic hindrance was mitigated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low specific capacity due to the severe kinetic hindrance at the nondilute state during Li+ intercalation. Herein, combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that this obstacle can be tackled by regulating the oxidation state of nickel via injecting high&#8208;valence foreign Ta5+. The as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 delivers a high specific capacity (211.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C), high initial Coulombic efficiency (93.8&#8201;%), excellent rate capability (157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8201;C), and good durability (90.4&#8201;% after 100 cycles under 0.5&#8201;C). This work provides a strategy to mitigate the Li+ kinetic hindrance of the appealing single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and will inspire peers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>La3Ga3Ge2S3O10: An Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxysulfide Designed by Anion&#8208;Directed Band Gap Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen anions possess high polarizability leading to strong SHG response, but their high energy levels prevent us from pushing the optical windows into UV regions. The anion&#8208;directed band gap engineering associated with O/S anion order yields the novel UV nonlinear optical oxysulfide La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 with an exceptionally large band gap of 4.70&#8197;eV. The oxysulfide exhibits phase matching behaviors with SHG intensity twice that of KH2PO4.







Abstract
Chalcogenide&#8208;containing compounds have been widely studied as infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, they have never been applied in the ultraviolet (UV) region owing to the high energy levels of chalcogen anions, leading to band gap narrowing. We report the synthesis of a new UV NLO oxysulfide La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 with an exceptionally wide band gap of 4.70&#8197;eV due to from the unique anion&#8208;ordered frameworks comprising 1D 1&#8734;[(Ga3/5Ge2/5)3S3O3] triangular tubes and 0D (Ga3/5Ge2/5)2O7 dimers of corner&#8208;sharing (Ga/Ge)S2O2 and (Ga/Ge)O4 tetrahedra, respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements revealed that La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 was phase matchable with twice the SHG response of KH2PO4. The results of theoretical calculations suggest that the strong SHG response is mainly attributable to the S&#8208;3p and O&#8208;2p orbitals in the occupied states. The anion&#8208;directed band&#8208;gap engineering may give insights into the application of NLO oxychalcogenides in the UV regions.

         <title>Terpolymerization of Ethylene and Two Different Methoxyaryl&#8208;Substituted Propylenes by Scandium Catalyst Makes Tough and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence&#8208;controlled terpolymers of ethylene and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;functionalized propylenes synthesized with a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst exhibited excellent elasticity and remarkable self&#8208;healing because of the unique synergistic effects of the multiple components.







Abstract
The terpolymerization of a non&#8208;polar olefin (such as ethylene) and two different polar functional olefins in a controlled fashion is of great interest and importance but has hardly been explored to date. We report for the first time the terpolymerization of ethylene (E) and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;substituted propylenes (AR1P=hexylanisyl propylene; AR2P=methoxynaphthyl propylene or methoxypyrenyl propylene) by a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. The terpolymerization took place in a sequence&#8208;controlled fashion, affording unique multi&#8208;block copolymers composed of two different ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methoxyarylpropylene sequences E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P (soft segments) and E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P (hard segments) and relatively short ethylene&#8211;ethylene (EE) blocks (crystalline segments). The terpolymers exhibited excellent elasticity and unprecedented self&#8208;healing as a result of microphase separation of nanodomains of the crystalline EE segments and the hard amorphous E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P segments from a very flexible E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P matrix, demonstrating unique synergy of the three different components.

         <title>An Unsymmetrical, Cyclic Diborene Based on a Chelating CAAC Ligand and its Small&#8208;Molecule Activation and Rearrangement Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot synthesis of a CAAC&#8208;stabilized, unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was achieved via consecutive two&#8208;electron reduction steps from an adduct of CAAC and B2Br4(SMe2)2. Theoretical studies revealed that this diborene has a considerably smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap than those of reported NHC&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;supported diborenes. Complexation of the diborene with [AuCl(PCy  3  )] afforded two diborene&#8208; AuI  &#960; complexes, while reaction with DurBH2, P4  and a terminal acetylene led to the cleavage of B&#8208;H, P&#8208;P, and C&#8208;C &#960; bonds, respectively. Thermal rearrangement of the diborene gave an electron&#8208;rich cyclic boraketene, which readily coordinated to Ag  I  via its B=C double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Tardigrade Proteins Self&#8208;Assemble into Fibrous Gels in Response to Environmental Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tardigrades are remarkable for their ability to survive drastic stress conditions as diverse as extreme temperature and desiccation. The molecular mechanisms that confer this unusual resistance to physical stress remain unknown. Recently, tardigrade&#8208;unique intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to play an essential role in tardigrade anhydrobiosis. Here, we characterize the conformational and physical behaviour of CAHS&#8208;8 from  Hypsibius exemplaris.  NMR spectroscopy reveals that the protein comprises an extended central helical domain, flanked by disordered termini. Upon concentration, the protein is shown to successively form oligomers, long fibres and finally gels constituted of fibres, in a strongly temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The helical domain forms the core of the fibrillar structure, with the disordered termini remaining highly dynamic within the gel. Soluble proteins can be encapsulated within cavities in the gel, maintaining their functional form. The ability to reversibly form fibrous gels may be associated with the enhanced protective properties of these proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly durable and fully dispersed Co diatomic site catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts such as almost 100% atomic efficiency and excellent hydrocarbon selectivity. Herein, Co&#8208;based atom site catalysts with Co  2  &#8211;N coordination structure have been synthesized and used for photo&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction firstly, and the resulted CoDAC containing 3.5% Co atom demonstrates superior atom ratio for the best CO  2  reduction catalytic performance with 65.0% CH  4  selectivity, far exceeding that of Co&#8208;based single&#8208;atom site catalysts (CoSACs). The intrinsic reason for superior activity of CoDACs is excellent adsorption strength of CO  2  and CO* intermediates at dimeric Co active sites, which is much more beneficial for CH  4  production than that of CoSACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Condensed Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals: Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Structural Defects for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional polymerization for the synthesis of carbon nitride usually generates amorphous heptazine&#8208;based melon with an abundance of undesired structural defects, which function as charge carrier recombination centers to decrease the photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structure defects was obtained by conducting the polycondensation in a mild molten salt of LiCl/NaCl. The melting point of the binary LiCl/NaCl system is around 550  o  C, which substantially restrain the depolymerization of triazine units and extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The optimized polymeric carbon nitride crystal exhibits a high apparent quantum efficiency of 12%  (  &#955;=365nm) for hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting, owing to the efficient exciton dissociation and the subsequent fast transfer of charge carriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Double Hydroxide&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Prussian Blue Membranes for Precise Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian Blue (PB), which was first discovered as robust blue&#8208;colored pigment in the year 1706, has shown promising prospects in disease treatment, energy conversion, water splitting, and sensing. Relying on the uniform 3.2 &#197;&#8208;sized pore channels as well as high stability in aqueous environments, in this study, we pioneered in situ preparation of polycrystalline PB membranes to justify their dye rejection and metal ion discrimination ability in aqueous environments. Among various factors, the introduction of calcined NiFe layered double hydroxide buffer layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  substrates was found to play a paramount role in the formation of continuous polycrystalline PB membranes, thereby leading to excellent dye rejection efficiency (&gt;99.0%). Moreover, prepared PB membranes enabled discriminating different monovalent metal ions (e.g., Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  ) depending on their discrepancy in Stokes diameters, showing great promise for lithium extraction from smaller&#8208;sized metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascaded Nanozyme system with High Reaction Selectivity by Substrate Screening and Channeling in a Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surpassing natural enzymes in cost, stability and mass production, nanozymes have attracted wide attention in fields from disease diagnosis to tumor therapy. However, nanozymes intrinsically have low reaction selectivity, which significantly restricts their broad applications. Here we report a general method to address this challenge by following a biomimetic operation principle of substrates channeling and screening. Two oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymes, i.e., emerging N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanoparticles, were cascaded as a proof of concept to improve the reaction selectivity in transforming the substrate into the targeted product against the interferences by more than 2000 times. The cascaded nanozymes were also adopted to a spatially confined microfluidic device, leading to more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement of the reaction efficiency due to signal amplification. Beyond the structured matters, we highlight the general utility of the operation principle in biology to endow nanozymes with remarkable selectivity and efficiency as well simplicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Clinical Development of Metal Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has emerged over the last decades as one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the most commonly used techniques (i.e. surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy), increasing attention has been devoted towards photodynamic therapy. However, the vast majority of clinically applied photosensitisers are not ideal and associated with several limitations including poor aqueous solubility, poor photostability and slow clearance from the body, causing photosensitivity. In an effort to overcome these drawbacks, much attention has been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. Herein, the clinical development of metal containing compounds including Purlytin  &#174;  , Lutrin  &#174;  /Antrin  &#174;  , Photosens  &#174;  , TOOKAD  &#174;  soluble or TLD&#8208;1433 is critically reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Luminescence and Cooperative Sensitisation Upconversion of Lanthanide Complexes in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upconversion nanoparticles have led to various breakthrough applications in solar energy conversion, imaging, and biomedicine. One key impediment is the facilitation of such processes at the molecular scale in solution where quenching effects are much more pronounced. In this work, molecular solution&#8208;state cooperative luminescence (CL) upconversion arising from a Yb excited state is explored and the mechanistic origin behind cooperative sensitisation (CS) upconversion in Yb/ Tb systems is investigated. Counterintuitively, the best UC performances were obtained for Yb/Tb ratios close to parity, resulting in the brightest molecular upconversion complexes with a quantum yield of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8208;6 at a low laser power density of 2.86 W/cm2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in the mechanistic study of newly developed piezocatalysis systems. The differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the tentative mechanisms of energy band theory and screening charge effect are elaborated. The current challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are provided.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis, a newly emerging catalysis technology that relies on the piezopotential and piezoelectric properties of the catalysts, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism of piezocatalysis is still under debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are highlighted. Hopefully, this Review can help readers gain a better understanding of piezocatalysis and enable its application in their own research.

A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are highlighted. Hopefully, this Review can help readers gain a better understanding of piezocatalysis and enable its application in their own research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Silica/AAO Hybrid Membrane with Enhanced Permselectivity for Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Sensitive Smart Ion Transport</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anode alumina oxide (MCS/AAO) hybrid membrane by interfacial super&#8208;assembly is reported. The MCS/AAO hybrid membrane with enhanced permselectivity exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and superior temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;sensitive salinity gradient energy conversion performance.







Abstract
Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation was obtained by interfacial super&#8208;assembly method. A maximum power density of 5.04&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicting Therapeutic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) is developed for real&#8208;time reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;activated cancer therapy by ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. The nanoplatform can self&#8208;monitor the activation of nanozymes during cancer therapy, which has potential to predict therapeutic effects in vivo and guide nanoenzymes in personalized cancer treatment.







Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application. However, there is a lack of facile approach for evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles, which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM), the catalytic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric signals of NIRF (FL695/FL825) and PA (PA680/PA780), which may provide new ideas for predicting anticancer efficacy of nanozymes in living system.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Templating Growth of Homeostatic GeP Nano&#8208;Bar Corals with Fast Electron&#8208;Ion Transportation Pathways for High Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An in situ template method is proposed to directionally induce the construction of corals of GeP nanobars featuring high aspect ratio, plentiful exposed facets for rapid Li+ transport, and a self&#8208;healable homeostatic ability to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability.







Abstract
We propose an in situ template method to directionally induce the construction of germanium phosphide nanobar (GeP&#8208;nb) corals with an adjustable aspect ratio. The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron&#8208;ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics. The customized GeP&#8208;nb electrode delivers a self&#8208;healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing GeP crystalline structure through multi&#8208;phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles). As a result, the GeP&#8208;nb presents the highest Li+ diffusion coefficient (6.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) among all the Ge&#8208;based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anode.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Difunctionalization of Cyclohexenyl Triflates: Direct Access to Versatile Cyclohexenes via Cyclohexynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates, via strained cyclic alkyne intermediates generated in situ. The importance and utility of this method is exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.







Abstract
Difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkynes presents a powerful strategy to build richly functionalized cyclic alkenes in an expedient fashion. Herein we disclose an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates. We have demonstrated the novel use of zincate base/nucleophile system for effective formation of key cyclohexyne intermediates and selective addition of various carbon and nitrogen nucleophiles. Importantly, leveraging the resulting organozincates enables the incorporation of a broad range of electrophilic partners to deliver structurally diverse cyclohexene motifs. The importance and utility of this method is also exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Cu&#8208;Doped SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n Heterostructure That Shows Significant Raman Enhancement**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF &gt;1010. SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was then developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs recorded in a barcode demonstrated practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.







Abstract
Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46&#215;1010. This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge-like Cu-doping SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO p-n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu), was first created as a CM-based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge-separation efficacy of p-n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner-reference element, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework is realized by hierarchical assembly in water. The coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligand to the zinc porphyrin subunits of a monolayer supramolecular network has been utilized to selectively produce ordered bilayer supramolecular architectures with controlled thickness.







Abstract
Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the cooperative coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smallest all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected silver superatom, Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ has an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure. It can adsorb CO2 in the air and exhibits high activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, with FE reaching 95&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. DFT calculations show that the under&#8208;coordinated Ag atom on Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one ligand releasing from the cluster surface is the active species.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that Ag15 possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that Ag15 can adsorb CO2 in the air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into CO with a faradaic efficiency of ca. 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V and a maximal turnover frequency of 6.37&#8197;s&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO formation.

         <title>Heavily Tungsten&#8208;Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;mechanistic strategy for tailoring the composition of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed. Both exhibit exceptionally low activation energies and enhanced room&#8208;temperature (RT) ionic conductivities; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm, respectively.







Abstract
A strategy for modifying the structure of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm. At &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5&#8197;mS/cm. The 30&#8201;% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8211;12&#8201;% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo&#8208;cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na&#8208;ions. An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) using Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 as the primary SSE and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;Polymer Heterostructure with Ordered In&#8208;Plane Mesochannels for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure with ordered in&#8208;plane cylindrical mesochannels. The resultant 2D heterostructure shows top&#8208;level CDI performance in its application as electrode material for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
The application of traditional electrode materials for high&#8208;performance capacitive deionization (CDI) has been persistently limited by their low charge&#8208;storage capacities, excessive co&#8208;ion expulsion and slow salt removal rates. Here we report a bottom&#8208;up approach to the preparation of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure having ordered in&#8208;plane mesochannels (denoted as mPDA/MXene). Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) monolayers on MXene nanosheets leads to the mPDA/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits several unique features: (1)&#8197;MXene undergoes reversible ion intercalation/deintercalation and possesses high conductivity; (2)&#8197;mPDA layers establish redox capacitive characteristics and Na+ selectivity, and also help to prevent self&#8208;stacking and oxidation of MXene; (3)&#8197;in&#8208;plane mesochannels enable the smooth transport of ions at the internal spaces of this stacked 2D material. When applied as an electrode material for CDI, mPDA/MXene nanosheets exhibit top&#8208;level CDI performance and cycling stability compared to those of the so far reported 2D materials. Our study opens an avenue for the rational construction of MXene&#8208;organic hybrid heterostructures, and further motivates the development of high&#8208;performance CDI electrode materials.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Ammonia from Its Elements Down to Atmospheric Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis over Fe catalysts promoted by alkali metals, especially Rb or Cs, is possible under ball milling. The reaction proceeds at appreciable rates at room&#8208;temperature and down to atmospheric pressure in a continuously operating system under gas flow.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis via the high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure Haber&#8208;Bosch process is one of the most important chemical processes in the world. In spite of numerous attempts over the last 100&#8197;years, continuous Haber&#8208;Bosch type ammonia synthesis at room&#8208;temperature had not been possible, yet. We report the development of a mechanocatalytic system operating continuously at room&#8208;temperature and at pressures down to 1&#8197;bar. With optimized experimental conditions, a cesium&#8208;promoted iron catalyst was shown to produce ammonia at concentrations of more than 0.2&#8197;vol.&#8201;% for over 50&#8197;hours.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Crosslinked Polymer Networks for Highly E&#64256;ective Iodine Adsorption from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks designed for iodine capture is reported. These materials were prepared by Sonogashira coupling of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;alkynylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole with bishalide building blocks with different electronic properties and molecular sizes. Despite their low Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface areas, iodine vapor adsorption capacities of up to 3.38 g g&#8208;1 were seen, a finding ascribed to the presence of a large number of e&#64256;ective sorption sites including macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;rich cavities, aryl units, and alkyne groups within the material. One particular system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective at iodine capture from water (uptake capacity of 3.24 g g&#8208;1 from a concentrated aqueous KI/I2 solution at ambient temperature). Fast capture kinetics (kobs = 7.814 g g&#8208;1 min&#8208;1) were seen.. Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP is able to remove 93.2% of iodine from an aqueous source phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying the Conversion Mechanism to Broaden Cathode Options in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25114-25121, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in CuI cathodes were studied. This direct conversion mechanism can be generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality, which enriches the Zn2+ storage mechanism and broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn2+ storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn2+ intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn2+ intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Thick Wafer&#8208;Size NiO Films with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25020-25027, November 15, 2021. </description>

An atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy allows wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films to be grown with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. The sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior.







Abstract
Adding ferromagnetism into semiconductors attracts much attentions due to its potential usage of magnetic spins in novel devices, such as spin field&#8208;effect transistors. However, it remains challenging to stabilize their ferromagnetism above room temperature. Here we introduce an atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy to grow wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. Surface lattice defects break the magnetic symmetry of NiO and produce surface ferromagnetic behaviors. Our sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 157&#8197;emu/cc and coercivity of 418&#8197;Oe. Attributed to wafer size, the easily&#8208;transferred NiO thin film is further verified in a magnetoresistance device. Our work provides a sub&#8208;nanometric platform to produce wafer&#8208;size ferromagnetic NiO thin films as atomic layer magnetic units in future transparent magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surfaces by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>

Based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system, a bare gold surface which has chiral phases was shown to prefer the adsorption of D&#8208;type amino acid without relying on the organic selector layer on the surface.







Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.

Flexible high&#8208;voltage&#8208;tolerant COF SSE films with a holistically oriented channel structure, high ionic conductivity, and remarkable mechanical strength enabled the development of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811; see picture). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles as well as high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and mechanical foldability.







Abstract
By introducing lithiophilic groups and electrochemically stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkages, we prepared covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a large band gap with an ultralow HOMO value (&#8722;6.2&#8197;eV under vacuum) and oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (versus Li+/Li) as solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). The obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed a holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young's modulus of 10.5&#8197;GPa. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that lithium ions are transmitted in this COF SSE by directional hopping paths with fast drift velocity. The COF SSE film was used to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles, high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%), and could also withstand abuse tests, such as folding.

         <title>Dense Packing of Acetylene in a Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25068-25074, November 15, 2021. </description>

An ultra&#8208;microporous Al&#8208;MOF with suitable pore confinement enables the dense packing of C2H2 molecules for efficient C2H2/CO2 separation, exhibiting the benchmark balance between high separation performance, low cost, high stability, and large&#8208;scale synthesis for industrial applications.







Abstract
Porous materials for C2H2/CO2 separation mostly suffer from high regeneration energy, poor stability, or high cost that largely dampen their industrial implementation. A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost. We herein report a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H) for highly efficient C2H2/CO2 separation. The suitable pore confinement in CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H can not only provide multipoint binding interactions with C2H2 but also enable the dense packing of C2H2 inside the pores. This material exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage densities of 392&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 and highly selective adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 at ambient conditions, achieved by a low C2H2 adsorption enthalpy (27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, affording both large C2H2 uptake of 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high separation factor of 3.4. CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H achieves the benchmark balance between separation performance, stability, and cost for C2H2/CO2 separation.

         <title>A General Principle for DUV NLO Materials: &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Confinement Enlarges Band Gap**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25063-25067, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance DUV NLO materials whose band gaps are further enhanced. This principle is valid for all the DUV NLO materials known to date (the Chinese lunar year of the ox). Guided by this approach, the carbonophosphates are discovered for the first time as new DUV NLO candidates. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 exhibits the shortest SHG output laser among phosphates to date.







Abstract
Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7&#8197;eV wider than those of singular carbonates.

         <title>Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rational Design of a Multifunctional 3D Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Borax Layer</title>

A functional 3D cross&#8208;linked polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8208;borax layer possesses good electrolyte wettability, K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and structural stability, enabling a stable K plating and stripping process for more than 700&#8197;h of cycling without dendrite formation.







Abstract
K metal is the optimal anode for K&#8208;ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issues due to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium&#8208;metal batteries, a 3D polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8201;(PVA)&#8208;borax layer is designed, which enables a dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;plating/stripping process. The protective layer possesses good wettability, high K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;borax (PVA&#8208;borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25&#8201;% DOD and 50&#8201;% DOD, the PVA&#8208;borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180&#8197;h and 100&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Modulating Tri&#8208;Mode Emission for Single&#8208;Component White Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24984-24990, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of tri&#8208;mode afterglow is proposed to construct single&#8208;component white organic afterglow molecules by harvesting high&#8208;lying excitons on S1 and T1 for blue and low&#8208;lying excitons on T1* for yellow afterglow. After selectively modulating the intensity of yellow afterglow upon photoactivation, white organic afterglow with a lifetime up to 0.61&#8197;s and a quantum efficiency over 14&#8201;% was achieved.







Abstract
Achieving single&#8208;component white organic afterglow remains a great challenge owing to the difficulties in simultaneously supporting long&#8208;lived emissions from varied excited states of a molecule for complementary afterglow. Here, an extraordinary tri&#8208;mode emission from the radiative decays of singlet (S1), triplet (T1), and stabilized triplet (T1*) excited states was proposed to afford white afterglow through modulating the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) and exciton trapping depth (ETD). Low&#8208;lying T1* for yellow afterglow was constructed by H&#8208;aggregation engineering with large ETD and trace isomer doping, while high&#8208;lying T1 and S1 for blue afterglow with thermally activated emission feature were realized by reducing &#916;EST through donor&#8211;acceptor molecular design. Therefore, the single&#8208;component white afterglow with high efficiency of 14.1&#8201;% and a lifetime of 0.61&#8197;s was achieved by rationally regulating the afterglow intensity ratios of complementary emissions from S1, T1, and&#8197;T1*.

         <title>Impact of the Difluoromethylene Group in the Organocatalyzed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorohydrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24924-24929, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new interaction was discovered between C(sp3)F2 and an acylated chiral isothiourea, allowing an enantioselective recognition. This interaction was explored theoretically and experimentally in the kinetic resolution of racemic difluorohydrins, affording optically active organofluorines with a high level of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Due to the omnipresence of chiral organofluorine compounds in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material chemistry, the development of enantioselective methods for their preparation is highly desirable. In the present study, the enantioselective organocatalyzed acylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorohydrins using a commercially available chiral isothiourea is reported through a kinetic resolution (KR) process. It reveals that the difluoromethylene moiety (C(sp3)F2) can serve as a directing group through electrostatic fluorine&#8211;cation interactions, greatly improving the enantioselectivity of the KR. In this context, a broad range of fluorinated alcohols such as valuable 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols could be synthesized with exquisite enantiocontrol (typically &gt;99:1 er). Turning to 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, we also demonstrated that aromatic and fluorinated groups were mutually compatible to provide the expected enantioenriched adducts with &gt;99:1 er.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25128-25134, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. KYp self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation and leakage on the cell membrane. The peptide drugs internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide nanoparticle.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]2 (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), KYp can be dephosphorylated and self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation on cell membrane. Consequently, KYp internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide, and IC50 value of KYp is approximately 5 times lower than that of free peptide. Therefore, the in vivo self&#8208;assembly induced phase separation on cell membrane promises a new strategy to improve the drug delivery efficacy in cancer therapy.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow Metal Sulfides via Reverse Cation Exchange Reactions for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25055-25062, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted route inspired by the hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle was employed for successfully synthesizing a family of hollow metal sulfide (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS, CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1) via cation exchange reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a general Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted and reverse cation exchange&#8208;mediated growth strategy for fabricating hollow multinary metal sulfide. Unlike the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to give a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructures has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as&#8208;synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS), and quaternary compound (single&#8208;atom platinum anchored ZnxCd1&#8722;xS; ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductors obtained could significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Owing to the efficient charge transfer, the ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1 exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO, with the highest CO generation rate of 75.31&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;A Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S nanocube template-assisted route inspired by the hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle was employed for successfully synthesizing a family of hollow metal sulfide (CdS, ZnS, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, PbS, SnS, CuInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore a general Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S nanocube template-assisted and reverse cation exchange-mediated growth strategy for fabricating hollow multinary metal sulfide. Unlike the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri-n-butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to give a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructures has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as-synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S), and quaternary compound (single-atom platinum anchored Zn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S; Zn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductors obtained could significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced, Self&#8208;Traced Nanomotors on the Surface of Silicon</title>

Gold&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;based motors moving on the silicon surface are demonstrated. Their movement leaves a trace engraved on the silicon surface, representing an exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. Their velocity can be greatly enhanced by the plasmon resonance. Moreover, the traces generated by the movement of gold nanosphere dimers and trimers also provide a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale silicon patterns.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon&#8208;enhanced Au nanocrystal&#8208;based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24941-24949, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;vinyloxiranes with the challenging nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters) was achieved. It was successfully applied to the stereodivergent synthesis of structurally rigid spirocyclic framework. A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner.







Abstract
The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.

A novel protein nanocage has been developed capable of on&#8208;demand reversible disassembly via simple buffer exchanges under mild conditions. Data presented herein also show the nanocage is capable of in vivo and in vitro cargo loading, suggesting a broad range of possible applications in biocatalysis, bionanotechnology, and biomedicine. Additional findings include structure determination and protein design verification via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy.







Abstract
Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.

         <title>Cathodic Electrodeposition of MOF Films Using Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24950-24957, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films were made by cathodic electrodeposition using hydrogen peroxide as a pro&#8208;base whose single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials thus preventing the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extending the range of possible metal nodes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be made by cathodic electrodeposition, where a Br&#248;nsted base is formed electrochemically which deprotonates the MOF linkers that are present in solution as undissociated/partially dissociated weak acids. However, the co&#8208;deposition of metal and the narrow range of possible metal nodes limit the scope of this method. In this work, we propose the use of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide assisted cathodic deposition or HPACD), to overcome these limitations. Electrochemical measurements indicate that in DMF, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to superoxide anions that deprotonate the carboxylic ligands. This single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials than all previous reported methods. This prevents the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extends the range of possible metal nodes. Various pure MOF films (HKUST&#8208;1, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) and MOF&#8208;5) were prepared via this approach. HPACD was also used for the preparation of patterned MOF films and of flexible Cu&#8208;BTC coated paper membranes which reject 99.1&#8201;% of Rose Bengal from water with a permeance of 8.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1.

         <title>Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N&#8208;Methylmaleimide**

The cycloaddition of tropolone with maleimide in the presence of weak base involves an ambimodal transition state that leads directly to both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N&#8208;methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N&#8208;methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo&#8208;adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo&#8208;adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo&#8208;product, which is thermodynamically more stable.

         <title>Stable Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Droplet Dynamics through a Buffer Strategy with a Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Sensitive Fluorogenic Probe</title>

We report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by using structure illumination microscopy. LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG with fresh probe molecules from outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized.







Abstract
Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better&#8208;performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG by intact probe molecules outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Using this probe, two LD coalescence modes were discovered. The dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation, i.e., a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of LD&#8208;FG makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium Ions Enables Collective Total Syntheses of Indole Alkaloids</title>

Catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions was developed for the versatile synthesis of enantiomerically enriched C1&#8208;alkynyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines, the utility of which was demonstrated by concise collective total syntheses of the seven indole alkaloids harmicine, geissoschizol, geissoschizine, akuammicine, desethyleburnamonine, eburnamonine, and larutensine within 10 steps (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.

         <title>A Phase Inversion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Fabrication of Helical Microfibers towards Versatile Artificial Abdominal Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25089-25096, November 15, 2021. </description>

A novel phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) technology is developed to continuously produce stretchable high&#8208;strength polycaprolactone (PCL) helical microfibers with controllable structures. The helical microfibers are weaved into strong, bi&#8208;oriented stretchable, flexible and biocompatible artificial skins meshes, which can be used to prevent abdominal incisional hernia formation and promote wound healing.







Abstract
Microfluidic spinning technology (MST), incorporating microfluidics with chemical reactions, has gained considerable interest for constructing anisotropic advanced microfibers, especially helical microfibers. However, these efforts suffer from the limited material choices, restricting their applications. Here, a new phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) method is proposed for producing helical microfibers. This method undergoes a physicochemical phase inversion process, which is capable of efficiently manufacturing strong (tensile stress of more than 25&#8197;MPa), stretchable, flexible and biocompatible helical microfibers. The helical microfibers can be used to fabricate bi&#8208;oriented stretchable artificial abdominal skin, preventing incisional hernia formation and promoting the wound healing without conglutination. This research not only offers a universal approach to design helical microfibers but also provides a new insight into artificial skin.

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25042-25047, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; formed in a reaction of (Sn2Sb2)2&#8722; with [AuMePPh3] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free&#8208;standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.







Abstract
The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#8901;py (1; crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions.

&lt;p&gt;[Sb(AuMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formed in a reaction of (Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with [AuMePPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free-standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anion of [K(crypt-222)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Sb(AuMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;py (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; crypt-222=4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p-block metal atom being surrounded by four free-standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side-products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Three synthetic routes to the completely unsubstituted corrole are described. This allows for full characterization of five metal complexes chelated by this corrole, which were used to uncover unique beneficial features that are relevant to clean energy catalysis and many other purposes.







Abstract
Corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly cross new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We have obtained the substituent&#8208;free corrole by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.

         <title>Tailored Chiral Copper Selenide Nanochannels for Ultrasensitive Enantioselective Recognition and Detection</title>

A chiral penicillamine&#8208;modified Cu2&#8722;xSe/AAO heterostructure membrane nanochannel was fabricated for the enantioselective detection of naproxen based on an electrochemical system.







Abstract
We constructed a tailorable membrane channel system consisting of penicillamine molecules intercalated in copper selenide nanoparticles (Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs), which exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the near infrared region (CD, 800&#8211;1600&#8197;nm) with a maximum intensity of 164.5&#8197;mdeg at 1440&#8197;nm. The chiral ligand hybridized to the surface of achiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs by breaking the intrinsic symmetry of Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs and further large&#8208;scale assembly induced strong optical activity. The fabricated multilayer chiral membrane achieved an increased rectification ratio (RR) up to 114. The integration of penicillamine allowed for high enantioselective recognition against naproxen,which displayed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.027&#8197;nM.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25075-25081, November 15, 2021. </description>

A stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of custom&#8208;built A, B, and C building blocks gives ABC baskets. Such enantioselective and modular construction allows choosing depth and shape of the cavitand's nonpolar pocket while also selecting desired functional groups at the rim. Building more effective mimics of biological receptors and catalysts is within reach.







Abstract
The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprised of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched A (borochloronorbornene), B (iodobromonorbornene), and C (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive A&#8208;to&#8208;B and then AB&#8208;to&#8208;C Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched ABC cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a)&#8197;an enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either tBu, Et, or Me esters, (b)&#8197;both enantiomers of a so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space, and (c)&#8197;a photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.

A supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is established using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and dye molecules. Tunable and customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) is achieved on inorganic, organic, and biological particles, with potential applications in the physical and life sciences.







Abstract
The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dyes. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5&#8197;min) produces ultrathin coatings (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH values from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences.

         <title>Effect of Surfactants on the Molecular Structure of the Buried Oil/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25143-25150, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increased ordering of oil molecules' aliphatic chains and the enhanced alignment of water molecules at the oil/water interface was revealed upon increasing adsorption of anionic surfactant using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. The surfactant coverage inducing the highest&#8208;ordered oil molecule configuration at the interface matches a significant reduction of interfacial tension and high emulsion stability.







Abstract
The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration owing to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bridged Methylnaphthyl Palladium Dimers as Versatile Catalyst Precursors in Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25151-25160, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide&#8208;bridged 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl palladium dimers are presented as convenient, yet highly efficient palladium sources for cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The bench&#8208;stable complexes smoothly react with various ligands yielding monoligated palladium precatalysts. These display record&#8208;setting activity in various catalytic reactions, clearly beyond that achievable by ligand screening alone.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium dimers are presented as multipurpose Pd&#8208;precursors, ideally suited for catalytic method development and preparative organic synthesis. By simply mixing with phosphine or carbene ligands, they are in situ converted into well&#8208;defined monoligated complexes. Their catalytic performance was benchmarked against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems in challenging Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, Heck, Suzuki and Negishi couplings, and ketone arylations. Their use enabled record&#8208;setting activities, beyond those achievable by optimization of the ligand alone. The MeNAP catalysts permit syntheses of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted arenes and bulky anilines in near&#8208;quantitative yields at room temperature, allow mono&#8208;arylations of small ketones, and enable so far elusive cross&#8208;couplings of secondary alkyl boronic acids with aryl chlorides.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones Bearing Two Vicinal Stereocenters Enabled by Synergistic Copper and Iridium Catalysis</title>

An unprecedented asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization between racemic aldimine esters and racemic vinylethylene carbonate catalyzed by synergistic Cu/Ir catalysis is presented. The metalated azomethine ylide acts as a two&#8208;atom unit and opens up access to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereogenic centers in a stereodivergent manner.







Abstract
By virtue of a fundamentally new reaction model of azomethine ylide serving as a two&#8208;atom synthon, we present the first example of stereodivergent preparation of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via synergistic Cu/Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization, and all four stereoisomers of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereocenters are accessible with excellent diastereoselective and enantioselective control. The chiral IrIII&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate was separated and characterized to understand the origin of the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the initial C&#8722;C bond formation process. Control experiments shed some light on the catalyst/substrate and catalyst/catalyst interactions in this dual catalytic system to rationalize the related kinetic/dynamic kinetic resolution process with different catalyst combinations. The enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products were converted into an array of structurally complex chiral molecules and organocatalysts that were otherwise inaccessible.

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle Refinement</title>

Refinement of FeP nanoparticles can result in a gradual increase in the graphitization degree and interface magnetization. Furthermore, it provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity during cycling.







Abstract
We present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D carbon framework (FeP@NC). Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, a sodium&#8208;ion battery with the FeP@NC composite exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 82.0&#8201;% in 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. Also, particle refinement leads to a capacity increase during cycling. The FeP nanoparticles go through a refining&#8211;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling. The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

This article demonstrates a novel synthetic strategy that can be used to tune the interstrand distance between conjugated polymers with unprecedented precision. This control provides an ideal platform for fundamental insight into the solid&#8208;state optical properties of NDI polymers.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are an important class of chromophores for optoelectronic devices. Understanding and controlling their excited state properties, in particular, radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes are among the greatest challenges that must be overcome. We report the synthesis and characterization of a molecularly encapsulated naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer, one of the most successfully used motifs, and explore its structural and optical properties. The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect of interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non&#8208;encapsulated analogue P(NDI&#8208;2OD&#8208;T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing &#960;&#8208;interchain stacking distance. This suggests that decreasing &#960;&#8208;stacking distances may be an attractive method to enhance the radiative properties of conjugated polymers in contrast to the current paradigm where it is viewed as a source of optical quenching.

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Tunable energy transfer with designable direction, from second linkers to pristine MOFs or from pristine MOFs to second linkers, was achieved in the whole visible spectrum via installing color&#8208;full emissive second linkers into the full&#8208;color emissive pristine MOFs.







Abstract
While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr6 cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for linker installation. Six full&#8208;color emissive 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L, in which the ET can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via ET in LMOFs.

         <title>A Systematic Study of the Effects of Complex Structure on Aryl Iodide Oxidative Addition at Bipyridyl&#8208;Ligated Gold(I) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24976-24983, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assessment of the effects of complex structure on the oxidative addition mechanism of aryl iodides at bipyridyl&#8208;ligated AuI&#8208;centers is described. It is shown that the hemilability of the bipy ligand and the electropositivity of the Au&#8208;center are important factors, leading to facile oxidative addition with electron&#8208;poor ligands and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides. These unusual observations contrast established Pd&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to study the unusual mechanism of oxidative addition of aryl iodides to [bipyAu(C2H4)]+ complexes. The modular nature of this system allowed a systematic assessment of the effects of complex structure. Computational comparisons between cationic gold and the isolobal (neutral) Pd0 and Pt0 complexes revealed similar mechanistic features, but with oxidative addition being significantly favored for the group&#8197;10 metals. Further differences between Au and Pd were seen in experimental studies: studying reaction rates as a function of electronic and steric properties showed that ligands bearing more electron&#8208;poor functionality increase the rate of oxidative addition; in a complementary way, electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides give faster rates. This divergence in mechanism compared to Pd suggests that Ar&#8722;X oxidative addition with Au can underpin a broad range of new or complementary transformations.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Aromaticity Relief as an Approach to Stabilize Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 25082-25088, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radicals substituted with anti&#8208;aromatic rings have greater stability than radicals with aromatic substituents as a result of a new stereoelectronic stabilization approach driven by anti&#8208;aromaticity relief.







Abstract
A new strategy to stabilize free radicals electronically is described by conjugating formally antiaromatic substituents to the free radical. With an antiaromatic substituent, the radical acts as an electron sink to allow configuration mixing of a low&#8208;energy zwitterionic state that provides antiaromaticity relief to the substituent. A combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, VT&#8208;EPR and VT&#8208;UV/Vis spectroscopy, as well as computational analysis, was used to investigate this phenomenon. We find that this strategy of antiaromaticity relief is successful at stabilizing radicals, but only if the antiaromatic substituent is constrained to be planar by synthetically imposed conformational restraints that enable state mixing. This work leads to the counterintuitive finding that increasing the antiaromaticity of the radical substituent leads to greater radical stability, providing proof of concept for a new stereoelectronic approach for stabilizing free radicals.

A hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) integrated with MoS2 nanosheets is fabricated in the Communication on page&#8197;24849 by Xu Jing, Chunying Duan et&#8197;al. The composite is effective for the photocatalytic conversion of gas&#8208;phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2 under visible light irradiation. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interface between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2 play a key role in achieving high selectivity for C2 production.

Topochemical reactions are lattice&#8208;controlled reactions that occur in crystals or other confined media. However, only a handful of topochemical reactions are known so far. In their Communication on page&#8197;24875, Ravichandran Khazeber and Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan report a new topochemical reaction: a topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction, in which a proximally placed azide and an alkene undergo a cycloaddition reaction to form triazoline in a regiospecific, stereospecific, and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion.

Massarinolin A and the purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes containing a complex tetracyclic skeleton. In their Communication on page&#8197;24828, Mingji Dai and co&#8208;workers report a divergent and enantioselective approach to complete the first total syntheses of five tetracyclic bergamotane sesquiterpenes, which also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. Their approach features a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the challenging bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane core and a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone moiety.

Secondary alcohols , which follow either an E1 or an E2 elimination pathway, were investigated by Eszter Bar&#225;th, Johannes&#8197;A. Lercher, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;24806. It is known that water forms clusters within the zeolite channels; however, its effect on the intrinsic mechanism of the dehydration needs to be fundamentally understood. It was found that the volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint. The individual TOFs depend on the substrate&#8208;related mechanism.

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24754-24769, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the known chemistry for the preparation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives reported up to mid&#8208;2021. Bridge substitution on BCP derivatives often provides patent&#8208;free, novel vectors for substituent disposition in drug discovery and materials science; this capacity may prove to be transformational in the coming years.







Abstract
&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.

The membrane in redox flow batteries (RFBs) plays a critical role in their practical application. Promising RFB membranes require the deliberate design of their materials chemistry and microstructure. This Review highlights the design rationales of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level with in&#8208;depth discussion of the structure&#8211;property relationships, and subsequently discusses future prospect in the field.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are among the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability, and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion&#8208;conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly. Specific systems must meet additional requirements, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this Review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on new chemistry, novel microstructures, and innovative fabrication strategies. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.

The first total syntheses of complex bergamotane sesquiterpenes massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C were achieved with key steps involving an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement, a furan oxidative cyclization, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation and sigmatropic elimination. Our synthesis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A.







Abstract
Massarinolin&#8197;A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxaspiro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the exo methylene group of massarinolin&#8197;A.

         <title>Cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide as a Building Block for P,C,N Conjugated Molecules</title>

Na[PCO] reacts with Ph3ECl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) and Na[N(SiMe3)2] to form the series of anions [Ph3E&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722;. The silylated anion forms PCN heteroallenes in reactions with tetrel chlorides and binds via nitrogen to triphenylborane. P&#8208;nucleophilicity and lability of the silyl substituent in [Ph3Si&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722; are evidenced in reactions with isocyanates and carbodiimides, which afford phosphorus analogues of cyanourea and 2&#8208;cyanoguanidine.







Abstract
The cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide anion was prepared as a sodium salt from 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. The electronic structure of this new cyano(silyl)phosphanide was studied via computational methods and its reactivity investigated using various electrophiles and Lewis acids, demonstrating its P&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilicity. The ambident reactivity is in agreement with computations. The silyl group also shows lability and therefore the cyano(silyl)phosphanide can be considered as a phosphacyanamide synthon, [PCN]2&#8722;, and serves as building block for the transfer of a PCN moiety.

The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24849-24853, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allow photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

&lt;p&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO-66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nodes to form Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allow photo-catalytic conversion of gas phase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO-66 (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-UiO-66) to form Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO-66 and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo-generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-UiO-66/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite facilitates the photo-catalytic conversion of gas phase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge-polarized Zr-O-Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organophosphine&#8208;Sandwiched Copper Iodide Cluster Enables Charge Trapping</title>

Molecular n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction based on biligand&#8208;sandwiched copper iodide nanocluster is constructed as charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories featuring large memory windows and energy&#8208;saving operation. Spatial electronic anisotropy of the lamellar structure and steric and insulating effects of phosphine ligands effectively hinder intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping as a basis of real single&#8208;molecule devices.







Abstract
Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction of biligand&#8208;sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy&#8208;saving operation. We found that the hole confinement on the p&#8208;type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n&#8208;type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon&#8208;phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual&#8208;ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping. Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement.

Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I are designed and synthesized successfully based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is the largest among the reported borates and phosphates.







Abstract
Exploring non &#960;&#8208;conjugated phosphate birefringent crystal with a large birefringence has been a great challenge. Herein, based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), two new compounds, Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I, were designed and synthesized successfully, maintaining the layer structural feature and enhancing the optical anisotropy of crystals. In particular, the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is larger than or equal to 0.664 @546&#8197;nm, which is largest among the reported borates and phosphates, even surpassing commercial birefringent crystals YVO4 and TiO2. This work indicates that a breakthrough in birefringence of inorganic compound was achieved. Also, it provides a guiding idea for exploring large birefringence materials in the future.

         <title>Biocatalytic, Intermolecular C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24864-24869, November 15, 2021. </description>

Directed evolution of P411 heme enzymes enables intermolecular C&#8722;H amidation with high yields and exquisite enantioselectivity. The biocatalytic process utilizes stable hydroxamate esters as nitrenoid precursors and is amenable to scaleup. Mechanistic studies reveal rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by a stepwise, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Directed evolution of heme proteins has opened access to new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic activity that can be harnessed to tackle synthetic challenges. Among these, reactions resulting from active site iron&#8208;nitrenoid intermediates present a powerful strategy to forge C&#8722;N bonds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic, intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation reaction operating at mild and scalable conditions. With hydroxamate esters as nitrene precursors, feedstock aromatic compounds can be converted to chiral amides with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). Kinetic and computational analysis of the enzymatic reaction reveals rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by stepwise hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.

Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid enables a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl iodides, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems.







Abstract
Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid has been identified to enable a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the coordinating orientation of the chiral amino acid to the arylpalladium(II) center allows for high levels of stereochemical control.

         <title>Influence of Intracrystalline Ionic Strength in MFI Zeolites on Aqueous Phase Dehydration of Methylcyclohexanols</title>

The volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint. The individual TOFs depend on the substrate related mechanism (E1 vs. E2).







Abstract
The impact of the concentration of hydrated hydronium ions and in turn of the local ionic strength in MFI zeolites has been investigated for the aqueous phase dehydration of 4&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E1 mechanism) and cis&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E2 mechanism). The E2 pathway with the latter alcohol led to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher activity. The catalytic activity normalized to the hydronium ions (turnover frequency, TOF) passed through a pronounced maximum, which is attributed to the increasing excess chemical potential of the alcohols in the pores, increasing in parallel with the ionic strength and the additional work caused by repulsive interactions and charge separation induced by the bulky alcohols. While the maximum in rate observed is invariant with the mechanism or substitution, the reaction pathway is influencing the activation parameters differently.

         <title>Nitrosobenzene&#8208;Enabled Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomeric N&#8208;Arylbenzimidazoles</title>

A benzimidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is presented. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Described herein is an imidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol. It is worth reflecting on the unique roles played by the nitroso group in this domino reaction. It functions as a linchpin by first offering an electrophilic site (N) for the initial C&#8722;N bond formation while the resulting amine performs the nucleophilic addition to form the second C&#8722;N bond. Additionally, it could facilitate the final oxidative aromatization as an oxidant. The atropisomeric products could be conveniently elaborated to a series of axially chiral derivatives, enabling the exploitation of N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles for their potential utilities in asymmetric catalysis.

Ion soft&#8208;landing was used to bind molecular fragment ions, generated in the gas phase, to molecular ions of same polarity by depositing them successively on surfaces. This can generate highly charged molecular ions which are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
While reactions between ions and neutral molecules in the gas phase have been studied extensively, reactions between molecular ions of same polarity remain relatively unexplored. Herein we show that reactions between fragment ions generated in the gas phase and molecular ions of the same polarity are possible by soft&#8208;landing of both reagents on surfaces. The reactive [B12I11]1&#8722; anion was deposited on a surface layer built up by landing the generally unreactive [B12I12]2&#8722;. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the generated material shows that [B24I23]3&#8722; was formed. A computational study shows that the product is metastable in the gas phase, but a charge&#8208;balanced environment of a grounded surface may stabilize the triply charged product, as suggested by model calculations. This opens new opportunities for the generation of highly charged clusters using unconventional building blocks from the gas phase.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Selective Deposition of Ultrathin Al2O3 on Copper Nanocrystals for Highly Stable CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24838-24843, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique was employed to selectively cover the (111) facets of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3, which significantly increases the faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 in both H&#8208;type and GDE flow cells. This Al2O3 overcoating also effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and aggregation of Cu NCs during CO2RR.







Abstract
Catalysts based on Cu nanocrystals (NCs) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion with high activity have been a subject of considerable interest, but poor stability and low selectivity for a single C2+ product remain obstacles for realizing sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral cycles. Here, we used the facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3 to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C) reaches a C2H4 faradaic efficiency of 60.4&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al2O3 overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C shown in stability tests.

A formal CH2&#8722;CH2 homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. Two single nucleophilic CH2 units are delivered to an isothiocyanate as competent electrophilic partner, resulting in the assembly of an imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds.







Abstract
A formal CH2&#8722;CH2 homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. The logic proposes the consecutive delivery of two single nucleophilic CH2 units to an isothiocyanate&#8212;as competent electrophilic partner&#8212;resulting in the assembling of a rare imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The single synthetic operation procedure documents genuine chemocontrol, as indicated by the tolerance to various reactive elements decorating the starting materials. Significantly, the double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, thus not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds (e.g. boron).

The single synthetic operation procedure documents genuine chemocontrol, as indicated by the tolerance to various reactive elements decorating the starting materials. Significantly, the double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, thus not requiring the installation of heteroatom-centered manifolds (e.g. boron).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24882-24887, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the urgent need to produce high grade sodium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Our synthesis involves the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate to sodium metal under anhydrous conditions, which prevents the formation of NaF and other commonly found hydrolysis products seen in commercial samples. The high purity allows for up to 3&#8197;M electrolyte concentrations to be achieved.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF6 in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3&#8197;M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8208;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2&#8197;M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1&#8197;M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.

Enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are developed to enable cascade depolymerization triggered by metathesis catalysts. Stable in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, and at elevated temperatures, these enyne SIPs can undergo efficient depolymerization in response to external stimuli. This work established a general approach to stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled release of heterocyclic reagents.







Abstract
A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic Acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24811-24816, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes used to metabolically label legionaminic acid on bacterial flagella substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative legionaminyl transferase in Campylobacter jejuni (see picture). The labeled glycan could be detected intracellularly as its activated CMP analogue, on flagella by Western blot analysis, and on intact bacteria by confocal microscopy.







Abstract
Campylobacter jejuni is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily O&#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Herein, we report the development of a metabolic labeling method for Leg glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labeled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on C.&#8197;jejuni and its isogenic maf4 mutant we also further substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. Further evidence was provided by UPLC&#8211;MS detection of labeled CMP&#8208;Leg and an in silico model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in C.&#8197;jejuni motility and invasiveness.

Bound then free: DNA nanoflowers are used to immobilize a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#8208;modified DNA strand (hCG&#8208;DNA), which can be released by DNA amplicons from loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) via toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and detected with an off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf pregnancy test strip (PTS) in a separation&#8208;free one&#8208;step process. The method is capable of achieving single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious human diseases. Herein, we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strips (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2&#8197;copies&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24859-24863, November 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridecasaccharide glycan domain of lipooligosaccharides from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii was synthesized. The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base&#8208;sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.







Abstract
The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.

The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base-sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium kansasii&lt;/i&gt;. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The photodegradation pathway of acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini for organic photovoltaics was elucidated as a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift (see picture). This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we elucidate the photodegradation pathway of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. Using IT&#8208;4F as a benchmark example, we isolated the photoproducts and proved them isomers of IT&#8208;4F formed by a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift. This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction path (quenchable by oxygen). Adding controlled amounts of the photoproduct P1 to PM6:IT&#8208;4F bulk heterojunction cells led to a progressive decrease in photocurrent and fill factor attributed to its poor absorption and charge transport properties. The reaction is a general photodegradation pathway for a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini, and its rate varies with the structure of the donor and acceptor moiety.

         <title>Molten Salt Electrochemical Modulation of Iron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen consisting of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with highly grafted Fe3C nanoparticles is an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries owing to the facilitated adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides.







Abstract
Sulfur hosts with rationally designed chemistry to confine and convert lithium polysulfides are of prime importance for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A molten salt electrochemical modulation of iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen is herein demonstrated as formation of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with grafted Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C@Fe3C), which is rationalized as an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Fe3C over nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon contributes to enhanced adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur&#8208;loaded Fe3C@C@Fe3C electrodes hence show a high capacity, good cyclic stability, and enhanced rate performance. This work highlights the unique chemistry of metal carbides on facilitating adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides, and also extends the scope of molten salt electrolysis to elaboration of energy materials.

         <title>Desolvation of Peptide Bond by O to S Substitution Impacts Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 47, Page 24870-24874, November 15, 2021. </description>

A C=O to C=S substitution in the amide bond dramatically alters the water structure around the thioamide bond, ultimately reducing the microenvironment polarity. The increased hydrophobicity of the modified peptide bond is utilized to amplify the thermostability of proteins by this single atom substitution.







Abstract
Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14&#8201;&#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.

         <title>On&#8208;DNA Transfer Hydrogenolysis and Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) are an increasingly popular approach to finding small molecule ligands for proteins. Many DEL synthesis protocols hinge on sequential additions of monomers using split&#8208;pool combinatorial methods. Therefore, compatible protecting group strategies that allow the unmasking of reactive functionality (e.g. amines and alcohols) prior to monomer coupling, or the removal of less desirable functionality (e.g. alkenes and alkynes) are highly desirable. Hydrogenation / hydrogenolysis procedures would achieve these ends but has not been amenable to DEL chemistry. We report a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using Pd / C, HCONH  4  and the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, which gives highly efficient conversions for hydrogenolysis of Cbz&#8208;protected amines and benzyl protected alcohols and hydrogenation of nitros, halides, nitriles, aldehydes, alkenes and alkynes. Application to multicycle synthesis of an encoded compound was fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis. This method will enable synthetic DEL sequences using orthogonal protecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the n &#8594;&#960; * Interaction in Alkene Isomerisation by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the design of geometric alkene isomerisation protocols,  Nature  continues to be a valuable source of reaction blueprints. These exemplars of efficiency are often limited to the net  exergonic  direction (DG&#176;&lt;0), with the antipodal net  endergonic  processes (DG&#176;&gt;0) being comparatively under&#8208;represented in the biochemical repertoire. Inspired by the expansiveness of the maleate to fumarate (  Z  &#8594;  E  ) isomerisation in biochemistry, the inverse  E  &#8594;  Z  variant has been investigated to validate n  O  &#8594;&#960;  C=  O  * interactions as a driving force for  contra  &#8208;thermodynamic isomerisation. A general protocol is disclosed under the auspices of selective energy transfer catalysis using inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer (&#955;  max  = 402 nm). Whilst in the enzymatic process n  O  &#8594;&#960;  C=  O  * interactions commonly manifest themselves in the substrate, these same interactions are shown to underpin directionality in the antipodal reaction by shortening the product alkene chromophore. The process is validated with diverse fumarate derivatives, including the first examples of tetrasubstituted alkenes (&gt;30 examples, up to  Z:E  &gt;99:1), and the involvement of n  O  &#8594;&#960;  C=  O  * interactions is validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expanded 2D Fused Aromatic Network with 90&#8208;Ring Hexagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic networks (2D FANs) have emerged as a highly versatile alternative to holey graphene. The synthesis of 2D FANs with increasingly larger lattice dimensions will enable new application perspectives. However, the synthesis of larger analogs is mostly limited by lack of appropriate monomers and methods.&#160;Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterisation and properties of an expanded 2D FAN&#160;with 90&#8208;ring hexagons,&#160;which exceed the largest 2D FAN lattices reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylcarbocyclization of Alkynes Using SEt as a Traceless Directing Group: Access to Cyclopentenes and Indenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentenes and indenes are important structural scaffolds in synthetic, medical, and material chemistry. Cyclization of alkynes via remote C&#8208;H functionalization is an appealing approach to construct these motifs due to its high efficiency and step&#8208;economy. Herein, a traceless directing group strategy was designed to reverse the regioselectivity of radical addition which enabled an unprecedented photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes by forming C&#8208;C bond on inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bond. It offers a facile access to decorated cyclopentenes and indenes under mild conditions. The resultant products could be converted into a set of valuable molecular scaffolds, including a key intermediate of AM&#8208;6226. Mechanistic experiments suggest a radical cascade pathway comprising a Markovnikov&#8208;type sulfonylation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, and &#946;&#8208;elimination. This study lays further groundwork for the use of anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization in rapidly assembling five&#8208;membered carbocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Manipulating Space&#8208;resolved Persistent Luminescence in Core&#8208;shell MOFs Heterostructures via Reversible Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, photo&#8208;controllable persistent luminescence at the single crystal level can be achieved by the integration of long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and photochromism within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for the first time. Moreover, the multiblock core&#8211;shell heterojunctions have been prepared utilizing the isostructural MOFs through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits bright yellow afterglow emission that gradually disappears upon further irradiation, but the core does not show such property. Benefitting from combined persistent luminescence and photochromic behavior, a multiple encryption demo can be facilely designed based on the dynamic manipulating RTP via reversible photochromism. Therefore, this work not only develops new types of dynamically photo&#8208;controllable afterglow switch, but also provides a method to obtain MOFs&#8208;based optical heterojunctions towards potential space/time&#8208;resolved information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as a Multiphoton Excitation Regulator for the Activation of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and oxidization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into value&#8208;added chemicals affords attractively economic and ecological benefits as well as central challenge in modern chemistry. Inspired by the natural enzymatic transformation, herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach to activate the inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen by integrating the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) events together into one metal&#8211;organic framework. The well&#8208;modified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) mimics oxidized CeIII&#8722;OEt moieties to generate CeIV&#8722;OEt chromophore and its reduced state mimics NAD&#8226; via PET. The in situ formed CeIV&#8722;OEt moiety triggers a LMCT excitation to form the alkoxy radical EtO&#8226;, abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, accompanying the recovery of CeIII&#8722;OEt and the formation of alkyl radicals. The formed NAD&#8226; activates oxygen to regenerate the NAD+ for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid synthesis of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and exploration of the polymerization mechanism are highly desired for the research of crystalline porous polymers, but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy to successfully prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs within 20 minutes for the first time. By in&#8208;situ imaging and time&#8208;dependent characterization, we proposed an ordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization mechanism for crystalline CTFs, in which the monomers rapidly polymerize into periodic 2D molecular sheets within 10 s and then grow into more ordered framework structures. Photocatalytic study of CTF with different crystallinity revealed that large crystalline domain could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, single&#8208;layer and few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets could be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit nearly fivefold improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate up to 7971 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is superior to most reported polymeric photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically&#8208;linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8211;Pd II intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. The transformation was scalable up to 1 mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn &#8208; carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by Pd II &#8208; catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of Pd(II) which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd(0) species. Once generated, Pd(0) triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalysed Asymmetric Addition and Alkylation of Secondary Phosphine Oxides for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordination group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides. A series of tertiary phosphine oxides were generated with up to 99% yield and 99.5% ee with wide functional group tolerances. Mechanistic studies reveal that (R)&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides preferentially interact with the cobalt catalysts to produce P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Non&#8208;Natural Photoenzyme for Improved Photon Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials to products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent 'ene&#8217;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. Here, we describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#120574; , &#120575; , &#120576; &#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies indicate that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes &#8211; indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism. Overall, this platform enables the development and optimization of photoenzymes for tailored applications in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Light&#8208;Activatable tRNA Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis methods using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond&#8208;breaking is an essential process in natural and synthetic chemical transformations. Accordingly, the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control, as historically evidenced in fields such as organic synthesis. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond&#8208;breaking to reticular materials, in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct, three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3&#8208;D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from a metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus, to the design and synthesis of countless new molecules and materials.</dc:description>
