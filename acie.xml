         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8208;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with  s  &#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst design consisting of the double&#8208;decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra&#8208;stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600&#8201;&#176;C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1&#8197;month.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#8201;&#176;C (kd=0.00033&#8197;h&#8722;1, &#964;=3067&#8197;h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1&#8197;month for the first time.

         <title>Maximizing the Catalytic Performance of Pd@AuxPd1&#8722;x Nanocubes in H2O2 Production by Reducing Shell Thickness to Increase Compositional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We address the issue of surface segregation of alloy electrocatalysts by conformally depositing the alloy as an ultrathin shell on shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals. As a result of the optimized Au/Pd ratio in the shell and highly active {100} facets, we obtain Pd@Au0.95Pd0.05 nanocubes with superb performance in electrochemical H2O2 production.







Abstract
We report a simple route based upon seed&#8208;mediated growth to the synthesis of Pd@AuxPd1&#8722;x (0.8&#8804;x&#8804;1) core&#8211;shell nanocubes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined {100} facets and an optimal Au/Pd ratio for the surface, the nanocubes bearing a shell made of Au0.95Pd0.05 work as an efficient electrocatalyst toward H2O2 production, with high selectivity of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in the low&#8208;overpotential region of 0.4&#8211;0.7&#8197;V. When the Au0.95Pd0.05 alloy is confined to a shell of only three atomic layers in thickness, the electrocatalyst is able to maintain its surface structure and elemental composition, endowing continuous and stable production of H2O2 during oxygen reduction at a high rate of 1.62&#8197;mol&#8201;g(Pd+Au)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a versatile route to the rational development of active and durable electrocatalysts based upon alloy nanocrystals.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Programming of Supramolecular Assemblies in Living Cells for Selective Cancer Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integration of the endocytotic process and the overexpressing enzyme within lysosome in cancer cells, we construct enzymatic programmable assemblies selectively in living cancer cells for glioblastoma cancer therapy.







Abstract
Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving Deoxyribozymes Differentiate Methylated Cytidine Isomers in RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro selected deoxyribozymes respond to the presence of methylcytidines m3C, m4C and m5C in RNA with either enhanced or strongly diminished cleavage rates, and thereby directly reveal the presence of the modified cytidines in target RNA.







Abstract
Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxyribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxyribozymes are programmable for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Derived Molecular Isolation Layer for Highly Stable Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar molecular cobalt phthalocyanine was introduced into the bare electrolyte of a Li|LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell under lean electrolyte conditions (3&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1), thereby protecting the cathode and anode electrodes at the same time, and enhancing the electrochemical performance. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure was used to verify the protective mechanism of additives at the cathode and anode electrodes.







Abstract
The uneven consumption of anions during the lithium (Li) deposition process triggers a space charge effect that generates Li dendrites, seriously hindering the practical application of Li&#8208;metal batteries. We report on a cobalt phthalocyanine electrolyte additive with a planar molecular structure, which can be tightly adsorbed on the Li anode surface to form a dense molecular layer. Such a planar molecular layer cannot only complex with Li ions to reduce the space charge effect, but also suppress side reactions between the anode and the electrolyte, producing a stable solid electrolyte interphase composed of amorphous lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium carbonate (LiCO3), as verified by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy. As a result, the Li|Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability above 700&#8197;h under a high plating capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the assembled Li|lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) full&#8208;cell can also deliver excellent cycling over 200&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (3&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>A Dynamic Chemical Clip in Supramolecular Framework for Sorting Alkylaromatic Isomers using Thermodynamic and Kinetic Preferences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic adsorbent that acts like a chemical clip was realized, which sorts alkylaromatic isomers with high selectivity. The design of the chemical clip is based on a supramolecular coordination polymer, and the thermodynamic and kinetic preferences towards the isomers are unveiled by a combinatorial experimental and computational approach.







Abstract
Adsorptive chemical separation is at the forefront of future technologies, for use in chemical and petrochemical industries. In this process, a porous adsorbent selectively allows a single component from a mixture of three or more chemical components to be adsorbed or permeate. To separate the unsorted chemicals, a different adsorbent is needed. A unique adsorbent which can recognize and separate each of the chemicals from a mixture of three or more components is the necessity for the next generation porous materials. In this regard, we demonstrate a &#8220;dynamic chemical clip&#8221; in a supramolecular framework capable of thermodynamic and kinetics&#8208;based chemical separation. The dynamic space, featuring a strong preference for aromatic guests through &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and adaptability, can recognize the individual chemical isomers from mixtures and separate those based on thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The liquid&#8208;phase selectivity and separation of the aromatic isomers are possible by the adaptability of the &#8220;chemical clip&#8221; and here we elucidate the prime factors in a combinatorial approach involving crystallographic evidence and detailed computational studies.

         <title>Covalently Aligned Molybdenum Disulfide&#8211;Carbon Nanotubes Heteroarchitecture for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroarchitecture of MoS2&#8208;CNTs was developed in which CNTs are vertically anchored within MoS2 by a C&#8722;Mo covalent bond. Due to the high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels, and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs show high energy density and large capacitance, which can power wearable health&#8208;monitoring devices efficiently.







Abstract
Advanced two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets that promote the dynamic transportation and storage capacity of ions are significant for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, such materials often possess a low energy density. We have developed an ordered heteroarchitecture of molybdenum disulfide&#8208;carbon nanotubes (MoS2&#8208;CNTs) in which CNTs are vertically grafted within a MoS2 framework by C&#8722;Mo covalent bonds. Benefiting from this in&#8197;situ vertical bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS2&#8208;CNTs presents ultralarge capacitance (5485&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and good structural stability in potassium hydroxide electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs obtained through direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226&#8197;mWh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good capacitance (723&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable high/low&#8208;temperature operating ability, which can power a wearable health&#8208;monitoring device.

         <title>Aggregation Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Palladium and Nickel Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization   and Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we install an azobenzene functionality in olefin polymerization catalysts and use light to modulate their properties via photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerization of the azobenzene moiety. The initially targeted azobenzene&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium and nickel catalysts are not photoresponsive. To address this issue, an imine&#8208;amine system bearing interrupted conjugation with the metal center, and a sandwich&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diimine system bearing an azobenzene unit at a position covalently far from the metal center were prepared and studied. We demonstrate that light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties. More interestingly, the light&#8208;mediated property changes were attributed to ligand electronic effects in one system and ligand steric effects in the other.</dc:description>

A new method to achieve synthetic melanin materials with various well&#8208;defined architectures, ranging from spheres to anisotropic sheets and ellipsoidal platelets, is described. The specific shapes are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the building blocks of melanins, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to render polymeric materials without changing the overall morphology.







Abstract
Melanosomes in nature have diverse morphologies, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization&#8208;Induced Nanoassemblies for Self&#8208;Augmented Cascade Chemotherapy and Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumor</title>

We reported a one&#8208;pot supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach to fabricate H2O2&#8208;responsive nanomedicine with highly controllable drug loading and rapid clearance for self&#8208;augmented synergistic chemo/chemodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of chemodynamic therapy is impeded by the insufficient intracellular H2O2 level in tumor tissues. Herein, we developed a supramolecular nanoparticle via a simple one&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly process using platinum (IV) complex&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;ferrocene conjugates as supramolecular monomers. The supramolecular nanoparticles could dissociate rapidly upon exposure to endogenous H2O2 in the tumor and release hydroxyl radicals as well as platinum (IV) prodrugs in situ, which is reduced into cisplatin to significantly promote the generation of H2O2 in the tumor tissue. Thus, the supramolecular nanomedicine overcomes the limitation of conventional chemodynamic therapy via the self&#8208;augmented cascade radical generation and drug release. In addition, dissociated supramolecular nanoparticles could be readily excreted from the body via renal clearance to effectively avoid systemic toxicity and ensure long term biocompatibility of the nanomedicine. This work may provide new insights on the design and development of novel supramolecular nanoassemblies for cascade chemo/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Has Anti&#8208;Proliferative Activity in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17514-17521, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is challenging, as it is involved in diseases via protein&#8208;protein interactions. Here, the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC MD13 is reported, which eliminates MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network by inducing MIF degradation. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells by reducing MIF protein levels and MIF&#8208;related signaling, demonstrating the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in protein&#8208;protein interactions that play key roles in inflammation and cancer. Current strategies to develop small molecule modulators of MIF functions are mainly restricted to the MIF tautomerase active site. Here, we use this site to develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) in order to eliminate MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network. We report the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted MD13, which induced almost complete MIF degradation at low micromolar concentrations with a DC50 around 100&#8197;nM in A549 cells. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells, which can be explained by deactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. MD13 also exhibits antiproliferative effect in a 3D tumor spheroid model. In conclusion, we describe the first MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC (MD13) as a research tool, which also demonstrates the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17654-17663, August 2, 2021. </description>

We demonstrate that Scholl reaction of a bis&#8208;perylene precursor gave either a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or a negatively curved PAH embedded with octagons, which can be explained by a radical cation or an arenium ion mechanism under different reaction conditions. The formed molecules show non&#8208;aggregative features and exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields.







Abstract
A planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (2) was synthesized via FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (1). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (3) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO3H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller&#8208;sized precursors containing one (4) or two CP units (5) were tested. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis also revealed that there is no close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between neighboring &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl3 while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO3H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties.

         <title>CaMn3IVO4 Cubane Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex: Spin Ground States S&lt;9/2 and the Effect of Oxo Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17671-17679, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To better describe the Sn&#8208;state intermediates of Photosystem&#8197;II, a ferromagnetically coupled CaMn3IVO4 subunit with an S=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic&#8208;structure studies of CaMn3IVO4 complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.







Abstract
We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn3IVO4 and YMn3IVO4 complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin&#8208;state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn3IVO4 complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be S=9/2. Desymmetrization of the pseudo&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric Ca(Y)Mn3IVO4 core leads to a lower S=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an S=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn3IVO3(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low&#8208;spin and high&#8208;spin forms of the S2 state is pH&#8208;dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin&#8208;state changes.

&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; subunit with an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic-structure studies of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and YMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin-state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=9/2. Desymmetrization of the &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric Ca(Y)Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core leads to a lower &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low-spin and high-spin forms of the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; state is pH-dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin-state changes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Facet Selectivity Guided Assembly of Nanoarchitectures onto Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17564-17569, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective nanostructure was constructed by assembly of anisotropic upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) nanosheets. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures possess facet selectivity and they display specific optical properties that are advantageous in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.







Abstract
Facet&#8208;selective nanostructures in living systems usually exhibit outstanding optical and enzymatic properties, playing important roles in photonics, matter exchange, and biocatalysis. Bioinspired construction of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures offers great opportunities for sophisticated nanomaterials, but remains a formidable task. We have developed a macromolecule&#8208;mediated strategy for the assembly of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)/two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) heterostructures with facet selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be utilized as an interface&#8208;selective mediator to further promote the facet&#8208;selective assembly of MOFs onto the surface of UCNPs. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures with facet selectivity display specific optical properties and show great advantages in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Our demonstration of UCNPs/2DMOFs provides a vivid example for the controlled fabrication of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures and can promote the development of advanced functional materials for applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and information assurance.

Polymersomes with inherent aggregation&#8208;induced emission are presented that have mitochondrial targeting capacity due to the presence of pyridinium groups. The AIEgenic polymersomes, upon encapsulation of photosensitizers, show efficient energy transfer to enable photodynamic therapy, which improves the therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Biodegradable nanostructures displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) are desirable from a biomedical point of view, due to the advantageous features of loading capacity, emission brightness, and fluorescence stability. Herein, biodegradable polymers comprising poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;P(CLgTMC)), with tetraphenylethylene pyridinium&#8208;TMC (PAIE) side chains have been developed, which self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined polymersomes. The resultant AIEgenic polymersomes are intrinsically fluorescent delivery vehicles. The presence of the pyridinium moiety endows the polymersomes with mitochondrial targeting ability, which improves the efficiency of co&#8208;encapsulated photosensitizers and improves therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This contribution showcases the ability to engineer AIEgenic polymersomes with structure inherent fluorescence and targeting capacity for enhanced photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Enhancing the Molecular Rigidity and Photovoltaic Performance of Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>

A noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) NoCA&#8208;5 containing two terminal side&#8208;chains (T&#8208;SCs) is reported. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can improve molecular rigidity, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value and lower reorganization free energy. Combining noncovalent conformational locks and T&#8208;SC engineering, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering is an effective strategy to regulate the solubility and packing behavior of organic materials. Recently, a unique strategy, so&#8208;called terminal side&#8208;chain (T&#8208;SC) engineering, has attracted much attention in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), but there is a lack of deep understanding of the mechanism. Herein, a new noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) containing two T&#8208;SCs (NoCA&#8208;5) was designed and synthesized. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can enhance molecular rigidity and intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value, lower reorganization free energy, and shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance in comparison to NoCA&#8208;1. Hence, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%, resulting from a high electron mobility, a short charge&#8208;extraction time, a small Urbach energy (Eu), and a favorable phase separation.

         <title>Li2S6&#8208;Integrated PEO&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17701-17706, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S6 is used as an additive for a PEO&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte and serves to improve the Li+&#8208;ion conductivity of the electrolyte by reducing the crystalline volume in the PEO as well as aiding in the formation of a thin stable layer that stabilizes the interface with lithium metal. This leads to an impressive electrochemical performance at 40&#8201;&#176;C in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells with a lithium metal anode and an LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode.







Abstract
The integration of Li2S6 within a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is demonstrated to improve the polymer electrolyte's ionic conductivity because the strong interplay between O2&#8722;(PEO) and Li+ from Li2S6 reduces the crystalline volume within the PEO. The Li/electrolyte interface is stabilized by the in situ formation of an ultra&#8208;thin Li2S/Li2S2 layer via the reaction between Li2S6 and lithium metal, which increases the ionic transport at the interface and suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the Li2S6&#8208;integrated composite electrolyte has excellent cyclability and a high critical current density of 0.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 and high&#8208;voltage Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells at 40&#8201;&#176;C.

The Li/electrolyte interface is stabilized by the in situ formation of an ultra-thin Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer via the reaction between Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and lithium metal, which increases the ionic transport at the interface and suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-integrated composite electrolyte has excellent cyclability and a high critical current density of 0.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is demonstrated with all-solid-state Li/LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and high-voltage Li/LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells at 40&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17491-17496, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, enantioselective synthesis of parallel GDGT&#8208;0 is reported using a global asymmetric hydrogenation to set all 16 methyl stereocenters. An unprecedented macrolactonization&#8208;hydrosilylation sequence then constructs the 72&#8208;membered macrocyclic lipid. Desymmetrization enabled the synthesis of a GDGT&#8208;0 with different headgroups. Phase transition and self&#8208;assembly studies gave evidence that the lipids form fluid giant unilamellar vesicles.







Abstract
Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Alleged Structure of Crenarchaeol Enables Structure Revision**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol and comparison with the natural isolate has led to a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted. The synthesis featured an asymmetric intermolecular Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type alkylation to access the unusual 5&#8208;6&#8208;ring motif as well as a late stage ring&#8208;closing metathesis to access the 66&#8208;membered macrocycle of crenarchaeol.







Abstract
Crenarchaeol is a glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid produced exclusively in Archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This membrane&#8208;spanning lipid is undoubtedly the structurally most sophisticated of all known archaeal lipids and an iconic molecule in organic geochemistry. The 66&#8208;membered macrocycle possesses a unique chemical structure featuring 22 mostly remote stereocenters, and a cyclohexane ring connected by a single bond to a cyclopentane ring. Herein we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol. Comparison with natural crenarchaeol allowed us to propose a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted.

         <title>3D&#8208;Positioning of Nanoparticles in High&#8208;Curvature Block Copolymer Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17539-17546, August 2, 2021. </description>

By directly linking nanoparticles to block copolymers, defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assemblies can be realized within domain unit cells. The block length ratio is the most important parameter determining the lattice type. Volume fractions of domains with large positive curvature of only one percent are already sufficient to destabilize lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces.







Abstract
The defined assembly of nanoparticles in polymer matrices is an important precondition for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Here we demonstrate that a defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assembly within the unit cells can be realized by directly linking the nanoparticles to block copolymers. We show that for a range of nearly symmetric to unsymmetric block copolymers there are only two formed structures, a hexagonal lattice of P6/mmm&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in 1D&#8208;arrays within the cylindrical domains, and a cubic lattice of Im3m&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in the octahedral voids of a BCC&#8208;lattice, corresponding to the structure of ferrite steel. We observe the block length ratio and thus the interfacial curvature to be the most important parameter determining the lattice type. This is rationalized in terms of minimal chain extension such that domain topologies with large positive curvature are highly preferred. Already volume fractions of only one percent are sufficient to destabilize a lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces. The study thus demonstrates how nanoparticles can be located on well&#8208;defined positions in three&#8208;dimensional unit cells of block copolymer nanocomposites. This opens the way to functional 3D&#8208;nanocomposites where the nanoparticles need to be located on defined matrix positions.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17587-17594, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization protocol relying on the selective recognition of the [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions by the exo&#8208;binding of cucurbit[6]uril has been demonstrated. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal scrap in a fast, efficient, and highly selective manner.







Abstract
The recognition and separation of anions attracts attention from chemists, materials scientists, and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to selectively recognize anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. We report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianion recognition is driven by weak [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O] ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. Recognition is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and six other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions from a mixture of [PtCl6]2&#8722;, [PdCl4]2&#8722;, and [RhCl6]3&#8722; anions. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.

&#947;&#8208;Alumina is one of the oldest and largest&#8208;scale commercial catalytic materials, but the precise identification of its catalytically active sites has remained elusive. With the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FTIR, high&#8208;field solid state NMR, and HRTEM techniques, clarification of the nature of the active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina is proposed.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina that are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. By using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al+3O5 sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites produce well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkoxy&#8208; and Hydroxy&#8208;Carbonylations of Functionalized Alkenes Assisted by &#946;&#8208;Carbonyl Groups</title>

An efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity as rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
As a fundamental type of carbonylation reaction, the alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons constitutes one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. However, owing to the difficulties in controlling multi&#8208;selectivities for asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, this reaction is typically limited to vinylarenes and analogues. In this work, a highly efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity from broadly available alkenes, CO, and nucleophiles (&gt;90 examples, 84&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). This protocol features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and the products can be readily transformed into a diverse array of chiral heterocycles. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity, which facilitates chiral induction by coordination to the transition metal as rationalized by DFT calculations. The strategy of utilizing an innate functional group as the directing group on the alkene substrate might find further applications in catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonylation reactions.

         <title>Designing Cation&#8211;Solvent Fully Coordinated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Full Cell Based On Solid&#8211;Solid Conversion</title>

A cation&#8211;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte simultaneously resolves the problems at both the Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Benefitting from the electrolyte solvation structure, a long&#8208;life and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell was prepared. (solvent separated ion pair (SSIP), contact ion pair (CIP), aggregate (AGG).)







Abstract
Sulfur chemistry based on solid&#8211;liquid dissolution&#8208;deposition route inevitably encounters shuttle of lithium polysulfides, its parasitic interaction with lithium (Li) anode and flood electrolyte environment. The sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode favors solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism in carbonate ester electrolytes but fails to pair high&#8208;capacity Li anode. Herein, we rationally design a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte to simultaneously resolve the problems of both Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly suppressed solvent activity and a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated structure (molar ratio 1:1). Consequently, Li electrodeposit evolves into round&#8208;edged morphology, LiF&#8208;rich interphase, and high reversibility. Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherits a neat solid&#8208;phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Finally, we harvest a long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra&#8208;lean electrolyte design (1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgS&#8722;1), delivering 394&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Branched Aromatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17680-17685, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transaminase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution was developed for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;branched aromatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The reaction was facilitated by the use of a thermophilic enzyme that tolerates elevated temperatures and pH values and exhibits broad substrate promiscuity. The utility of the process was demonstrated in the total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A (see scheme).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched noncanonical amino acids are valuable molecules in modern drug development efforts. However, they are still challenging to prepare due to the need to set multiple stereocenters in a stereoselective fashion, and contemporary methods for the synthesis of such compounds often rely on the use of rare&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts with designer ligands. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic transamination method to prepare a broad range of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies show that the transformation proceeds through dynamic kinetic resolution that is unique to the optimal enzyme. To highlight its utility and practicality, the biocatalytic reaction was applied to the synthesis of several sp3&#8208;rich cyclic fragments and the first total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A.

         <title>Phosphorus and Arsenic Atom Transfer to Isocyanides to Form &#960;&#8208;Backbonding Cyanophosphide and Cyanoarsenide Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17595-17600, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pnictogen atom transfer from Na(OCE) salts (E=P, As) to a TiII&#8208;bound isocyanide provides entry to phosphorus and arsenic analogues of organic isothiocyanates. The low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing TiII complex, [(TptBu,Me)TiCl], promotes these reactions by trapping the so&#8208;formed cyanophosphide and cyanoarsenide ligands, which display an unusual &#951;3&#8208;coordination mode due to &#960;&#8208;backbonding.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Pnictogen atom transfer from Na(OCE) salts (E=P, As) to a Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-bound isocyanide provides entry to phosphorus and arsenic analogues of organic isothiocyanates. The low-coordinate and highly reducing Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex, [(Tp&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu,Me&lt;/sup&gt;)TiCl], promotes these reactions by trapping the so-formed cyanophosphide and cyanoarsenide ligands, which display an unusual &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination mode due to &#960;-backbonding.

         <title>Isoreticular Crystallization of Highly Porous Cubic Covalent Organic Cage Compounds**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Isoreticular porous materials are obtained after crystallization of cubic organic cages with varying alkyl chains at the edges. Nitrogen sorption measurements revealed exceptionally high surface areas up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volumes up to 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intricate three&#8208;dimensional array of alternating intrinsic and extrinsic pores remains intact upon solvent removal and pore sizes are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents.







Abstract
Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position. n&#8208;Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#8197;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.

         <title>Ultralight Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17547-17555, August 2, 2021. </description>

Ultralight electrolytes with a density of 0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 were proposed by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether. A weight reduction of more than 30&#8201;% per volume was realized relative to the conventional electrolyte, also enabling Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. When applied in pouch cells, &#8776;20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved at various E/S ratios.







Abstract
The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li&#8211;S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8211;S batteries using conventional counterparts (&#8776;1.2&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1 and realize a 19.2&#8201;% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) under E/S=3.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Moreover, more than 20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.

         <title>Mechanosynthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Cocrystals: Tuning Order, Functionality and Size in Cocrystal Design**
</title>

Mechanosynthesis gives ternary and quaternary hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic cocrystals held together via synergistic intermolecular interactions. Notably, higher&#8208;order ternary and quaternary cocrystals can be readily obtained either via serial synthetic routes from the individual components or via one&#8208;pot approaches.







Abstract
The ability to rationally design and predictably construct crystalline solids has been the hallmark of crystal engineering research. To date, numerous examples of multicomponent crystals comprising organic molecules have been reported. However, the crystal engineering of cocrystals comprising both organic and inorganic chemical units is still poorly understood and mostly unexplored. Here, we report a new diverse set of higher&#8208;order cocrystals (HOCs) based on the structurally versatile&#8212;yet largely unexplored&#8212;phosph(V/V)azane heterosynthon building block. The novel ternary and quaternary cocrystals reported are held together by synergistic and orthogonal intermolecular interactions. Notably, the HOCs can be readily obtained either via sequential or one&#8208;pot mechanochemical methods. Computational modelling methods reveal that the HOCs are thermodynamically driven to form and that their mechanical properties strongly depend on the composition and intermolecular forces in the crystal, offering untapped potential for optimizing material properties.

         <title>Highly Controlled Janus Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as a Versatile Photoacoustic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17647-17653, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture following a self&#8208;assembly approach, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of PA agents, combined modular PA properties, and independent responsiveness.







Abstract
Controlling the structural order of nanoparticles (NPs), morphology, and composition is of paramount significance in tailoring the physical properties of nanoassembly. However, the commonly reported symmetrical nanocomposites often suffer an interference or sacrifice of the photophysical properties of the original components. To address this challenge, we developed a novel type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of components, combined modular optical properties, and independent stimuli. As a proof of concept, JNCPs were prepared by incorporating two photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents, namely an organic semiconducting dye and responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNP) assembly in separate compartments of JNCP. Theoretical simulation results confirmed that the formation mechanism of JNCPs arises from the entropy equilibrium in the system. The AuNP assembly generated a PA images with the variation of pH, while the semiconducting molecule served as an internal PA standard agent, leading to ratiometric PA imaging of pH. JNCP based probe holds great potential for real&#8208;time and accurate detection of diverse biological targets in living systems.

         <title>Bridging Thermal Catalysis and Electrocatalysis: Catalyzing CO2 Conversion with Carbon&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17472-17480, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite similar underlying phenomena, studies that directly analogize between thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis are rare. Here, we employ a Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst that is thermally stable and electronically conductive to show that high selectivity CO production is observed under both electrochemical CO2 reduction conditions and thermal reverse&#8208;water gas shift environments.







Abstract
Understanding the differences between reactions driven by elevated temperature or electric potential remains challenging, largely due to materials incompatibilities between thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic environments. We show that Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon (NiPACN), an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2R), can also selectively catalyze thermal CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) representing a direct analogy between catalytic phenomena across the two reaction environments. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that NiPACN likely facilitates RWGS on dispersed Ni sites in agreement with CO2R active site studies. Finally, we construct a generalized reaction driving&#8208;force that includes temperature and potential and suggest that NiPACN could facilitate faster kinetics in CO2R relative to RWGS due to lower intrinsic barriers. This report motivates further studies that quantitatively link catalytic phenomena across disparate reaction environments.

         <title>A Unified Approach for the Total Synthesis of cyclo&#8208;Archaeol, iso&#8208;Caldarchaeol, Caldarchaeol, and Mycoketide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17497-17503, August 2, 2021. </description>

Cyclo&#8208;archaeol, iso&#8208;caldarchaeol, caldarchaeol, and mycoketide are prepared by employing asymmetric hydrogenation to generate the multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy par excellence to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established 13C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>

Hollow Au/Pt&#8208;based nanostructures, resembling an &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology, have been synthesized by a dynamic&#8208;casting approach utilizing a silica yolk&#8208;shell cast. These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti&#8208;cancer drug molecules efficiently.







Abstract
Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases**
</title>

Re&#8208;engineering of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is challenging due to their protein size up to a few megadalton. The artificial splitting of NRPSs to produce building blocks with moderate size is achieved by the introduction of synthetic zippers, which can be recombined in a rapid and simple plug and play manner to form an in trans regulated synthetic type of NRPSs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Extending from the recently introduced definition of eXchange Units (XUs), we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.

A photocharging/discharging strategy is used to initiate the WO3 electrode and prolong charge carrier lifetime for the oxygen evolution reaction. A WO3/CuO photoanode exhibited an outstanding photocurrent with a low onset potential. The prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3 and the electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors were clarified using the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT.







Abstract
A photocharge/discharge strategy is proposed to initiate the WO3 photoelectrode and suppress the main charge recombination, which remarkably improves the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The photocharged WO3 surrounded by a 8&#8211;10&#8197;nm overlayer and oxygen vacancies could be operated more than 25&#8197;cycles with 50&#8197;h durability without significant decay on PEC activity. A photocharged WO3/CuO photoanode exhibits an outstanding photocurrent of 3.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE with a low onset potential of 0.6&#8197;VRHE, which is one of the best performances of p&#8208;n heterojunction structure. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT, we clarify the prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3, as well as how electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors enable the effective photoinduced electrons transfer from WO3 into CuO. This work provides a feasible route to address excessive defects existed in photoelectrodes without causing extra recombination.

         <title>SO2 Capture Using Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17556-17563, August 2, 2021. </description>

Porous organic cages (POCs) were investigated for the first time for the capture of SO2. A tertiary amine cage (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated remarkably high SO2 capture that was perfectly reversible for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles.







Abstract
We report the first experimental investigation of porous organic cages (POCs) for the demanding challenge of SO2 capture. Three structurally related N&#8208;containing cage molecular materials were studied. An imine&#8208;functionalized POC (CC3) showed modest and reversible SO2 capture, while a secondary&#8208;amine POC (RCC3) exhibited high but irreversible SO2 capture. A tertiary amine POC (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated very high SO2 capture (13.78&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1; 16.4&#8201;SO2 molecules per cage) combined with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles. The adsorption behavior was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, 13C&#8197;CP&#8208;MAS NMR experiments, and computational calculations.

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17735-17743, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic behaviors of bifunctional oxide&#8208;zeolite catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 were significantly influenced by element migration, which was dependent on the type of oxides and affected synergy of the two functional components.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In2O3, ZnO, Cr2O3, and ZrO2) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C2+ hydrocarbon products over In2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO2/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C2+ hydrocarbons.

         <title>Capturing Visible Light in Low&#8208;Band&#8208;Gap C4N&#8208;Derived Responsive Bifunctional Air Electrodes for Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17615-17621, August 2, 2021. </description>

A narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap C4N material was explored as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) organic bifunctional oxygen catalyst for application in photocoupled secondary batteries. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZAB) and all&#8208;polymer polymer&#8208;air batteries (RPAB) exhibited markedly reduced charge voltage together with an increased energy efficiency under visible light.







Abstract
We report facile synthesis of low&#8208;band&#8208;gap mesoporous C4N particles and their use as responsive bifunctional oxygen catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (RZAB) and polymer&#8208;air battery (RPAB). Compared to widely studied g&#8208;C3N4, C4N shows a smaller band gap of 1.99&#8197;eV, with a larger photocurrent response, and it can function as visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalysts, enabling effective photocoupling to tune oxygen catalysis. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS&#8208;RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35&#8197;V under visible light, which is below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65&#8197;V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78&#8201;%. Pairing a C4N cathode with a polymer anode also endows an VLS&#8208;RPAB with light&#8208;boosted charge performance. It is revealed that the ORR and OER active sites in C4N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine&#8208;nitrogen atoms and photogenerated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics.

Guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er).







Abstract
The enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is efficient for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines, but the catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). The reaction is very efficient: lowering catalyst loadings for the model reaction to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, enantioselectivity is still maintained. The synthetic utility was confirmed by transformations of the products. DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.

     alt="Catalytic Asymmetric Aza-Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Ketimines and Unactivated Dienes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2-aryl-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indol-3-ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is efficient for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines, but the catalytic asymmetric aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2-aryl-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indol-3-ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). The reaction is very efficient: lowering catalyst loadings for the model reaction to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, enantioselectivity is still maintained. The synthetic utility was confirmed by transformations of the products. DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liposomes with Water as a pH&#8208;Responsive Functionality for Targeting of Acidic Tumor and Infection Sites</title>

A new lipid, DCPA, was prepared, possessing a hydrophilic, pyridine betaine group that can be hydrogen&#8208;bonded with water yielding DCPA&#8208;H2O. Self&#8208;assembled DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes become rapidly protonated at relatively high pH (&lt;7.0) due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. As a result, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes target faster to solid tumors and infectious biofilms than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes.







Abstract
A lipid named DCPA was synthesized under microwave&#8208;assisted heating. DCPA possesses a pyridine betaine, hydrophilic group that can be complexed with water through hydrogen bonding (DCPA&#8208;H2O). DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes became protonated relatively fast already at pH&lt;6.8, due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. In murine models, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes had longer blood circulation times than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes, while after tail&#8208;vein injection DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes targeted faster to solid tumors and intra&#8208;abdominal infectious biofilms. Therapeutic efficacy in a murine, infected wound&#8208;healing model of tail&#8208;vein injected ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes exceeded the ones of clinically applied ciprofloxacin as well as of ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DPPC or DCPM liposomes.

         <title>Highly Soluble Supertetrahedra upon Selective Partial Butylation of Chalcogenido Metalate Clusters in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17622-17628, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective access to partially butylated supertetrahedral clusters [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; was achieved by employing a di&#8208;butylated ionic liquid as reaction medium and alkylation agent. In contrast to purely inorganic [Sn10O4S20]8&#8722;, the butylated analogs are soluble in solvents like CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, without losing the typical opto&#8208;electronic properties. Solution&#8208;NMR data were assigned with the help of newly developed all&#8208;electron relativistic DFT methods.







Abstract
Supertetrahedral clusters have been reported in two generally different types so far: one type possessing an organic ligand shell, no or low charges, and high solubility, while the other cluster type is ligand&#8208;free with usually high charges and low or no solubility in common solvents. The latter is a tremendous disadvantage regarding further use of the clusters in solution. However, as organic substituents usually broaden the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, which cannot be overcompensated by the (limited) cluster sizes, a full organic shielding comes along with drawbacks regarding opto&#8208;electronic properties. We therefore sought to find a way of generating soluble clusters with a minimum number of organic substituents. Here, we present the synthesis and full characterization of two salts of [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; that are high soluble in CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, which includes first NMR and mass spectra obtained from solutions of such salts with mostly inorganic supertetrahedral clusters. The optical absorption properties of this new class of compounds indicates nearly unaffected band gaps. The synthetic approach and the spectroscopic findings were rationalized and explained by means of high&#8208;level quantum chemical studies.

         <title>Branched Aggregates with Tunable Morphology via Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Azobenzene&#8208;Derived Molecular Double Brushes</title>

Diverse branched supermicelles can be prepared by particle&#8211;particle connection of primary tapered worm&#8208;like aggregates from azobenzene&#8208;containing Janus molecular double brushes (MDBs), which further enables biomimetic morphology evolution from Antedon&#8208; to starfish&#8208;shaped architectures upon UV irradiation.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly is one of the most effective approaches to fabricate nature&#8208;inspired materials with subtle nanostructures. We report a distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process of molecular double brushes (MDBs) with each graft site carrying a poly(azobenzene&#8208;acrylate) (PAzo) chain and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain. Asymmetric tapered worm (ATW) nanostructures with chain&#8208;end reactivity assembling from the azobenzene&#8208;derived MDBs serve as primary subunits to prepare branched supermicelles by increasing water content (Cw) in THF/water. Various natural Antedon&#8208;shaped multiarm worm&#8208;like aggregates (MWAs) can be created via the particle&#8211;particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo trans&#8211;cis isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs. Multiscale supermicelles comprised of starfish shapes with differing central body and arm morphologies (e.g., compare to the biological specimens Luidia ciliaris and Crossaster papposus) were prepared by manipulating irradiation time.

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy&#8208;Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A robust route simultaneously allows effective defect passivation and reduced energy difference between the valence band edge of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of strongly polar molecules at the perovskite/HTL interface.







Abstract
The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20&#8201;% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;Low Thermal Conductivity Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>

The high thermoelectric performance in SnTe is demonstrated via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and inhibition of the phonon propagation.







Abstract
SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric (TE) material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for TE energy conversion. Herein, we demonstrate a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the TE performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between two uppermost valence bands (&#916;Ev) decreases to 0.10&#8197;eV in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te compared to 0.35&#8197;eV in pristine SnTe. The optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands gave a high power factor of ca. 27&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.23&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 865&#8197;K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. These combined effects resulted in a high TE figure of merit, zT&#8776;1.55 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.

         <title>Tight Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport via Molecular Precursor Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17638-17646, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular precursor engineering was implemented for modular fabrication of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The COF membranes fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process with more hydrophilic aldehyde precursors exhibited tighter structure than the COF membranes fabricated via interfacial polymerization process with less hydrophilic aldehydes, thus achieving the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity.







Abstract
Fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membranes with tight structure, which can fully utilize well&#8208;defined framework structure and thus achieve superior conduction performance, remains a grand challenge. Herein, through molecular precursor engineering of COFs, we reported the fabrication of tight COFs membrane with the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 100&#8201;% RH. Six quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized COFs were synthesized by assembling functional hydrazides and different aldehyde precursors. In an organic&#8208;aqueous reaction system, the impact of the aldehyde precursors with different size, electrophilicity and hydrophilicity on the reaction&#8208;diffusion process for fabricating COFs membranes was elucidated. Particularly, more hydrophilic aldehydes were prone to push the reaction zone from the interface region to the aqueous phase of the reaction system, the tight membranes were thus fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process, conferring around 4&#8211;8 times the anion conductivity over the loose membranes via interfacial polymerization process.

Anisotropic synthetic melanins have been generated by solid&#8208;state polymerization, as reported by Nathan&#8197;C. Gianneschi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;17464. Ellipsoidal platelets of melanin, found to date only in biology, were obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the 4&#8208;4&#8242; dihydroxynaphthalene dimer as the building block, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to give polymeric melanin materials without changing their overall morphology.

         <dc:description>
The helical twisting power of neat as well as several surface&#8208;functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs*), exhibiting innate molecular and structural chirality, was evaluated in a nematic liquid crystal as a reporter medium. In their Communication on page&#8197;17344, Diana P.&#8197;N. Gon&#231;alves and Torsten Hegmann report that all CNC* species were able to induce and amplify chirality at the nanoscale level, especially those functionalized with mesogenic molecules that better resembled the N&#8208;LC host molecules. Surface functionalization with chiral molecules did not appear to enhance the helical twisting power of the CNCs, thereby supporting the role of innate nanocrystal core chirality.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: SO2 Capture Using Porous Organic Cages (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 32/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17747-17747, August 2, 2021. </description>

A functionalized porous organic cage (POC) demonstrating high SO2 capture capability and reversibility is reported by Andrew&#8197;I. Cooper, Ilich&#8197;A. Ibarra, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;17556. The main source of SO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels, and alkaline scrubber&#8208;based technologies are the main desulphurization methods in industry, which often cause corrosion of pipes and generate huge amounts of wastewater. With good processibility and proven scalability, POC materials offer a more sustainable option for SO2 capture.

Archaeal lipids have been prepared by iridium&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation, as reported by Adriaan&#8197;J. Minnaard et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;17497. Geranylgeraniol, extracted from Bixa orellana seeds, flows in the carafe with the iridium catalyst. The carafe symbolises Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, after which iridium has been named. The final products are poured from it. Mycoketide, produced by M.&#8197;tuberculosis, is depicted with a picture of the bacterium. The membrane&#8208;spanning lipids are represented by glucosylated caldarchaic acid, the grand prismatic spring in Yellowstone, and a picture of the prepared giant unilamellar vesicles.

A critical link between the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites (mixed Cu+&#8208; and Cu0&#8208;, Cu+&#8208;, and Cu0&#8208;dominated) and their unique selectivity toward the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (yielding C2H4/C2H5OH, CO/HCOO&#8722;, and CH4, respectively) is put forward. This may be a valuable tool for fine&#8208;tuning the Cu surface state toward distinct CO2RR pathways.







Abstract
The promoted activity and enhanced selectivity of electrocatalysts is commonly ascribed to specific structural features such as surface facets, morphology, and atomic defects. However, unraveling the factors that really govern the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is still very challenging since the surface state of electrocatalysts is dynamic and difficult to predict under working conditions. Moreover, theoretical predictions from the viewpoint of thermodynamics alone often fail to specify the actual configuration of a catalyst for the dynamic CO2RR process. Herein, we re&#8208;survey recent studies with the emphasis on revealing the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites under CO2RR conditions extracted by in situ/operando characterizations, and further validate a critical link between the chemical state of Cu and the product profile of CO2RR. This point of view provides a generalizable concept of dynamic chemical&#8208;state&#8208;driven CO2RR selectivity that offers an inspiration in both fundamental understanding and efficient electrocatalysts design.

         <title>Prevent or Cure&#8212;The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>

Are we facing the hard realities imparted by the limitations of self&#8208;healing materials? The answer lies in self&#8208;reporting materials. Prior to any self&#8208;healing processes, potential system changes along damages need to be detected and reported in a visual fashion. This review highlights the mechanisms of self&#8208;reporting materials and the challenges that need to be overcome to enable real&#8208;world applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials, and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, for example, prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.

Near&#8208;infrared enzyme&#8208;activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be an effective tool for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. This review focuses on the design strategy of enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes, the development of biological applications and new multifunctional probes as well as the direction of clinical transformation.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be the effective edge tools for the investigation of cell biology and disease diagnosis because of their outstanding advantages. Related genes involved in tumor genesis and progression regulate the overexpression of certain enzymes. Owing to the distinctive characteristics of quick reaction time and favorable pharmacokinetics, enzyme&#8208;reactive NIR optical probes have shown great potential in the diagnosis of tumorigenesis and in image&#8208;guided intraoperative surgeries with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. In this review, we mainly summarize the latest advancements in enzyme&#8208;reactive NIR fluorescent probes from design strategy to biomedical application. Specifically, some challenges and prospects in this field are presented at the end of the review, which will be beneficial to innovatively construct new multifunctional fluorescent probes and actively promote their clinical transformation in the future.

Hollow MOFs show outstanding properties in catalysis, separation, storage, sensing and energy applications resulting from their tunable composition/structure versatility and designability, exceeding the molecular scale. In this review, synthetic strategies for engineering hollow MOFs and their applications are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring porous crystalline structures with coordinated metal nodes and organic linkers, have recently found increasing interest in diverse applications. By virtue of their versatile and highly tunable compositions and structures, constructing hollow architectures will further endow MOFs with enhanced properties and designability, exceeding the molecular scale. MOFs could be considered as promising building units to fabricate complex hollow nanocomposites with faster mass transport, multiple active components, more exposed active sites, and better compatibility than bulk MOFs. To construct a promising blueprint for hollow pristine MOFs, this review provides a comprehensive overview for structural design strategies and applications of hollow pristine MOFs. We will highlight the merits, challenges and future potential by structuring and applying MOFs in sensing, separation, storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, photochemical and electrochemical energy conversion. This review might pave a new avenue for future development of novel pristine hollow MOFs.

         <title>Automated Crystal Structure Determination Has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17452-17454, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the previous crystal structure determinations of both modifications of iodine azide half of the X&#8208;ray reflections were missed, resulting in incorrect unit cells, incorrect space groups, and unsatisfactory structural models. Using the old data, but including the missed weak reflections, sensible structures were determined. It pays off to take a skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data and not to rely solely on computer generated models.







Abstract
Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN3) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X&#8208;ray reflections with odd k&#8197;Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions. Using the original diffraction data, refinements with the correct unit cells yield structures of polymeric (&#8722;I&#8722;N3&#8722;)n chains that are interlocked to layers. A skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data is always recommended to overcome the lack of crystallographic expertise of computers at automated structure determinations.

A novel MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP) is prepared and used as the active layer to simulate human memory synapses for the first time. It possesses satisfactory fundamental function of biological synaptic memory. This work demonstrates the tremendous application potential of 2D MOF films in artificial synaptic devices.







Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as the active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including sensors, catalysis, and electronic devices. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated a novel 2D MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP, THPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibits an excellent stability in atmosphere. This work opens the door for the application of 2D MOF film in the simulation of human brain synapses.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Ultrasmall Gold Nanoclusters in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17388-17393, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous nucleation approach has been developed to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters by activated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene moieties in a porous solid&#8208;state matrix. The resultant composite exhibits an activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction four times higher than control materials without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization.







Abstract
Ultrafine gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) are susceptible to migrate and aggregate, even in the porosity of many crystalline solids. N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of structurally diverse ligands for the stabilization of Au&#8208;NCs in homogeneous chemistry, showing catalytic reactivity in CO2 activation. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a heterogeneous nucleation approach to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters in an NHC&#8208;functionalized porous matrix. The sizes of gold nanoclusters are tunable from 1.3&#8197;nm to 1.8&#8197;nm based on the interpenetration of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) topology. Control experiments using amine or imidazolium&#8208;functionalized MOFs afforded the aggregation of Au species. The resultant Au&#8208;NC@MOF composite exhibits a steady and excellent activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, superior to control mixtures without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization. Mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic catalytic effect of MOFs and Au&#8208;NCs through the MOF&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au covalent&#8208;bonding bridges.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Decarboxylation Coupling Facilitated by Lock&#8208;to&#8208;Unlock Variation of Molecules upon the Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17435-17439, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of a new macrocyclic compound by on&#8208;surface decarboxylation coupling was developed. This work opens up a promising route for improving the practicality of on&#8208;surface synthesis in cases that involve high energy barriers as well as achieving the structural homogeneity, which are major unresolved challenges in this field.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) involving relatively high energy barriers remains challenging due to a typical dilemma: firm molecular anchor is required to prevent molecular desorption upon the reaction, whereas sufficient lateral mobility is crucial for subsequent coupling and assembly. By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, we present a strategy to address this challenge. High&#8208;yield synthesis based on well&#8208;defined decarboxylation, intermediate transition, and hexamerization is demonstrated, resulting in an extended and ordered network exclusively composed of the newly synthesized macrocyclic compound. Thanks to the steric hindrance of its maleimide group, we attain a preferential selection of the coupling. This work unlocks a promising path to enrich the reaction types and improve the coupling selectivity hence the structual homogeneity of the final product for OSS.

         <title>Helical Microporous Nanorods Assembled by Polyoxometalate Clusters for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17404-17409, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) assembled by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, in an attempt to combine the superior photocatalytic performance of POMs and the unique structure of microporous materials without loading POMs onto other microporous materials. The HMNRs exhibit an outstanding performance in photocatalytic toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Microporous materials are extensively used in catalysis due to their unique pore structures. Among them, microporous materials loaded with polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibit considerable potential for catalysis thanks to the combination of the outstanding redox&#8208;catalytic properties of POMs and the characteristics of microporous materials. Based on this, we developed a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) using POM clusters as building blocks, combining the properties of both POMs and microporous materials while circumventing the complicated loading process. The HMNRs show an enhanced photocatalytic performance for toluene oxidation. Comparatively high activity, superior selectivity towards benzaldehyde, and prominent cycling stability were achieved, manifesting a promising prospect for a future application in photocatalysis.

By taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition at the oil&#8208;water interface, photoresponsive interfacial assemblies with jammed nanoparticle surfactants are present. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the nanoparticle surfactants from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart interfacial systems.







Abstract
The jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interface imparts attractive properties to the interfacial assemblies and enables the structuring of liquids. Herein, we report photoresponsive supramolecular microcapsules with jammed NPS assemblies at the oil&#8208;water interface, taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the NPSs from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart microcapsule systems.

The adsorption capacity of ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol for C2H2 increases by 130&#8201;% (298&#8197;K) compared with ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;NH2, and it exhibits promising C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation performance.







Abstract
Isoreticular functionalization is a well&#8208;elucidated strategy for pore environment tuning and the basis of gas separation performance in extended frameworks. The extension of this approach to discrete porous molecules such as metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is conceptually straightforward but hindered by synthetic complications, especially stability concerns. We report the successful isoreticular functionalization of a zirconium MOC with tetrazole moiety by bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The title compound (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) shows promising C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation performance, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments, and density functional theory calculations. The design analogy between MOFs and highly stable MOCs may guide the synthesis of novel porous materials for challenging separation applications.

         <title>Be2(BO3)(IO3): The First Anion&#8208;mixed Van der Waals Member in the KBe2BO3F2 Family with a Very Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17415-17418, August 2, 2021. </description>

Be2(BO3)(IO3) is the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal. It is also the first anion&#8208;mixed van der Waals member in the KBe2BO3F2 family with a very strong second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
To obtain new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with a large second harmonic generation (SHG) effect has always been a great challenge. We have synthesized the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal, Be2(BO3)(IO3) (BBIO), by multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the structural features of KBBF were maintained and (IO3)&#8722; groups were connected to honeycomb [Be2BO3O2]&#8734; layers. As the first KBBF family member with mixed anionic groups, BBIO benefited from the synergistic effect of (IO3)&#8722;, (BO3)3&#8722; and (BeO4)6&#8722; groups, and exhibited a very strong SHG response of &#8776;7.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP, @1064&#8197;nm) and a large birefringence (&#916;n) of 0.172 at 1064&#8197;nm. BBIO may, unexpectedly, optimize growth habits via van der Waals forces. This study presents borate&#8208;iodate as a new NLO material and it demonstrates opportunities in KBBF structural engineering.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Responsive Gene Delivery from Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions through Cleavable Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17362-17367, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;linked poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactant allows for stabilization of perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water nanoemulsions. Upon reduction, the surfactant is cleaved, triggering destabilization and subsequent release of the encapsulated payload. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved selectively in high concentrations of reducing agent, allowing for delivery of fluorous&#8208;tagged plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein.







Abstract
The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in&#8197;cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.

Reactive but easy to handle: For the first time, rare&#8208;earth metals (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tm, Y, Sc) are obtained as high&#8208;quality nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm in size) in the liquid phase. They can be highly interesting as reactive starting materials to realize new rare&#8208;earth metal compounds and/or phase&#8208;pure rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm)&#8212;ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#8197;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#8197;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal&#8212;is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspensions and powders under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8211;organic compounds at room temperature.

         <title>Reducing Defects Density and Enhancing Hole Extraction for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ Interactions</title>

Featuring a fused tricyclic core, an organic small molecule was intentionally synthesized to reduce defects density and improve hole transportation in perovskite devices via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, confirmed by multiple characterizations and simulation.







Abstract
Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed high efficiency of 21.41&#8201;% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.

In addition, this doping via &#960;-Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed high efficiency of 21.41&#8201;% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core-based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Oxidation Greatly Promoted by Chlorine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17398-17403, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient CH4 electro&#8208;oxidation system was developed. The electrochemical generation of surface&#8208;adsorbed *Cl intermediates was stabilized by mixed Co&#8211;Ni spinels and allowed to effectively convert CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, with an outstanding yield of CH3Cl and a high selectivity at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered methane (CH4) conversion at ambient conditions is an attractive but highly challenging field. Due to the highly inert character of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C&#8722;H bond without over&#8208;oxidation is essential for transforming CH4 into value&#8208;added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4 conversion approach at room temperature using intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled an effective activation and conversion of CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, and Ni3+ at the octahedral sites in the mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels allowed to stabilize surface&#8208;bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and a high CH3Cl/CO2 selectivity of over 400 at room temperature, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4 conversion under seawater working conditions.

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Realize Surface Reconstruction of Small&#8208;Sized Platinum&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17430-17434, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy has been proposed for the precise surface reconstruction of Pt&#8208;based nanoparticles. The reconstructed nanoparticles display excellent stability at high temperature, yet serve as highly active and selective catalysts for the hydrogenations of phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
Over the past decades, despite the substantial efforts that have been devoted to the modifications of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to tailor their selectivities for hydrogenation reactions, there are still a lack of facile strategies for precisely regulation of the surface properties of NPs, especially for those with small sizes. In this work, we propose a top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy for tuning the surface properties of Pt&#8208;based NPs (&#8776;4&#8197;nm) without the occurrence of aggregation. Compared to conventional bottom&#8208;up methods, the present top&#8208;down strategy can precisely regulate the surface compositions of Pt&#8208;Cd NPs and other ternary Pt&#8208;Cd&#8208;M NPs (M=Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Sn). The optimized Pt&#8208;Cd NPs exhibit excellent selectivity toward phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenations with a styrene selectivity and 4&#8208;aminophenyl styrene selectivity of 95.2&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;%, respectively. This work provides a general strategy for the surface reconstructions of Pt&#8208;based NPs, and promotes fundamental research on catalyst design for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Shows Modafinil, A Student Study Drug, Changes the Lipid Composition of the Fly Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17378-17382, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modafinil, used for sleep disorder treatment, appears to enhance attention as well as improve learning and memory. Imaging mass spectrometry is used to investigate the effects of modafinil on the alteration of lipid composition on fly brain. Modafinil induces a decrease in PC and SM contents and increases the levels of PEs and PIs. The lipid changes caused by modafinil are similar to the effects of methylphenidate, which also improves cognition.







Abstract
Modafinil, a widely used psychoactive drug, has been shown to exert a positive impact on cognition and is used to treat sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging, we studied the changes of brain lipids of Drosophila melanogaster induced by modafinil to gain insight into the functional mechanism of modafinil in the brain. We found that upon modafinil treatment, the abundance of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species in the central brain of Drosophila is significantly decreased, whereas the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol in the brains show significant enhancement compared to the control flies. The alteration of brain lipids caused by modafinil is consistent with previous studies about cognition&#8208;related drugs and offers a plausible mechanism regarding the action of modafinil in the brain as well as a potential target for the treatment of certain disorders.

 branched polyiodate chains and high SHG effect. The asymmetric (o&#8208;C5H4NHOH)+ is in favor of polymerization and inducing the formation of the NCS structure.







Abstract
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyiodate, namely, [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I), featuring a novel branched polyiodate chain has been obtained by evaporation method. [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I) crystalizes in the polar space group Ia and features an [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chain in which [I3O9]3&#8722; trimers are grafted on the same side of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain based on [I4O11(OH)]3&#8722; tetramers. The asymmetric organic amine groups are beneficial to the polymerization of iodate groups and inducing the formation of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure. Compound I exhibits a rather large Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208; Generation (SHG) signal of 8.5&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) upon 1064&#8197;nm laser radiation, a moderate band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a high laser&#8208;induced&#8208;damage&#8208;threshold (LIDT) of 182.34&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, hence it is a promising new SHG material. The relationship between the structures of the organic amine groups and the overall structures has been also analyzed.

Compound &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a rather large Second-Harmonic- Generation (SHG) signal of 8.5&#215;KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (KDP) upon 1064&#8197;nm laser radiation, a moderate band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a high laser-induced-damage-threshold (LIDT) of 182.34&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, hence it is a promising new SHG material. The relationship between the structures of the organic amine groups and the overall structures has been also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>1,3&#8208;Diketone&#8208;Modified Nucleotides and DNA for Cross&#8208;Linking with Arginine&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>

Arginine&#8208;specific 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked reactive nucleotides are reported for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes and cross&#8208;linking with peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Linear or branched 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphate were synthesized through CuAAC click reaction of diketone&#8208;alkynes with 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were good substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase in primer extension synthesis of modified DNA. The nucleotide bearing linear 3,5&#8208;dioxohexyl group (HDO) efficiently reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable pyrimidine&#8208;linked conjugates, whereas the branched 2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;butyl (PDO) group was not reactive. Reaction with Lys or a terminal amino group formed enamine adducts that were prone to hydrolysis. This reactive HDO modification in DNA was used for bioconjugations and cross&#8208;linking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.g. histones).

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Conjoined Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17368-17372, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene conjoined bismacrocycle (SCPP[10]). Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176;. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and PCBM was formed and investigated.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed conjoined (1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twisted benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The conjoined structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.

         <title>Unveiling Five Naked Structures of Tartaric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17410-17414, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational landscape of the chiral and astrochemical tartaric acid molecule has been revealed for the first time using a combination of laser ablation and rotational spectroscopy techniques. Five different structures have been characterized, being ruled by different hydrogen bonding patterns. Also, this data enables the first attempt to detect this molecule in the interstellar medium.







Abstract
The unbiased, naked structures of tartaric acid, one of the most important organic compounds existing in nature and a candidate to be present in the interstellar medium, has been revealed in this work for the first time. Solid samples of its naturally occurring (R,R) enantiomer have been vaporized by laser ablation, expanded in a supersonic jet, and characterized by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. In the isolation conditions of the jet, we have discovered up to five different structures stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond networks dominated by O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O motifs extended along the entire molecule. These five forms, two with an extended (trans) disposition of the carbon chain and three with a bent (gauche) disposition, can serve as a basis to represent the shape of tartaric acid. This work also reports the first set of spectroscopy data that can be used to detect tartaric acid in the interstellar medium.

Reversible Li plating/stripping at both high current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved by designing an ultra&#8208;thin graphene quantum dot overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal.







Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;current&#8208;density and high&#8208;area&#8208;capacity operation of Li metal anodes offers promising opportunities for high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation batteries. However, high&#8208;rate Li deposition suffers from undesired Li&#8208;ion depletion especially at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which compromises achievable capacity and lifetime. Here, electronegative graphene quantum dots are synthesized and assembled into an ultra&#8208;thin overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal to fully relieve Li&#8208;ion depletion. The protected Li anode achieves long&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 1000&#8197;h at both superior current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Implementation of the protected anode allows for the construction of Li&#8208;air full battery with both enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17344-17349, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), neat or surface&#8208;modified with mesogenic motifs, transmit their inherent structural and morphological chirality to an achiral nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) elastic medium with a helical twisting power rivaling the most potent organic chiral dopants. The helical pitch, p, of the induced chiral N*&#8208;LC phase is tightened even when CNCs are decorated with achiral molecules bearing structural resemblance to the N&#8208;LC host.







Abstract
The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Induced Heterogenization of Nickel and Palladium Catalysts for Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17446-17451, August 2, 2021. </description>

An alternative heterogenization approach that uses hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced interactions of a solid support with metal complexes was developed. The resulting heterogeneous nickel and palladium catalysts showed superior properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with great product morphology control.







Abstract
The practical synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefins using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers is a challenge; the use of heterogeneous catalysts is little explored. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous naphthoquinone&#8208;based nickel (Ni/SiO2) and palladium (Pd/SiO2) catalysts through hydrogen bonding interactions of the ligands with the silica surface. Ni/SiO2 exhibits high activities (up to 2.65&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) during the copolymerization of ethylene with 5&#8208;hexene&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;acetate, affording high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (Mn up to 630&#8201;000) polar&#8208;functionalized semicrystalline polyethylene (comonomer incorporation up to 2.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), along with great morphology control. The resulting copolymers possess improved surface properties and great mechanical properties. Pd/SiO2 can mediate ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers with moderate activity to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight copolymers with tunable comonomer incorporation.

         <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17350-17355, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 coupled with finite element simulation, we reveal strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox reaction is sluggish at low SOC, but increases rapidly as SOC increases. The kinetic limitation at low SOC can be alleviated through interaction with polycrystals integrated into the same electrode.







Abstract
High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the ionic transport and kinetic properties. We report here a quantitative assessment of redox reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox is sluggish at low SOC but increases rapidly as SOC increases, both in bulk electrodes and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Allenes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkylation/Defluorination of Propargyl Difluorides with Alkylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of propargyl difluorides R  1  CF  2  C&#8801;CR  2  with alkylzincs R  3  ZnCl giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes R  1  FC=C=CR  2  R  3  with high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at b&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8211;Rh intermediate which is generated by regioselective addition of R  3  &#8211;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the major challenges in the sulfur cathode of the Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling suppressing simultaneously. This issue can be well solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve the high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate the charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses the LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS&#8208;HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS&#8208;HSs electrode with the high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability in the composed Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative strength of intermolecular interaction between adsorbates and substrate influences adsorption behaviour. For Ar, the capillary condensation of ZIF&#8208;412 starts at lower pressure than for MOF&#8208;205 due to different adsorbate&#8211;substrate interactions. However, this effect becomes negligible for adsorbates with strong interaction among adsorbates (CO2).







Abstract
For a better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. We report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas&#8208;adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework is weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 according to their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8211;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherms.

         <title>Improved Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Chiral Co3O4 Supraparticles under Electromagnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance were applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation.







Abstract
One of the most common methods to treat thromboembolism is the use of thrombolytic drugs to activate fibrinolytic protease. The aim of this treatment was to initiate the lysis of fibrin; however, there are many side&#8208;effects associated with this form of treatment. Herein, we fabricated chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). In vitro experiments showed that d&#8208;SPs degraded blood clot within 8&#8197;hours under MF. Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation. The results of mechanism study showed that under MF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by d&#8208;SPs were 1.5 times higher than that of l&#8208;SPs, which might be attributed to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effects.

         <title>Cationic Carbene Analogues: Donor&#8208;Free Phosphenium and Arsenium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;free, kinetically stabilized diarylphosphenium and arsenium ions were obtained using a combination of bulky rigid aryl substituents and a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in the condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron&#8208;rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in the gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents, dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.

         <title>Neutral Unsymmetrical Coordinated Cyclophane Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate how a cyclophane structure can be generated in square&#8208;planar complexes with two different chelating donors (N,O). An ancillary second imine function in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure between two symmetrical 4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl substituted terphenyl motifs.







Abstract
Cyclophane structures can control steric pressure in the otherwise open spaces of square&#8208;planar d8&#8208;metal catalysts. This elegant concept was so far limited to symmetrical coordinated metals. We report how a cyclophane motif can be generated in ligands that chelate via two different donors. An ancillary second imine in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure via olefin metathesis and selective double bond hydrogenation to yield a 30&#8208;membered ring efficiently. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the ancillary imine is directed away from the active site and inert for catalysis. In ethylene polymerization the cyclophane catalyst is more active and temperature stable vs. an open structure reference, notably also in polar solvents. Increased molecular weights and decreased degrees of branching can be traced to an increased energy of sterically demanding transition states by the encircling cyclophane while chain propagation remains highly efficient.

         <title>A Wireframe DNA Cube &#8208; Antibody Conjugate for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Copies of Monomethyl Auristatin E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well&#8208;known that control of drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven. The formation of the ADC is investigated by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. Lastly, the developed MMAE loaded ADC was used for targeted drug delivery in vitro.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well-known that control of drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven.

         <title>Synthesis and Cellular Labeling of Multifunctional Phosphatidylinositol Bis&#8208; and Trisphosphate Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group, a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group, and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry were synthesized. The lipid derivatives readily enter cells and rapid trafficking of uncaged derivatives to the plasma membrane is observed, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved.







Abstract
We synthesized the first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group (&#8220;cage&#8221;), a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group, and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry. We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo&#8208;crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo&#8208;crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3&#8208;binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density 2D Superlattices Assembled via Directional DNA Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubic, octahedral, and rhombic&#8208;dodecahedral (RD) nanoparticle (NP) films are assembled on substrates using DNA. Octahedral and RD films rearrange into novel low&#8208;density 2D structures, which are difficult to access using other methods for assembling NPs into superlattices.







Abstract
It is critical to assemble nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattices with controlled symmetries and spacings on substrates for metamaterials applications, where such structural parameters dictate their properties. Here, we use DNA to assemble anisotropic NPs of three shapes&#8212;cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra&#8212;on substrates and investigate their thermally induced reorganization into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline films. We report two new low&#8208;density 2D structures, including a honeycomb lattice based on octahedral NPs. The low&#8208;density lattices favored here are not usually seen when particles are crystallized via other bottom&#8208;up assembly techniques. Furthermore, we show that, consistent with the complementary contact model, a primary driving force for crystallization is the formation of directional, face&#8208;to&#8208;face DNA bonds between neighboring NPs and between NPs and the substrate. Our results can be used to deliberately prepare crystalline NP films with novel morphologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.</dc:description>

Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven conversion of methane offers a promising approach to directly transform methane to valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains as a grand challenge currently. In this Review, recent advancements of photocatalytic conversion of methane are systematically summarized. Insights into the construction of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts from the perspective of light&#8208;absorption units and active centers are proposed and discussed in detail. Moreover, photocatalytic performances of methane conversion over various catalysts are also presented and classified by oxidant systems.

         <title>Brightening up Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Monosubstituted Polyacetylene by Conformation Control: Mechanism, Switching, and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conjugated polymer monosubstituted polyacetylenes (mono&#8208;PAs) have been generally considered to be non&#8208;emissive. Herein we report the first example of luminescent mono&#8208;PAs based on contracted  cis&#8208;cisoid  polyene backbone, displaying an excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance with a high dissymmetric factor (up to the order of 10  &#8208;1  ). The luminescence stems from the helical  cis&#8208;cisoid  PA backbone, which is tightly fixed by the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby reversing the energy order of excited states and enabling an emissive energy dissipation. CPL switches are facilely achieved by the solvent and temperature through reversible conformational transition. By taking advantages of fast response and high sensitivity, the thin film of mono&#8208;PAs could be used as a CPL&#8208;based probe for quantitative detection of trifluoroacetic acid with a wider linear dynamic range than those of photoluminescence and circular dichroism. This work opens a new avenue to develop novel smart CPL materials through modulating conformational transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic study of the aqueous reaction of organic peroxides with HSO3&#8208; on the surface of a water droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90% vs 40&#8208;70% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8208; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8208; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that the reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the contents of Pt. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the  d  &#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. The PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (~0.026 wt%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 V  RHE  and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V  RHE  . It also features a high stability in 15,000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80 s  &#8208;1  at 0.9 V  RHE  .  Damjanovic  kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to predominate 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts  d  &#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.</dc:description>

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Proximity Aptasensing for Cell&#8208;Surface Real&#8208;Time Monitoring Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature,&#160; intact apoptotic cells release ATP as a signaling molecule to trigger the prompt phagocytic clearance, even at the earliest stage of apoptosis. Inspired by it, here we introduce a straightforward strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring the ATP exocytosis and drug&#8208;stimulated apoptosis in the cancer cell surroundings. Triplex&#8208;boosted G&#8208;quadruplexes (tb&#8208;G4s) responding to cell environmental factors (H  +  and K  +  ) are engineered to construct a DNA logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform for proximity ATP aptasensing on cell surface. It enables real&#8208;time monitoring cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP during chemotherapy drug stimulation, providing a sensitive approach for dynamically evaluating drug&#8208;induced apoptosis and therapeutic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new linkages is one of the most efficient strategies to enrich the family of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Particularly, functional linkages can endow COFs with additional tailored properties besides the building units, which thereby further    diversify COFs with desired functions  . Herein, for the first time, we developed a new arylamine linkage for the construction of COFs. Two new arylamine&#8208;linked COFs (AAm&#8208;TPB and AAm&#8208;Py) were prepared by condensing cost&#8208;effective  dimethyl succinyl succinate  (DMSS) with corresponding multitopic amines (TPB&#8208;NH  2  and Py&#8208;NH  2  ).  Due to the abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons  resembling that of polyaniline (PANI), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive polymer, the pseudocapacitive energy storage performance of AAm&#8208;TPB was further investigated. Remarkably, AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 271 F g  &#8722;1  with a three&#8208;electrode setup at a discharge rate of 1 A g  &#8722;1  , which represents one of the highest capacitances among the reported COF&#8208;based electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Current Status of MOF and COF Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. This Review reports on the milestones in MOF and COF research and gives a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. The major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications are also discussed.







Abstract
The amalgamation of different disciplines is at the heart of reticular chemistry and has broadened the boundaries of chemistry by opening up an infinite space of chemical composition, structure, and material properties. Reticular design has enabled the precise prediction of crystalline framework structures, tunability of chemical composition, incorporation of various functionalities onto the framework backbone, and as a consequence, fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) properties beyond that of any other material class. Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. Here, we wish to review the milestones in MOF and COF research and give a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. Finally, we briefly discuss the major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications.

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;Based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable spiropyran&#8208;based molecule (SPBM) containing mesogenic units with switchable color, photoluminescence and mesomorphism is synthesized. Therefore, programmable chromism and photoluminescence can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs, which own a tunable glass transition temperature (Tg) by converting the configuration of the crosslinked SPBMs to change the molecular order degree.







Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behavior of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via visible light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via UV light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given Tg of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable Tg can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.

         <title>Boosting Photoacoustic Effect via Intramolecular Motions Amplifying Thermal&#8208;to&#8208;Acoustic Conversion Efficiency for Adaptive Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging emerges as a promising technique for biomedical applications. The development of new strategies to boost PA conversion without depressing other properties (e.g., fluorescence) is highly desirable for multifunctional imaging but difficult to realize. Here, we report a new phenomenon that active intramolecular motions could promote PA signal by specifically increasing thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency. The compound with intense intramolecular motion exhibits amplified PA signal by elevating thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion, and the fluorescence also increases due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. The simultaneously high PA signal and fluorescence brightness of TPA&#8208;TQ3 NPs enable precise image&#8208;guided surgery. The preoperative fluorescence and PA imaging are capable of locating orthotopic breast tumor in a high&#8208;contrast manner, and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging delineates tiny residual tumors. This study highlights a new design guideline of intramolecular motion amplifying PA effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Selection in the Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Autocatalytic Reaction Networks that Produce Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical system is presented where polymerization of peptide monomers results in predominantly macrocyclic oligomers. Using this system, we make a clear demonstration of how the combination of autocatalysis, diversity of products, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions results in the selection of complex products.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction networks are instrumental for validating scenarios for the emergence of life on Earth and for synthesizing life de novo. Here, we demonstrate that dimeric thioesters of tripeptides with the general structure (Cys&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Gly&#8208;SEt)2 form strongly interconnected autocatalytic reaction networks that predominantly generate macrocyclic peptides up to 69 amino acids long. Some macrocycles of 6&#8211;12 amino acids were isolated from the product pool and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. We studied the autocatalytic formation of macrocycles in a flow reactor in the presence of acrylamide, whose conjugate addition to thiols served as a model &#8220;removal&#8221; reaction. These results indicate that even not template&#8208;assisted autocatalytic production combined with competing removal of molecular species in an open compartment could be a feasible route for selecting functional molecules during the pre&#8208;Darwinian stages of molecular evolution.

         <title>Localized Water&#8208;In&#8208;Salt Electrolyte for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt gel electrolyte with low&#8208;cost and high safety for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This electrolyte was fabricated by in situ gelling TEGDA monomer in an aqueous solution based on inexpensive LiNO3 salt and PD diluent. The as&#8208;developed Mo6S8 | LWIS gel | LMO batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance in with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.53&#8201;% % after 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes using super&#8208;concentrated organic lithium (Li) salts are of interest for aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high salt cost, high viscosity, poor wettability, and environmental hazards remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (LWIS) electrolyte based on low&#8208;cost lithium nitrate (LiNO3) salt and 1,5&#8208;pentanediol (PD) as inert diluent. The addition of PD maintains the solvation structure of the WIS electrolyte, improves the electrolyte stability via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with water and NO3&#8722; molecules, and reduces the total salt concentration. By in situ gelling the LWIS electrolyte with tetraethylene glycol diacrylate (TEGDA) monomer, the electrolyte stability window can be further expanded to 3.0&#8197;V. The as&#8208;developed Mo6S8|LWIS gel electrolyte|LiMn2O4 (LMO) batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.53&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.

         <title>From Kinase Inhibitors to Multitarget Ligands as Powerful Drug Leads for Alzheimer's Disease using Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using different small molecules targeting protein kinases and BACE1 templated synthesis, we have obtained well&#8208;balanced multitarget compounds. They have three different biological activities and may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of complex diseases such as AD.







Abstract
Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.

         <title>Protonated Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of imine&#8208;linked COFs yields significant variations of their (opto)electronic properties and in a largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. This is attributed to an enhanced light absorption ability, charge separation efficiency, and hydrophilicity of imine&#8208;linked COFs upon protonation.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as an important class of organic semiconductors and photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)from water. To optimize their photocatalytic activity, typically the organic moieties constituting the frameworks are considered and the most suitable combinations of them are searched for. However, the effect of the covalent linkage between these moieties on the photocatalytic performance has rarely been studied. Herein, we demonstrate that donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type imine&#8208;linked COFs can produce hydrogen with a rate as high as 20.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, upon protonation of their imine linkages. A significant red&#8208;shift in light absorbance, largely improved charge separation efficiency, and an increase in hydrophilicity triggered by protonation of the Schiff&#8208;base moieties in the imine&#8208;linked COFs, are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance.

The origin is traced back to a small HOMO lobe to reduce the destabilizing Pauli repulsion, and a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable orbital overlap.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles (R&#8722;Y&#8722;X:&#8722;) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8722;X:&#8722;) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type reactivity&#8208;basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the &#945;&#8208;effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including O&#8208;, N&#8208; and S&#8208;based normal and &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an &#945;&#8208;nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show &#945;&#8208;effect: (i)&#8197;a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii)&#8197;a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no &#945;&#8208;effect or inverse &#945;&#8208;effect.

         <title>Controlling Polymer Molecular Weight Distribution through a Latent Mediator Strategy with Temporal Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust method for controlling polymer MWDs in controlled cationic polymerizations by combining a latent mediator strategy and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed living cationic polymerization mediated by cationic RAFT agent is reported. Various shapes and breadths of MWD curves were obtained by simply adjusting the external light source.







Abstract
Polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a key parameter of polymers. Here we present a robust method for controlling polymer MWD in controlled cationic polymerizations. A latent mediator strategy was designed and combined with temporal programming to regenerate mediators at different times during polymerization. Both the breadths and shapes of MWD curves were tuned easily by adjusting an external light source. Bimodal, trimodal, and tetramodal distributions were obtained, and the breadths could be varied from 1.06 to 2.09. Polymers with different MWDs prepared by this method had good chain end fidelity, which was demonstrated with successful chain&#8208;extension experiments. In addition, the introduction of temporal programming with a computer&#8208;controlled single chip for the light source opened an avenue for the use of artificial intelligence in polymer synthesis.

         <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of a reactive [Cu2(&#181;&#8208;OH)2] intermediate in Cu/TEMPO catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu  I  /TEMPO (TEMPO = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;  N  oxyl) catalyst systems are versatile catalysts for aerobic alcohol oxidation reactions to selectively yield aldehydes. However, several aspects of the mechanism are yet unresolved, mainly because of the lack of identification of any reactive intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a dinuclear [Cu  2  L1  2  ]  2+  complex  1  (  L1  = 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;  N  (propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)butan&#8208;2&#8208;amine), which in presence of TEMPO can couple the catalytic 4H  +  /4e  &#8208;  reduction of O  2  to water to the oxidation of benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The mechanisms of the O  2  &#8208;reduction and alcohol oxidation reactions have been clarified on the basis of the spectroscopic detection of the reactive intermediates in the gas and condensed phases, as well as by kinetic studies on each step in the catalytic cycles. Notably, a bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species  3  , which is generally considered as a sluggish oxidant and a product of catalyst decomposition, is shown to be a viable reactant in oxidation catalysis. Furthermore, a bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo)dicopper(III) species  2  is identified as a precursor to  3  . A variety of spectroscopic methods (UV&#8211;vis absorption, infrared (IR), resonance Raman (rRaman) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)) coupled with advanced theoretical calculations has been applied for the unambiguous assignment of the geometric and electronic structures of  2  and  3  . The present study provides deep mechanistic insight into the aerobic oxidation of alcohols that should serve as a valuable foundation for ongoing efforts dedicated towards the understanding of transition metal catalysts involving redox&#8208;active organic cocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorophyll and heme are among the &#8216;pigments of life&#8217;, tetrapyrrolic structures, without which life on Earth would not be possible. Their catabolites, the phyllobilins and the bilins, respectively, share not only structural features, but also a similar story: Long considered waste products of detoxification processes, important bioactivities for both classes have now been demonstrated. For phyllobilins, however, research on physiological roles is sparse. Here, we introduce actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton, as the first discovered target of phyllobilins and as a novel target of bilins. We demonstrate the inhibition of actin dynamics  in vitro  and effects on actin and related processes in cancer cells. A direct interaction with G&#8208;actin is shown by  in silico  studies and confirmed by affinity chromatography. Our findings open a new chapter in bioactivities of tetrapyrroles &#8208; especially phyllobilins &#8208; for which they form the basis for broad implications in plant science, ecology, and physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a New Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8208;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10 membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12) MR pore in the  b  direction is a 10MR pore with long 12MR stretches forming 30 &#197;&#160; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10MR pores are fused, meaning that the&#160; separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally,&#160;&#160; connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a  Q  3  ). These fused pores are thus decorated&#160; by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an&#160; otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous&#160; 12&#215;12&#215;12 MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through  Q  3  producing a&#160; second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10 MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated&#160; yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tetraphenylethene Anion Receptors: Anion&#8208;Induced Emissive Aggregates and Photoswitchable Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding (XB) tetraphenylethene (TPE) based anion receptors are reported. The receptors exhibit a remarkable anion&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on luminescence response, in which halogen bonding anion interactions drive the formation of emissive nanoscale aggregates. Disubstituted XB TPE derivatives function as photoswitchable anion receptors, in which modulation of photostationary states is intimately related to anion affinity.







Abstract
A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported. 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulators that can be specifically activated by acidic tumor microenvironment to release immunomodulator and enhance tumor penetration are developed for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomedicine can regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumors and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes showed molecular&#8208;conformation&#8208;guided chiral hexagonal supramolecular packing and formed various helical nanoarchitectures, including unprecedented superhelices with molecular rigidity and assembly&#8208;boosted chiroptical performance.







Abstract
Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer&#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V&#8208;shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation Improves the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst improves the ethylene selectivity compared with a coated Pd monometallic catalyst. The intrinsic activity is preserved and is approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga2O3&#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H2 activation than that of Pd1Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Supported Lipid Monolayers using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free and non&#8208;destructive chemical and structural imaging of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111) is demonstrated with a spatial resolution of &#8776;20&#8197;nm using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for the first time. Ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and spatial resolution of TERS allows reproducible hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder within DPPC monolayers.







Abstract
Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8208;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile one&#8208;pot synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires breaks through the limitation of nanoelectrode materials to facilely construct high&#8208;performance single nanowire electrodes. Concurrently with excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and antifouling properties, the nanowire electrodes show great superiority in real&#8208;time monitoring of biological molecules and unraveling the relevant signaling pathway inside single living cells.







Abstract
A strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes is proposed. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8211;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8211;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells.

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites improves the crystallization process. Fluoride anions selectively coordinate and remove SnIV and affect the colloidal properties in solution. This study describes the working mechanism of SnF2 and highlights the importance of solution chemistry for controlling crystallization and SnII oxidation in tin halide perovskites.







Abstract
Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of SnII to SnIV. Most of reported strategies employ SnF2 in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent SnIV formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR analysis of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for SnIV over SnII, selectively complexing it as SnF4. Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF4 than SnI4 to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of SnIV in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large band gap and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) effect are two valuable but contradictory parameters, which are difficult to balance in one infrared (IR) NLO material. Herein, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal diamond&#8208;like (DL) IR NLO material Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  , presenting a honeycomb&#8208;like 3D framework constructed by 6&#8208;membered LiS  4  rings and GeMgS  6  zigzag chains, was rationally designed and synthesized. The introduction of rigid alkali metal and alkaline&#8208;earth metal LiS  4  and MgS  4  tetrahedra effectively broadens the band gap of DL compound to 4.12 eV (the largest one in the reported quaternary metal chalcogenides), generating a high laser damage threshold of 7 &#215; AgGaS  2  at 1064 nm. Furthermore, Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  displays a suitable SHG response (0.7 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) with a type I phase&#8208;matching behavior. The results indicate that Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  is a promising IR NLO material for the high&#8208;power laser application and it provides an insight into the design of new DL compound with outstanding IR NLO performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable site&#8208;specific functionalization of DNA origami with polynucleotide brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized origami nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8208;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C  (&#947;)  bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy group, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the Pauli principle, the spin arrangements on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the spin of the shifted electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the  exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity  via the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Chalcogen Bonding and Halogen Bonding Sigma&#8208;Hole Donor Atom Potency and Selectivity for Halide Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (  3&#183;ChB  ), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable production of benzylamines from lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C  &#945;  &#8208;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C  &#946;  &#8208;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and that secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of pseudo&#8208;natural product design and formal natural product ring distortion yields stereochemically and biologically diverse pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally complex and diverse natural products (NPs) display diverse biological activities and inspire the synthesis of new bioactive compound classes. We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combination of the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) whose different scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Cheminformatic analysis and morphological profiling in the cell painting assay revealed that the resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids are both chemically and biologically diverse, and that biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment. Biological investigation of the compound collection led to the discovery of a novel chemotype inhibiting Hedgehog&#8208;dependent osteoblast differentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with an undesirable heating damage to normal organs nearby due to its high temperature (&gt;50  o  C) for available tumor ablation. Achieving PTT strategies at a relatively low temperature therefore demonstrates tremendous value to clinic. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4, 4'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of APACPs are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of Hsp90&#945; for reducing thermal&#8208;resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT. This strategy provides a promising method for gene editing targeting tumor microenvironments, and opens a possibility to improve the therapeutic effect and minimize the side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly System for the Construction of a Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a promising avenue to treat and eradicate cancer. However, the significantly different physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and drug molecules hinder the potential direct integration of these two agents into a single particle, limiting the construction of an ideal delivery system to achieve synergistic antitumor effectiveness. Herein, we developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. Therefore, more drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid&#8208;based drug formulation, facilitating future development of drug&#8208;delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Tolerant Covalent Organic Framework Electrolyte with Holistically Oriented Channels for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window and high mechanical strength is the key to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently attracted considerable interests as promising SSEs mainly due to their highly tunable molecular structures and ideally well&#8208;ordered ion migration channels. Herein, we design and synthesize flexible high&#8208;voltage tolerant COF SSE films with holistically oriented channel structure to enable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811) for the first time. By rationally introducing lithium&#8208;philic groups and electrochemical stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkage, the as&#8208;prepared COFs demonstrated large bandgap with ultralow HOMO value (&#8211;6.2 eV under vacuum) and the highest oxidative stability up to 5.6 V (versus Li  +  /Li) among all the COF SSEs. Upon convenient mechanical assembly under pre&#8208;heat treatment, the obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5 &#215; 10  &#8211;4  S cm  &#8211;1  at 60 &#176;C, and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young&#8217;s modulus of 10.5 GPa. The lithium ions transmission in this COF SSE was revealed to exhibit directional hopping paths and fast drift velocity by molecular dynamic simulations. With such multiple features, we employed this COF SSE film to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries with NMC811 cathode, which demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400 cycles, high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%) and could also withstand abuse test such as folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolution of Li deposition vs intercalation of graphite anodes in lithium ion batteries &#8208; an in situ electron paramagnetic resonance study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plating of lithium on a graphite anode is the main barrier to fast charging of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in addition to causing serious capacity fade and safety issues. Here, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) electrochemical spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Our results indicate that classical &#8216;over&#8208;charging&#8217; (normally associated with potentials &#8804; 0 V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04 V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate lowered to 0.04 mV s&#8208;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by the vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, which is attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer, with higher ionic conductivity. Finally a safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05 V for the graphite anode is suggested for high rate cycling, which is confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Advection&#8208;enhanced kinetics in microtiter plates for improved surface assay quantitation and multiplexing capabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface assays such as ELISA are pervasive in clinics and research and predominantly standardized in microtiter plates (MTP). MTPs provide many advantages but are often detrimental to surface assay efficiency due to inherent mass transport limitations. Microscale flows can overcome these and largely improve assay kinetics. However, the disruptive nature of microfluidics with existing labware and protocols has narrowed its transformative potential. We present WellProbe, a novel microfluidic concept compatible with MTPs. With it, we show that immunoassays become more sensitive at low concentrations (up to 9&#215; signal improvement in 12x less time), richer in information with 3&#8208;4 different kinetic conditions, and can be used to estimate kinetic parameters, minimize washing steps and non&#8208;specific binding, and identify compromised results. We further multiplex single&#8208;well assays combining WellProbe&#8217;s kinetic regions with tailored microarrays. Finally, we demonstrate our system in a context of immunoglobulin subclass evaluation, increasingly regarded as clinically relevant.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8216;synthetic antibody&#8217; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer&#8208;based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8216;best&#8217; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis A Virus Cell Receptor&#8208;1 protein, also known as KIM&#8208;1 and TIM&#8208;1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane using Stable Solid&#8208;Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient and direct conversion of methane under mild conditions is of great significance to the innovation of the chemical industry. However, the efficiency and lifetime of most catalysts remain too far from the practical requirement, since it is difficult to break the first C&#8208;H bond of methane as well as to suppress the following complete dehydrogenation (or overoxidation) and the resulting carbonaceous deposition (or CO  2  ). Here, we report that wurtzite GaN:ZnO solid solutions exhibit unique and unprecedented photocatalytic performances for the nonoxidative coupling of methane at room temperature, exclusively generating ethane with nearly stoichiometric H  2  . High conversion rate (&gt; 330 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  ), long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 70 h), and superior coke&#8208;resistance were achieved. At 293 K, the methane conversion exceeds 7%, comparable to the equilibrium conversion of thermal catalysis at 910 K. Mechanism studies revealed that the N&#8208;Zn  Ga  &#8208;O  N  units and the absence of acid sites of surface played crucial roles in reactivity and coke&#8208;resistance, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy and antagonism between allosteric and active&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, &#8216;conformation&#8208;selective&#8217; ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells&#160;and Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. Herein we report an efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed coupling of&#160;  N  &#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of &#160;an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of&#160;  N  &#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. More importantly,&#160;we successfully develop&#160; three fluorophore&#8208;tagged Rh(III)&#8208;based fluorogenic probes (coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes,&#160;  CEPs  ) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the probes,&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;exhibited the&#160; highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52 ppb in air. Furthermore,&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;was &#160;successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and&#160;  Arabidopsis  &#160;thaliana  &#160;plants. These results indicated that&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unprecedented, efficient nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay for the remote cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of  &#946;  &#8208;bromo&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;benzylamino acid esters with aryl bromides  via  1,4&#8208;aryl migration/arylation cascades.  &#946;  &#8208;Bromo&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;benzylamino acid esters are considered as unique molecular scaffolds allowing for the aryl migration reactions, which are conceptually novel variants for the radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement. This reaction enables the formation of two new C(sp  3  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bonds using a bench&#8208;stable Ni/bipyridine/Zn system featuring a broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity, which provides an effective platform for the remote aryl group migration and arylation of amino acid esters  via  redox&#8208;neutral C(sp  3  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond cleavage. Mechanistically, this cascade reaction is accomplished by combining two powerful catalytic cycles consisting of a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and radical 1,4&#8208;aryl migration through the generation of C(sp  3  )&#8208;centred radical intermediates from the homolysis of C(sp  3  )&#8208;Br bonds and the switching of the transient alkyl radical into a robust &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adjacent Atomic Platinum Site Enables Single&#8208;Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst of Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC with Fe&#8208;N4 and Pt&#8208;N4 dual atomic sites. The enhancement for the ORR activity is demonstrated by the modulation effect: Pt&#8208;N4 plays the role in modulating the Fe&#8208;N4 active center to optimize the ORR performance. The modulation effect is not effective for the enhancement of ORR performance in the systems of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC.







Abstract
The modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt&#8208;N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#916;E1/2=8&#8197;mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 systems.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Radical Conjugate Addition Reactions: An Expanding Toolkit for the Giese Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.







Abstract
Photomediated Giese reactions are at the forefront of radical chemistry, much like the classical tin&#8208;mediated Giese reactions were nearly forty years ago. With the global recognition of organometallic photocatalysts for the mild and tunable generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals, chemists have developed a torrent of strategies to form previously inaccessible radical intermediates that are capable of engaging in intermolecular conjugate addition reactions. This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.

         <title>Efficient Electroconversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by a Reconstructed Amino&#8208;Functionalized Indium&#8211;Organic Framework Electrocatalyst</title>

The amino&#8208;functionalized reconstructed indium&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst demonstrates a high activity for carbon dioxide electroconversion to formate in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.







Abstract
We report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing one oxygen by one sulfur per monomer converts native oligonucleotides that cannot enter cells into cell&#8208;penetrating oligophosphorothioates. The reason for this is thiol&#8208;mediated uptake: dynamic covalent exchange with cellular thiols and disulfides that can be inhibited and activated according to the principles of dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom. They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA. Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials. However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown. Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake. The transient adaptive network produced by dynamic covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action. Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.

         <title>Rationalizing the Unprecedented Stereochemistry of an Enzymatic Nitrile Synthesis through a Combined Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.







Abstract
In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a smaller cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme, with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe was utilized.

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning dispersity and molecular weight distribution shape significantly impacts polymer properties. Herein, we report a straight&#8208;forward approach, wherein blending just two polymers allows for unrivalled precision in tuning molecular weight distributions.







Abstract
The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &#272; and one of low &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.

         <title>Principles of Water Electrolysis and Recent Progress in Cobalt&#8208;, Nickel&#8208;, and Iron&#8208;Based Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review describes the basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and significant criteria for the development of new catalysts. Recent advances in catalysts based on Co, Ni, and Fe oxides are described, and a brief perspective is given on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Water electrolysis that results in green hydrogen is the key process towards a circular economy. The supply of sustainable electricity and availability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are the main bottlenecks of the process for large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen. A broad range of OER electrocatalysts have been explored to decrease the overpotential and boost the kinetics of this sluggish half&#8208;reaction. Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been considered to be potential candidates to replace noble metals due to their tunable 3d electron configuration and spin state, versatility in terms of crystal and electronic structures, as well as abundance in nature. This Review provides some basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of OER, and significant criteria for the development of the catalysts. It provides also some insights on recent advances of Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based oxides and a brief perspective on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.

         <title>Tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine Backbone for Highly Efficient Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Completely Horizontal Molecular Orientation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The expansion of TBPZ acceptor plane well&#8208;controlled the excited states involving 1CT, 3CT and 3LE states, which enhances the kRISC by remarkably shorting of the &#964;d and induced a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM. Consequently, PQ3 displayed an orange red EL max at 586&#8197;nm, PLQY of ca. 83&#8201;%, kRISC of 8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#964;d of 2.7&#8197;&#956;s, S values of &#8722;0.49, and deliver high EQE of 27.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.

         <title>Single&#8208;cell Imaging of m6A modified RNA Using m6A&#8208;specific In Situ Hybridization mediated Proximity Ligation Assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA)</title>

         <dc:description>N  6  &#8208;methyladenosine (m  6  A) modification &#8208; the most prevalent mammalian RNA internal modification &#8208; plays key regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism. Current approaches for m  6  A modified RNA analysis limit at bulk&#8208;population level, resulting in a loss of spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. Here we proposed a m  6  A&#8208;specific  in situ  hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA) for cellular imaging of m  6  A RNA, allowing to identify m  6  A modification at specific location in RNAs and image m  6  A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution. Using m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA, we investigated the m  6  A level and subcellular location of HSP70 RNA103&#8208;m  6  A in each cell in response to heat shock, and found an increased m  6  A modified ratio and an increased distribution ratio in cytoplasm under heat shock stress. m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA can serve in the study of m  6  A RNA in single&#8208;cell for deciphering epitranscriptomic mechanisms and assisting clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthodithiophene Diimide&#8208;Based Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanopillar Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclo&#8208;naphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C&#8208;NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n&#8208;type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;&#8208;positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;promoted macrocyclization route. Thiophene&#8208;thiophene junction in [4]C&#8208;NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs with both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C60.&#160; Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules with impressive characteristics present the great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for development of multifunctional organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low&#8208;cost and readily available reagent. This light&#8208;mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers an C&#8722;O bond fragmentation. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF  3  CO radical under photoredox&#160; conditions. Remarkably, the trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simple changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of small&#8208;molecule drugs and common pharmacophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetrical sp2&#8208;sp3 Disilenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disilenes with differently coordinated silicon atoms are not known. Here, we have shown the high yield synthesis of a range of disilenes (  2  &#8208;  4  and  6  ) upon reaction of a hypersilyl silylene PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  SiSi(SiMe  3  )  3  (  1  ) with aliphatic chlorophosphines. The most striking characteristic of these disilenes is the presence of two differently coordinated Si atoms (one is three&#8208;coordinated, the other four&#8208;coordinated). The analogous reaction with Ph  2  PCl did not afford the desired disilene, but, surprisingly, led to the first tetraphosphinosilane (  8  ). DFT calculations were performed to understand the bonding in disilenes and differences in reactivity of the complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases and Li&#8208;ion Flux/Solvation with Qua&#8208;functional Heptafluorobutyric Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety and electrochemical performance of rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are primarily influenced by the additives in the organic liquid electrolytes. However, multi&#8208;functional additives are still rarely reported. Herein, we proposed heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) as a qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reduction/oxidation decomposition of the fluorine&#8208;rich HFA facilitate uniform inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, which enables stable lithium plating during charge and suppresses the dissolution of transition&#8208;metal ions. Moreover, HFA optimizes the Li&#8208;ion solvation for stable Li plating/stripping and serves as the surfactant to enhance the wettability of the separator by the electrolyte to increase Li&#8208;ion flux. The symmetric Li||Li cell with 1.0 wt% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340 h at 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 while the Li||NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250 cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15C.</dc:description>

The symmetric Li||Li cell with 1.0 wt% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340 h at 1.0 mA cm-2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2 while the Li||NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250 cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying Structure&#8211;Selectivity Correlations in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2: A Comparison of Well&#8208;Ordered Atomically Clean and Chemically Etched Copper Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces affect their CO2RR selectivity. Clean, flat, atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; but these actually favor production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. Structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.







Abstract
The identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to specific chemical products is elusive, owing in part to insufficient data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO2RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; however, these were found experimentally to favor the production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example by electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, are significant amounts of hydrocarbons generated. These results show that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy Using Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed highly selective C1&#8722;C8 bond cleavage of BCBs with the insertion of alkynes was achieved by the assistance of a removable blocking group. This method provided an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical approach to structurally important 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediols under pH&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.

         <title>Photo Click Reaction of Acylsilanes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photoreaction occurs under mild conditions mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals. The potential of the method is documented by the successful coupling of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids and by the conjugation of polymers.







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415&#8197;nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8208;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.

         <title>Water Oxidation under Modal Ultrastrong Coupling Conditions Using Gold/Silver Alloy Nanoparticles and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricated a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles, a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal ultrastrong coupling conditions and applied the photoanode to a water oxidation reaction. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% of maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency, obtained at 580&#8197;nm. These results derive from the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency owing to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement.







Abstract
We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520&#8197;meV, which can be categorized into the ultrastrong coupling regime. We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE), obtained at 580&#8197;nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1&#8201;%. These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed, with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70&#8201;% for O2 evolution.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO  2  is a promising route to provide sustainable fuels. The performance is still unsatisfactory mainly due to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO  2  is reduced to methanol with 100% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9% (&#955; = 420 nm) is 300% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT can be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a unique strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous enhancement of magnetic resonance signals using a RASER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance is usually drastically limited by its intrinsically low sensitivity: Only a few spins contribute to the overall signal. To overcome this limitation, hyperpolarization methods were developed that increase signals several times beyond the normal/thermally polarized signals. The ideal case would be a universal approach that can signal enhance the complete sample of interest in solution to increase detection sensitivity. Here, we introduce the combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal. We demonstrate that this is not only possible for solvent molecules but also for an amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient site&#8208;selective desymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;dienes is reported. This protocol allows rapid access to a wide range of chiral allylic alcohols and amides bearing two vicinal chiral centers adjacent to the alkene. The utility of this method is further highlighted by the synthesis of the alkyl side chain of zaragozic acid&#8197;A and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;invictolide.







Abstract
The control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes via iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of meso dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxy oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products zaragozic acid&#8197;A and (+)&#8208;invictolide.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenophene end&#8208;capped asymmetric heteroheptacene core is used to construct an efficient nonfullerene acceptor (MQ6) which shows increased carrier transport due to the enhanced O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se intramolecular noncovalent interaction as well as the increased dipole moment. MQ6 exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 16.39&#8201;% when blended with a wide band gap copolymer.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5, MQ6) are synthesized using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores with selenophene heterocycles. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se compared to that of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64&#8201;% compared to MQ3, which shows a PCE of 13.51&#8201;%. Based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows an improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. MQ6 exhibits a PCE of 16.39&#8201;% with a VOC of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a JSC of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes integrated with perylene diimide is developed. The macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The porous supramolecular structures display micropore characteristics and charge transporting properties.







Abstract
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral ortho&#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8211;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. A moderate electron mobility of 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Metathesis&#8208;Based Approach to the Synthesis of the Anti&#8208;Malarial Macrodiolide Samroiyotmycin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forging of the 20&#8208;membered macrocylic core of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A can be readily achieved by combining a Mo&#8208;catalysed one&#8208;pot alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis ring&#8208;closing metathesis of bisalkyne building blocks and Ru&#8208;catalysed hydrometallation chemistry. These key transformations have enabled the first total synthesis of this anti&#8208;malarial C2&#8208;symmetric macrodiolide.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis&#8211;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8211;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].

These key transformations have enabled the first total synthesis of this anti-malarial &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric macrodiolide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric 20-membered anti-malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment-assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#246;llkopf-type condensation on a substituted &#946;-lactone and an ambitious late-stage one-pot alkyne cross metathesis&#8211;ring-closing metathesis (ACM&#8211;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E-alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free&#8208;Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine&#8208;Based Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual&#8208;mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and peroxide&#8208;free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain&#8208;growth modes.







Abstract
Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization&#8208;initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free&#8208;radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical&#8208;propagation process. The benefit of this dual&#8208;mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes.

         <title>Monitoring Metabolites Using an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive Polymer Dot and a Metabolite&#8208;Specific Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabolite biosensor is developed by integrating an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dot and a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme. Metabolite concentration can be measured ratiometrically with high sensitivity and specificity. Phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma is shown for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantitation of other disease&#8208;related metabolites, and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphone imaging.







Abstract
We introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627&#8197;nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458&#8197;nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8208;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8208;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <dc:description>
A direct &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.







Abstract
A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.

Abstract

         <title>Selective Bond Cleavage in RAFT Agents Promoted by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Attachment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron attachment leads to the efficient dissociation of carbonothioylsulfanyl molecules which are relevant for Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.







Abstract
Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (.CH3 in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.

We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical polymerization with reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well-defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side-reactions and high spatio-temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low-energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low-energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Lysozyme&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy Against Resistant Bacteria based on an Intelligent Upconversion Nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohybrid UCMB&#8208;LYZ&#8208;HP was designed with features of intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive release of lysozyme and NIR&#8208;triggered high production of 1O2. By synergistically combining the enzymatic and photodynamic effect, the nanohybrid exhibited an extraordinary antibacterial capacity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue infections caused by resistant bacteria.







Abstract
The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Now we designed a bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus. These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.

         <title>Intracellular Protein&#8211;Drug Interactions Probed by Direct Mass Spectrometry of Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells, based on our direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. We demonstrate label&#8208;free analysis of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and measurement of the binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples.







Abstract
Understanding protein&#8211;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8211;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.

         <title>Revision of the Unstable Picrotoxinin Hydrolysis Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of picrotoxinin (PXN), which is a plant metabolite that is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling, in weakly alkaline media gives an unstable hydrolysis intermediate that was initially assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. This assignment however has been shown to be in error on the basis of the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrolysis product in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.







Abstract
The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.

         <title>A Borondifluoride&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Photothermal Agent with an 80% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Photothermal Therapy in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) that absorb in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) window are highly desirable in photothermal therapy for their good biocompatibility and deeper tissue penetration. However, the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that molecular engineering of BF2 complex via strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation and increasing the intramolecular motions is an efficient strategy to achieve NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs with high photothermal performance. Based on this strategy, a BF2 complex, BAF4, was designed and synthesized. BAF4 exhibits an intense absorption maximum at 1000 nm and negligible fluorescence. Notably, the nanoparticles of BAF4 achieve a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80% under 1064 nm laser irradiation (0.75 W cm&#8208;2). In vitro and in vivo studies reveal the great potential of BAF4 nanoparticles in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the undesired Zn corrosion and Zn dendrite formation in aqueous electrolyte, most of the reported excellent performance of aqueous Zn batteries is achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6 %) in anode and low mass&#8208;loading (&lt;3 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) in cathode. Herein, we propose a new organic electrolyte for Zn batteries, which contains a zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn&#8208;TFMS) salt and a mixture solvent of propylene carbonate (PC) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). We demonstrate that this electrolyte with optimized PC/TEP ratio not only exhibits high ionic conductivity and wide stable potential window, but also facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping. Especially, the TEP solvent endows the electrolyte non&#8208;flammability. Finally, a 2 V Zn//polytriphenylamine composite (PTPAn) battery is fabricated by using the optimized electrolyte, which shows high rate and a long&#8208;life (2,400 cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading (16 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) of PTPAn in cathode and with a high utilization of Zn anode (3.5 %).</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective, Scalable Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic O&#8208;Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of aryl&#8208;alkyl ether bonds through cross coupling of alcohols with aryl halides represents a useful strategic departure from classical S  N  2 methods. Numerous tactics relying on Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g. Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e&#8208;etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.</dc:description>

Numerous tactics relying on Pd-, Cu-, and Ni-based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni-catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g. Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e-etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding&#160;the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates towards electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we combine experimental evidence and theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co  3+  and Co  4+  species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co  3+  is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co  4+  is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As results, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>s&#8208;Indacene is a classical nonalternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Here, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine via a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diarylacethylenes followed by a hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, which manifests in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. Compared to the parent&#160;s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability due to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables the fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8211;B bond of a di(  o  &#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a  cis  &#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8211;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a 'retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift', which can be considered as an  anti  &#8208;&#120573;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Counterion Control of t&#8208;BuO&#8208;Mediated Single Electron Transfer to Nitrostilbenes to Construct N&#8208;Hydroxyindoles or Oxindoles</title>

tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks divergent reactivity embedded in nitrostilbenes to construct N&#8208;hydroxyindoles or oxindoles depending on whether sodium or potassium is the counterion.







Abstract
tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks new reactivity patterns embedded in nitroarenes. Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium tert&#8208;butoxide was found to produce N&#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or N&#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chiral mesostructured BiOBr film exhibiting a chirality&#8208;dependent circularly polarized colour response due to the structural&#8208;handedness matching and synergistic effect of multiple optical activities.







Abstract
Achieving strong and broadband circularly polarized colour responses in chiral inorganic materials is challenging. Here, we fabricated chiral mesostructured bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) films (CMBFs) via hydrothermal growth using chiral sugar alcohols as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. The layered slabs of BiOBr crystals with weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangements of fine size. Three levels of chirality exist in the CMBFs: primary, helical distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary, helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and tertiary, chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range of 350&#8211;2500&#8197;nm with an anisotropic factor of up to 0.99, which led to a significant chirality&#8208;dependent colour response to circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the result of enhanced resonance due to structural&#8208;handedness matching and the synergistic effect of multiple OAs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.







Abstract
We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

     alt="Nickel-Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;-Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;-alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose a nickel-catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;-alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron-rich and electron-deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonation towards pyrrole and indole polycyclic scaffolds featuring five&#8208;, six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings, with tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The process can be coupled with the desymmetrization of prochiral centers to obtain pyrrole&#8208; and indole&#8208;fused scaffolds with either vicinal or skipped stereocenters. DFT studies shed light on the mechanism and key stereodetermining factors.







Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Covalent Organic Framework Staggered Stacking Nanosheet Membrane for CO2&#8208;Selective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of lamellar COFs were exfoliated into discrete nanosheets with large aspect&#8208;ratios. The nanosheets were assembled into ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional membranes with staggered stacking patterns, respectively. Taking advantage of narrowed pore size and CO2&#8208;philic adsorption, these single&#8208;phase COF nanosheet membranes were characterized by superior CO2/H2 separation performances.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light&#8208;weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely&#8208;tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single&#8208;phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro&#8208;structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2&#8208;philic separation performances, among which TpPa&#8208;2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2/H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298&#8197;K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

         <title>The Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction Directing the Design of Single Atomic Site Catalysts: Achieving High Efficiency Towards Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) is closely related to the electronic structure of active sites, which determines the catalytic activity. We put forward a method of designing the EMSI of single&#8208;atomic site catalysts (SACs) to achieve high efficiency. The SACs achieve a lower overpotential and higher mass activity than any other SACs towards hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the benefits of this method.







Abstract
It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22&#8197;mV and 86&#8197;mV at the at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 (vs. 192.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (&#8776;20&#8201;% electricity consuming decrease at 2&#8197;kA&#8201;m&#8722;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrid catalyst with abundant Zn defects exhibits an outstanding OER performance, demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. DFT calculations reveal that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defects can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve intrinsic catalytic performance. This study provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterojunctions with defects.







Abstract
Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve activity of metal sulfide. However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

         <title>Engineering Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase To Enable the Highly selective Decarboxylation of trans Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high risk of heart disease caused by the intake of  trans  fatty acids, a method to eliminate  trans  fatty acids from foods has become a critical issue. Herein, we engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from  Chlorella variabilis  (  Cv  FAP) to selectively catalyze the decarboxylation of  trans  fatty acids to yield readily&#8208;removed hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, while  cis  fatty acids remained unchanged. An efficient protein engineering based on FRISM strategy was implemented to intensify the electronic interaction between the residues and the double bond of the substrate that stabilized the binding of elaidic acid in the channel. For the model compounds, oleic acid and elaidic acid, the best mutant, V453E, showed a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold improvement in the  trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis  (  ToC  ) selectivity compared with wild type (WT). As the first report of the direct biocatalytic decarboxylation resolution of  trans  /  cis  fatty acids, this work offers a safe, facile, and eco&#8208;friendly process to eliminate  trans  fatty acids from edible oils.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring ultrafast photoswitching pathways in RbMnFe Prussian Blue Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study by femtosecond optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in the RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Previous studies evidenced the local nature of the photoinduced Mn  III  Fe  II  &#8208;&#8208;&gt; Mn  II  Fe  III  process, occurring within less than 1 ps. Here we show experimentally that two photoswitching pathways exist, depending on the excitation pump wavelength, which is confirmed by band structure calculations. Photoexcitation of a spins corresponds to the Mn(d&#8208;d) band, which drives reverse Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion through the population of antibonding Mn&#8208;N orbitals, and induces CT within ~190 fs. The process launches coherent lattice torsion during the self&#8208;trapping of the CT small&#8208;polaron. Photoexcitation of b spins drives intervalence Fe&#8208;&#8208;&gt;Mn CT towards non&#8208;bonding states and results in a slower dynamic.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal&#8208;size&#8208;induced band gap tuning in perovskite films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive picture explaining the effect of the crystal size in metal halide perovskite films on their opto&#8208;electronic characteristics is currently lacking. We report that perovskite nanocrystallites exhibit a wider band gap due to concurrent quantum confinement and size dependent structural effects, with the latter being remarkably distinct and attributed to the perturbation from the surface of the nanocrystallites affecting the structure of their core. This phenomenon might assist in the photo&#8208;induced charge separation within the perovskite in devices employing mesoporous layers as they restrict the size of nanocrystallites present in them. We demonstrate that the crystal size effect is widely applicable as it is ubiquitous in different compositions and deposition methods employed in the fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the art perovskite solar cells. This effect is a convenient and effective way to tune the band gap of perovskites, thus shedding light on the path forward for the design of perovskite devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Opto&#8208;electrochemical Dissolution Reveals Coccolith Calcium Carbonate Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coccoliths are plates of biogenic calcium carbonate secreted by calcifying marine phytoplankton; annually these phytoplankton are responsible for exporting &gt;1 billion tonnes (10  15  g) of calcite to the deep ocean. Rapid and reliable methods for assessing the degree of calcification are technically challenging because the coccoliths are micron sized and contain picograms (pg) of calcite. Here we pioneer an opto&#8208;eletrochemical acid titration of individual coccoliths which allows 3D reconstruction of each individual coccolith via in situ optical imaging enabling direct inference of the coccolith mass. Coccolith mass ranging from 2 to 400 pg are reported herein, evidencing both inter&#8208;  and  intra&#8208;species variation over four different species. We foresee this scientific breakthrough, which is independent of knowledge regarding the species and calibration&#8208;free, will allow continuous monitoring and reporting of the degree of coccolith calcification in the changing marine environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesized catalyst towards acidic oxygen reduction by deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells. However, many aspects of the catalytic process are still uncertain, especially the large difference in activity in acidic and alkaline media. Thus, the design and synthesis of model catalysts to determine the active centres and the inactivation mechanism are urgently needed. In this work, we reported a pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesis route to fabricate a catalyst (CPF&#8208;Fe@NG) for acidic oxygen reduction. By introducing a deprotonation process, we extended the ORR (Oxygen Reduction Reaction) activity from alkaline to acidic conditions. CPF&#8208;Fe@NG demonstrated outstanding performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 853 mV (vs. RHE) and good stability after 10000 cycles in 1 M HClO4  . The pyrolysis&#8208;free route could also be used to assemble fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 126 mW cm&#8208;2  . Our findings offer new insights into the ORR process to optimize catalysts for both mechanistic studies and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A couple of fluorescent enantiomers, which are suitable for the emitters of high&#8208;efficiency TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs, have been developed. The enantiomers show configurational stability, high PLQY of 98%, large k  r  of 7.8&#215;10  7  s  &#8208;1  , and intense CPL activities with |g  lum  | values of about 2.5 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  . Notably, by using matchable TADF sensitizer, the enantiomers were then exploited as emitter to fabricate CP&#8208;OLEDs. The TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs not only show mirror&#8208;image CPEL activities with g  EL  values of +1.8&#215;10  &#8208;3  and &#8208;1.4&#215;10  &#8208;3  , but also display fast start&#8208;up featuring with low V  T  of 3.0 V as well as driving voltage of 4.84 V at 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  . Meaningfully, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices show high EQE  max  of 21.5% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQEs are 21.2% and 15.3% at 1000 and 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  , respectively. The results are even better than those of CP&#8208;TADF emitters, which provides a promising perspective to break through the EL efficiency limit of CP&#8208;FL emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Matching Selectivity and Solution Structure of Organic&#8208;Metal Hybrid to Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sequence&#8208;dependent DNA secondary structures possess structure polymorphism. To date, studies on&#160;regulated ligands mainly focus on individual DNA secondary topologies, while lack focus on quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids (QDHs). Here, we design an organic&#8208;metal hybrid ligand  L  1  Pt(dien)  , which matches and selectively binds one type of QDHs with lateral duplex stem&#8208;loop (QLDH) with high affinity, while shows poor affinity for other QDHs and individual G4 or duplex DNA. The solution structure of QLDH MYT1L&#8722;  L  1  Pt(dien)  complex was determined by NMR. The structure reveals that  L  1  Pt(dien)  presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, showing a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode. Our work provided guidance for spatial matching design of selectively targeting ligands to QDH structures.</dc:description>
