The complex non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure in the tetragonal space group  I&#8208;4  2  m  was solved by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a 6&#8208;component twin due to pseudocubic symmetry and further confirmed by high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The electron&#8208;precise composition of this clathrate yields narrow&#8208;gap  p  &#8208;type semiconductor with extraordinarily low thermal conductivity due to displacement or &#8220;rattling&#8221; of K cations inside oversized cages and as well as to twinning, staking faults and antiphase boundary defects.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Photoresponsive Molecular Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Amphiphilic molecules, comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and the intrinsic propensity to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous environment, sustain a fascinating spectrum of structures and functions ranging from biological membranes to ordinary soap. Facing the challenge to design responsive, adaptive, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in water, the incorporation of photoresponsive motifs in amphiphilic molecular structures offers ample opportunity to design supramolecular systems that enables functional responses in water in a non&#8208;invasive way using light. Here, we discuss the design of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles, their self&#8208;assembled structures in aqueous media and at air&#8208;water interfaces, and various approaches to arrive at adaptive and dynamic functions in isotropic and anisotropic systems, including motion at the air&#8208;water interface, foam formation, reversible nanoscale assembly, and artificial muscle function. Controlling the delicate interplay of structural design, self&#8208;assembling conditions and external stimuli, these responsive amphiphiles open several avenues towards application such as soft adaptive materials, controlled delivery or soft actuators, bridging a gap between artificial and natural dynamic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Super&#8208;resolution spatial proximity detection with proximity&#8208;PAINT</title>
      <dc:description>Visualizing the functional interactions of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids is key to understanding cellular life on the molecular scale. Spatial proximity is often used as a proxy for the direct interaction of biomolecules. However, current techniques to visualize spatial proximity are either limited by spatial resolution, dynamic range, or lack of single&#8208;molecule sensitivity. Here, we introduce Proximity&#8208;PAINT (pPAINT), a variation of the super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique DNA&#8208;PAINT. pPAINT uses a split&#8208;docking&#8208;site configuration to detect spatial proximity with high sensitivity, low false&#8208;positive rates, and tunable detection distances. We benchmark and optimize pPAINT using designer DNA nanostructures and demonstrate its cellular applicability by visualizing the spatial proximity of alpha&#8208; and beta&#8208;tubulin in microtubules using super&#8208;resolution detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Amine&#8208;Boranes as Transfer Hydrogenation and Hydrogenation Reagents: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>Transfer hydrogenation (TH) has historically been dominated by Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reactions. However, with growing interest in amine&#8208;boranes, not least ammonia&#8208;borane (H  3  N&#183;BH  3  ), as potential hydrogen storage materials, these compounds have also started to emerge as an alternative reagent in TH reactions. In this review we discuss recent literature into TH chemistry using H  3  N&#183;BH  3  and their analogues (amine&#8208;boranes and metal amidoboranes) as sacrificial hydrogen donors. By analyzing the mechanisms operating three distinct pathways were considered: (  i  ) classical TH, (  ii  ) non&#8208;classical TH, and (  iii  ) hydrogenation. Simple experimental mechanistic probes can be employed to distinguish which pathway is operating and computational analysis can corroborate or discount mechanisms including rationalizing selectivity observed under certain conditions. We find that the pathway in operation can be perturbed by changing the temperature, solvent, amine&#8208;borane or even the substrate used in the system, and subsequently assignment of the mechanism can become non&#8208;trivial. Therefore, by examining the mechanism of these reactions, we anticipate this will aid in future reaction development in the area of TH using amine&#8208;boranes.</dc:description>

      <title>Liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries and encapsulation&#8208;free flexible batteries enabled by in&#8208;situ constructed polymer electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>Zn batteries are usually considered as safe aqueous system promising for flexible batteries. On the other hand, any liquids, including water, being encapsulated in a deformable battery may result in potential troubles. Developing completely liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries needs high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs).  Here, we demonstrate the  in&#8208;situ  polymerized amorphous solid poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) electrolytes, which  shows high Zn ion conductivity of  19.6 mS  &#215;cm  &#8208;1  at room temperature, low interfacial impedance, highly reversible Zn plating/stripping over 1800 h cycles, uniform &amp; dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and non&#8208;dry properties.  The  in&#8208;plane  interdigital&#8208;structure device with electrolyte completely exposed to open atmosphere can be stably operated for over 30 days almost without weight loss and electrochemical performance decay. Furthermore, the sandwich&#8208;structure device can normally operate over 40 min under fire condition. Meanwhile, the interfacial impedance and the capacity using  in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed  SPEs retain almost unchanged after various bending tests, a key criterion for flexible/wearable devices. Our study demonstrates an approach for SSEs that fulfill the requirement of no liquid and mechanical robustness for practical solid&#8208;state Zn batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural basis for &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry and inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions with oligourea foldamers</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient optimization of a peptide lead into a drug candidate frequently needs further transformation to augment properties such as bioavailability. Among the different options, foldamers, sequence&#8208;based oligomers with precise folded conformation, have emerged as a promising technology. Here, we introduce oligourea foldamers to reduce the peptide character of inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI).

      <title>Turning on Zn 4s Electrons in a N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 Configuration to Stimulate Remarkable ORR Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Zn based single atom catalyst has been recently explored with distinguished stability, of which the fully occupied Zn  2+  3d  10  4s  2  electronic configuration is Fenton reaction inactive, but the catalytic activity is thus inferior.

We confirm both experimentally and theoretically that the unique N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 configuration is crucial, in which Zn  +  (3d  10  4s  1  ) can hold enough delocalized electrons to generate suitable binding strength for key reaction intermediates and promote the charge transfer between catalytic surface and ORR reactants. This exclusive effect is not found in the other transition metal counterparts such as M&#8208;B/N&#8208;C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). &#160;Consequently, the as obtained catalyst demonstrate impressive ORR activity, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability in both alkaline and acid media.

      <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aldol Reaction: Post&#8208;Aldol Stereochemistry Control and Formation of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers</title>
      <dc:description>The dominated approaches for asymmetric aldol reactions have primarily focused on the aldol carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming events. Here we postulate and develop a new catalytic strategy that seeks to modulate the reaction thermodynamics and control the product enantioselectivities via post&#8208;aldol processes. Specifically, a NHC catalyst is used to activate a masked enolate substrate (vinyl carbonate) to promote the aldol reaction in a non&#8208;enantioselective manner. This aldol event is subsequently followed by a dynamic kinetic resolution process that is mediated by the same (chiral) NHC catalyst without introducing any additional substance. This post&#8208;aldol process takes care of the enantioselectivity issues and drives the otherwise reversible aldol reaction toward a complete conversion. The acylated aldol products bearing quaternary/tetrasubstituted carbon stereogenic centers are formed in good yields and high optical purities.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantitative Protein Corona Composition and Dynamics on Carbon Nanotubes in Biological Environments</title>
      <dc:description>When nanoparticles enter biological environments, proteins adsorb to form the &#8220;protein corona&#8221; which causes significant changes in biodistribution and toxicity. Herein, we measure protein corona formation on DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs), a nanoparticle ideal for sensing and delivery, in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We characterize corona composition by mass spectrometry, revealing high&#8208;abundance corona proteins involved in lipid binding, complement activation, and coagulation. We investigate roles of electrostatic and entropic interactions driving selective corona formation. Lastly, we study real&#8208;time protein binding on ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs, obtaining agreement between enriched proteins binding strongly and depleted proteins binding marginally, while highlighting cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Knowledge of protein corona composition, formation mechanisms, and dynamics informs nanoparticle translation from  in vitro  design to  in vivo  application.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;voltage Rechargeable Alkali&#8208;acid Zn&#8208;PbO2 Hybrid Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable batteries have attracted tremendous research attentions owning to their advantages of safety, low cost and sustainability, while the limited electrochemical stability window (1.23 V) of water leads to their failure in competition with organic based lithium ion batteries. In this work, we report an alkali&#8208;acid Zn&#8208;PbO  2  hybrid battery by coupling alkaline Zn anode with acidic PbO  2  cathode, which show capability to deliver an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage (  V  oc  ) of 3.09 V and an operate voltage of 2.95 V at 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , thanks to the contribution from expanding the voltage window and electrochemical neutralization energy from the alkali&#8208;acid asymmetric&#8208;electrolyte hybrid cell. Attractively, the hybrid battery can potentially deliver a large area capacity over 2 mAh cm  &#8208;2  or a high energy density of 252.39 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and shows almost no fading in area capacity over 250 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. The highly desirable electrochemical properties signify that the hybrid alkali&#8208;acid Zn&#8208;PbO  2  battery, by virtue of mature technology of lead acid battery, may hold great promise in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning: The Future of Synthetic Chemistry?</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular machine learning is a research topic that has great potential to fundamentally change the way synthetic chemists operate. This Viewpoint provides an overview of possible chances for the entire field of chemistry, highlights problems/challenges and associated undesirable trends, and suggests sustainable developments and opportunities.







Abstract
During the last decade, modern machine learning has found its way into synthetic chemistry. Some long&#8208;standing challenges, such as computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP), have been successfully addressed, while other issues have barely been touched. This Viewpoint poses the question of whether current trends can persist in the long term and identifies factors that may lead to an (un)productive development. Thereby, specific risks of molecular machine learning (MML) are discussed. Furthermore, possible sustainable developments are suggested, such as explainable artificial intelligence (exAI) for synthetic chemistry. This Viewpoint will illuminate chances for possible newcomers and aims to guide the community into a discussion about current as well as future trends.

      <title>Shining New Light on Multifunctional Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>
The design principles in the synthesis of luminescent lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are the focus of this Review. Although a number of luminescent SMMs have been investigated in recent years, the majority address each component (magnetism and luminescence) in an isolated fashion. This Review highlights how their complementary nature opens the doors to some exciting applications.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are at the forefront of new technological advances in quantum information processing and spintronics. Despite the recent impressive breakthroughs in extending the magnetic blocking temperatures beyond liquid&#8208;nitrogen temperatures, significant challenges await in terms of integrating and addressing such compounds in devices. With this ultimate goal in mind, the design of multifunctional SMMs not only allows to imbue molecules of interest with specific properties that would allow for in&#8197;situ monitoring of the SMM operation in real time, but can also provide critical insights into our understanding of the magnetic behaviour. In this Review, we highlight how magnetism and luminescence can be harmoniously combined within single molecules to achieve these objectives. The key design principles to attain the simultaneous combination of photoluminescence and slow relaxation of the magnetization are discussed, along with an outlook on how such molecules could be beneficial for emerging next&#8208;generation spintronics devices.

      <title>Facile Dinitrogen and Dioxygen Cleavage by a Uranium(III) Complex: Cooperativity Between the Non&#8208;innocent Ligand and the Uranium Center</title>
      <dc:description>Activation of dinitrogen (N2  , 78%) and dioxygen (O2  , 21%) has fascinated chemists and biochemists for decades. The industrial conversion of N  2  to ammonia requires extremely high temperatures and pressure. Here we report the first example of N2  and O2  cleavage by a uranium complex, [N(CH2CH2NPiPr2)3U]2(TMEDA), under ambient conditions without an external reducing agent. The N2  triple bond breaking implies a U(III)&#8208;P(III) six&#8208;electron reduction. The hydrolysis of the N2  reduction product allows the formation of ammonia or nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compound. The interaction between U(III) and P(III) in this molecule allows an eight&#8208;electron reduction of two O2  molecules. This study establishes that the combination of uranium and a low&#8208;valent nonmetal is a promising strategy to achieve a full N2  and O2  cleavage under ambient conditions, which may aid the design of new system for small molecules activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Expedient Synthetic Identification of a Novel P&#8208;stereogenic Ligand Motif for the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Isotactic Polar Polypropylenes</title>
      <dc:description>The  iso  &#8208;specific statistical copolymerization of unprotected polar monomers with propylene still stands a as grand challenge in the field of polymer chemistry. Current research in the field is hampered as to date only a single natural product derived dimenthylphosphine&#8208;motif is known to allow for the preparation of moderately isotactic polypropylene copolymers.

      <title>Structural evidence for a [4Fe&#8208;5S] intermediate in the non&#8208;redox desulfuration of thiouracil</title>
      <dc:description>We recently discovered a [Fe&#8208;S]&#8208;containing protein with  in vivo  thiouracil  desulfidase activity called TudS. We report here the crystal structure of TudS, refined at 1.5 &#197; resolution, which harbors a [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster, bound by three cysteines only. Incubation of TudS crystals with 4&#8208;thiouracil trapped the cluster with a hydrosulfide ligand bound to the fourth non&#8208;protein&#8208;bonded iron, as established by the sulfur anomalous signal. This indicates that a [4Fe&#8208;5S] state of the cluster is a catalytic intermediate in the desulfuration reaction. Structural data and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis indicate that a water molecule is located next to the hydrosulfide ligand and to two catalytically important residues, Ser101 and Glu45. This information together with modeling studies allow us to propose a mechanism for the unprecedented nonredox enzymatic desulfuration of thiouracil, in which a [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster binds and activates the sulfur atom of the substrate.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By use of a macrocyclic phosphinite pincer ligand and bulky substrate substituents, we demonstrate how the mechanical bond can be leveraged to promote the oxidative addition of an interlocked 1,3&#8208;diyne to a rhodium(I) center.

      <title>Oligosilanes as Silyl Radical Precursors through Oxidative Si&#8722;Si Bond Cleavage using Redox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Oligosilanes are of great interest in the fields of organic photonics and electronics. In this communication, a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes through cleavage of a trimethylsilyl&#8208;polysilanyl Si&#8722;Si bond is explored. These reactions smoothly occur on readily available organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes and other oligosilanes in the presence of an Ir  III  &#8208;based photo&#8208;redox catalyst under visible light irradiation. Silyl radicals are generated through single electron oxidation of the oligosilane assisted by the solvent. The introduced method exhibits broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance with respect to the organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silane and alkene components, enabling the construction of functionalized trisilanes. In addition, this catalytic system can be also applied to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as silyl radical acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling between Hydrazine and Aryl Halides with Hydroxide Base at Low Loadings of Palladium by Rate&#8208;Determining Deprotonation of Bound Hydrazine</title>
      <dc:description>We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N coupling of hydrazine with (hetero)aryl chlorides and bromides to form aryl hydrazines with catalyst loadings as low as 100 ppm of Pd and KOH. Mechanistic studies revealed two catalyst resting states: an arylpalladium(II) hydroxide and arylpalladium(II) chloride. These compounds are present in two interconnected catalytic cycles and react with hydrazine and base or hydrazine alone to give the product. The selectivity of the hydroxide complex with hydrazine to form aryl over diaryl hydrazine was lower than that of the chloride complex, as well as the catalytic reaction. In contrast, the selectivity of the chloride complex closely matches that of the catalytic reaction, indicating that the aryl hydrazine is derived from this complex. Kinetic studies show that the coupling process occurs by rate&#8208;limiting deprotonation of a hydrazine&#8208;bound arylpalladium(II) chloride complex to give an arylpalladium(II) hydrazido complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Reactivity of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazole: Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Click Reaction and Denitrogenative Annulation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: A general catalytic method using Mn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based catalytic system is discovered that enables two different reactions (click reaction and denitrogenative annulation) affording two different classes of nitrogen heterocycles, such as 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles (with a pyridyl motif) and 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;pyridines. Mechanistic investigations suggest that while click reaction likely proceeds through an ionic mechanism, which is different from the traditional click reaction, denitrogenative annulation undergoes likely via an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate rather than the metalloradical intermediate. Collectively, the discovered method is highly efficient that offer obvious advantages over other methods, as it excludes multi&#8208;step synthesis of these classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic molecules and produces only environmentally benign N2 gas by&#8208;product.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation of Nucleophilic Allylboranes from Molecular Hydrogen and Allenes Catalyzed by a Pyridonate Borane that Displays Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the  in situ  generation of nucleophilic allylboranes from H  2  and allenes mediated by a pyridonate borane that displays frustrated Lewis Pair reactivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations reveal that upon H  2  activation, the covalently bound pyridonate substituent becomes a datively bound pyridone ligand. Dissociation of the formed pyridone borane complex liberates Piers borane and enables a hydroboration of the allene. The allylboranes generated in this way are reactive towards nitriles. A catalytic protocol for the formation of allylboranes from H  2  and allenes and the allylation of nitriles has been devised. This catalytic reaction is a conceptually new way to use molecular H  2  in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Spectroscopies in One: Interference of Circular Dichroism and Raman Optical Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Previously, we and other laboratories have reported an unusual and strong Raman optical activity (ROA) induced in solvents by chiral dyes. Various theories of the phenomenon appeared, but they were not capable of explaining fully the observed ROA band signs and intensities. In this work, an analysis based both on the light scattering theory and dedicated experiments provides a more complete understanding. For example, double&#8208;cell magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic ROA experiments with copper&#8208;porphyrin complexes show that the induced chirality is observed without any contact of the solvents with the complex. The results thus indicate that a combination of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) with the polarized Raman scattering is responsible for the effect. The degree of circularity of solvent vibrational bands is a principal molecular property participating in the event. The insight and the possibility to predict the chirality transfer promise future applications in spectroscopy, chemical analysis and polarized imaging.</dc:description>

The insight and the possibility to predict the chirality transfer promise future applications in spectroscopy, chemical analysis and polarized imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A new route towards green ammonia synthesis through plasma&#8208;driven nitrogen oxidation and catalytic reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Ammonia is an industrial large volume chemical, with its main application in fertilizer production. It also attracts increasing attention as a green energy vector. Over the past century, ammonia production has been dominated by the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, in which a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gas is converted to ammonia at high temperatures and pressures. Haber&#8208;Bosch processes with natural gas as source of hydrogen are responsible for a significant share of the global CO2  emissions. Processes involving plasma are currently investigated as an alternative for decentralized ammonia production powered by renewable energy sources. In this work, we present the PNOCRA process (Plasma Nitrogen Oxidation and Catalytic Reduction to Ammonia), combining plasma&#8208;assisted nitrogen oxidation and Lean NOx  Trap technology, adopted from diesel engine exhaust gas aftertreatment technology. PNOCRA achieves an energy requirement of 4.6 MJ/mol NH3, which is an over 4&#8208;fold energy reduction compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plasma&#8208;enabled ammonia synthesis from N2  and H2  with reasonable yield (&gt;1%).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is an urgent demand for analytic approaches that enable quick, precise and representative quantification of transport of small biologically active chemical compounds across cellular membranes. In this study, we established a new means to monitor membrane permeation kinetics, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy strictly confined to a ~500 nm thick silica mesoporous substrate, positioned underneath a planar supported cell membrane mimic. This way, we demonstrate spatiotemporally resolved membrane&#8208;permeation kinetics of a small molecule model drug, felodipine, while simultaneously being able to control the integrity of, and follow drug binding to, the cell membrane mimic.

      <title>From Sergeants and Soldiers to Chiral Conflict Effects in Helical Polymers by Acting on the Conformational Composition of the Comonomers</title>
      <dc:description>Different communication mechanisms can be switched within a copolymer by acting on the conformational composition of the components and their chirality. Thus, a Sergeant and Soldiers effect is produced in two diastereomeric copolymer series &#8212;poly[(  S  )&#8208;  1  r  &#8208;  co  &#8208;(  S  )&#8208;  2  (  1&#8208;r  )  ] and poly[(  R  )&#8208;  1&#160;r  &#8208;  co  &#8208;(  S  )&#8208;  2  (  1&#8208;r  )  ]&#8212; due to the presence in chloroform of a preferred conformation in (  S  )&#8208;  2  , and a conformational equilibrium in  1  , where a  P  helix is induced independently of the absolute configuration of the Soldier. In THF, the presence of a conformational equilibrium at the pendants of the two components produces a reciprocal chiral enhancement effect by copolymerization of the two monomers, while in DMF, a third chiral to chiral communication switch is produced due to the presence of a single conformer at the pendant group of the two components. In such case, a Chiral Conflict or Chiral Accord effect is produced depending if the two components induce the same or the opposite helical sense.</dc:description>

      <title>Closed Shell Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Complex with Fe&#8211;O Triple Bond: Computational Design, Synthesis, and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates in nature contain two unpaired electrons in the Fe&#8211;O antibonding orbitals, which are thought to contribute to their high reactivity. To challenge this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized closed&#8208;shell singlet iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(quinisox)Fe(O)]  +  (  1  +  ;  quinisox&#8208;H  = (  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;isoxazoline&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenyl)quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;carboxamide). We identified the quinisox ligand by DFT computational screening out of over 450 candidates. Following the ligand synthesis, we detected  1  +  in the gas phase and confirmed its spin state by visible and infrared photodissociation spectroscopy (IRPD). The Fe&#8211;O stretching frequency in  1  +  is 960.5 cm  &#8208;1  , consistent with Fe&#8211;O triple&#8208;bond, which was also confirmed by multireference calculations. The unprecedented bond strength is accompanied by high gas&#8208;phase reactivity of  1  +  in oxygen atom transfer and in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. This challenges the current view of the spin&#8208;state driven reactivity of the Fe&#8211;O complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacial Polymerization: From Chemistry to Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of functional polymer materials has benefitted greatly from interfacial polymerization, and is still a dynamic area. This Review highlights the developments, latest progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with interfacial polymerization.







Abstract
Interfacial polymerization, where a chemical reaction is confined at the liquid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;air interface, exhibits a strong advantage for the controllable fabrication of films, capsules, and fibers for use as separation membranes and electrode materials. Recent developments in technology and polymer chemistry have brought new vigor to interfacial polymerization. Here, we consider the history of interfacial polymerization in terms of the polymerization types: interfacial polycondensation, interfacial polyaddition, interfacial oxidative polymerization, interfacial polycoordination, interfacial supramolecular polymerization, and some others. The accordingly emerging functional materials are highlighted, as well as the challenges and opportunities brought by new technologies for interfacial polymerization. Interfacial polymerization will no doubt keep on developing and producing a series of fascinating functional materials.

      <title>Build&#8208;up of Cationic Azahelicenes via Regioselective Three&#8208;Component Annulation Using in Situ Activation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Described herein is a build&#8208;up strategy of cationic azahelicenes through the three&#8208;component annulation reaction of isoquinoline, indole and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE), in which DCE serves as in situ activating agent for C1&#8722;H activation of isoquinoline, vinyl equivalent and solvent. This in situ activation annulation reaction features a facile one&#8208;step synthesis and complete regioselectivity. The complete regioselectivity of C1 over C3 for the isoquinoline ring paves a path to the helical structure in a highly ordered sequence. As a representative example, the ionic [5]azahelicenium fluorophore 3h exhibits the potential as a mitochondria&#8208;targeted biomarker with good photostability and low cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of O&#8208;Heteroacenes via Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
      <dc:description>We report a novel catalyst&#8208;free approach to benzoannulated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes. Unlike other existing methods, the presented reaction does not require oxygen&#8208;containing precursor and relies on outer oxygen source i.e. potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, which serves as an O  2&#8208;  synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron&#8208;donating groups and enables de&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation required for the complete annulation. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to introduce five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanomotors Sense Local Physicochemical Heterogeneities in Tumor Microenvironments</title>
      <dc:description>The invasion of cancer is brought about by continuous interaction of malignant cells with their surrounding tissue microenvironment. Investigating the remodeling of local extracellular matrix (ECM) by invading cells can therefore provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of cancer progression. In this paper, we use an active and untethered nanomechanical tool, realized as magnetically driven nanomotors, to locally probe a 3D tissue culture microenvironment. We made the surprising observation that nanomotors preferentially adhere to the ECM near cancer cells and magnitude of the adhesive force increased with cell lines of higher metastatic ability. We hypothesized and experimentally confirmed that sialic acid linkage specific to cancer&#8208;secreted ECM makes it differently charged, which determines this adhesive behavior. In an assay consisting of both cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous epithelia, designed to mimic the in vivo histopathological milieu of a malignant breast tumor, we find the nanomotors to preferentially decorate the region around the cancer cells. The findings reported here can lead to promising applications in cancer diagnosis and imaging, quantification of cancer aggression and in vivo drug delivery applications. They also establish the tremendous potential of magnetic nanomotors for fundamental studies of cancer mechanobiology.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of CO Electrooxidation on Pt(hkl) Single Crystal Surfaces in Acidic Solution</title>
      <dc:description>The adsorption and electrooxidation of CO molecules at well&#8208;defined Pt(  hkl  ) single crystal electrode surfaces is a key step towards addressing catalyst poisoning mechanisms in fuel cells. Herein, we employed  in situ  electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) coupled with theoretical calculation to investigate CO electrooxidation on Pt(  hkl  ) surfaces in acidic solution. We successfully obtained the Raman signal of top and bridge site adsorbed CO* molecules on Pt(111) and Pt(100). In contrast, on Pt(110) surfaces only top site adsorbed CO* was observed during the entire electrooxidation process. Direct spectroscopic evidence for OH* and COOH* species forming on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces was afforded and confirmed subsequently via isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations. In summary, the formation and adsorption of OH* and COOH* species plays a vital role in expediting the electrooxidation process, which relates with the pre&#8208;oxidation peak of CO electrooxidation. This work deepens knowledge of the CO electrooxidation process and provides new perspectives for the design of anti&#8208;poisoning and highly effective catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct imaging of atomic permeation through a vacancy defect in the carbon lattice</title>
      <dc:description>Porous graphene has shown promise as a new generation of selective membrane for sieving atoms, ions and molecules.

      <title>A General Strategy for Development of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probes for in vivo High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic&#8208;dye based NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes, owing to their high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deeper penetration, are highly useful for deep&#8208;tissue high&#8208;contrast imaging in vivo. However, due to the lack of suitable dyes, it is still a challenge to design activatable NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes. In this work, we have designed a novel class of polymethine dyes (NIRII&#8208;RTs) with bright (quantum yield up to 2.03%), stable and anti&#8208;solvent quenching NIR&#8208;II emission, together with large Stokes shifts. Significantly, unlike most of reported NIR&#8208;II fluorophores which show uncontrollable fluorescence, the novel NIR&#8208;II dyes NIRII&#8208;RT3 and NIRII&#8208;RT4 equipped with the functional carboxylic&#8208;acid group could serve as effective NIR&#8208;II platforms for the design of activatable bioimaging probe with high contrast. As a proof of concept, we synthesized a series of target&#8208;activatable NIRII&#8208;RT probes (NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;pH, NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;ATP &amp; NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;Hg) for pH, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and metal ion detecting.

      <dc:description>The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV&#8208;1 gp41 contains epitopes for at least four broadly neutralizing antibodies. Depending on solution conditions and construct design, different structures have been reported for this segment.

Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the association is exothermic, more favorable in D  2  O than H  2  O, and increases with ionic strength, indicating hydrophobically driven intermolecular interactions. Circular dichroism,  13  C  &#945;  chemical shifts, NOE, and hydrogen exchange rates reveal that MPER undergoes a structural transition from predominately unfolded monomer at low concentrations to an &#945;&#8208;helical trimer at high concentrations.

The interaction of the RBD&#160;13C&#8208;labelled glycans with different&#160;human lectins, which are expressed in different organs and tissues that may be affected during the infection process, has also been evaluated by NMR. In particular,&#160;15N&#8208;labelled galectins (galectins&#8208;3, &#8208;7 and &#8208;8 N&#8208;terminal), Siglecs (siglec&#8208;8, siglec&#8208;10), and C&#8208;type lectins (DC&#8208;SIGN, MGL) have been employed. Complementary experiments&#160;from&#160;the glycoprotein perspective or from the lectin&#8217;s point of view have permitted to disentangle the specific interacting epitopes in each case. Based on these findings, 3D models of the interacting complexes have been proposed.</dc:description>

Abstract
Triflic anhydride mediated activation of acetophenones leads to highly electrophilic intermediates that can undergo a variety of transformations when treated with nucleophiles. This electrophilic ketone activation gives access to &#945;&#8208;arylated and &#945;&#8208;oxyaminated acetophenones under metal&#8208;free conditions in moderate to excellent yields and enables extension to the synthesis of arylated morpholines via generation of vinylsulfonium salts. Computational investigations confirmed the transient existence of intermediates derived from vinyl triflates and the role of the oxygen atoms at the para position of aromatic ring in facilitating their stabilisation.

      <title>Supercritical Water is not Hydrogen Bonded</title>
      <dc:description>
Supercritical water possesses vastly different properties compared to its liquid phase, for instance it is well known that the famous tetrahedral H&#8208;bond network is destroyed. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009640), P. Schienbein and D. Marx further unveil that supercritical water should not be considered as a H&#8208;bonded fluid at all due to ultrafast reorientational dynamics on the timescale of intermolecular H&#8208;bond vibrations. Instead, it behaves much like an isotropic van der Waals fluid.
