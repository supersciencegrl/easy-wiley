         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 Coupling of Carbon&#8208;Centered Benzyl Radicals with (Me4N)SCF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast with the well&#8208;established C(sp2)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF3 bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl&#160;electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling of racemic benzyl&#160;halides and three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF3&#8208;containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homochiral Tetrahedral Cage Comprising Only Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. Here, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds &#8212; a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potentiometric Dual&#8208;Channel Microsensor Reveals that Fluctuation of H2S is Less pH&#8208;Dependent During Spreading Depolarization in the Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases.  However, real&#8208;time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H2S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we firstobserve real time changes of H2S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H2S are completely suppressed when the rat pre&#8208;treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H2S&#8208;producing enzyme, indicating H2S fluctuation might be related to enzyme&#8208;dependent pathway during SD and less pH&#8208;dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H2S and the molecular basis of SD&#8208;associated diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane&#8208;Enabled Electrophilic Amination of Arylboronic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we describe the use of amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes in the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, which includes one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds through an electrophilic amination process from a tetravalent borate complex with a B&#8722;N dative bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9 mN/m to 36.1 mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37 &#197;m&#183;s&#8208;1 to 4.61 &#197;m&#183;s&#8208;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14% to 25.32%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82% of its initial PCE after 800 h aging at 85 &#186;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing a major DNA weakness: resolving the groove and sequence selectivity of the diimine complex [&#923;&#8208;Ru(phen)2phi]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grooves of DNA provide recognition sites for many nucleic acid binding proteins and anticancer drugs such as the covalently binding cisplatin. Here we report a crystal structure showing, for the first time, groove selectivity by an intercalating ruthenium complex. The complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+, where phi = 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenediimine, is bound to the DNA decamer duplex d(CCGGTACCGG)2. The structure shows that the metal complex is symmetrically bound in the major groove at the central TA/TA step, and asymmetrically bound in the minor groove at the adjacent GG/CC steps. A third type of binding links the strands, in which each terminal cytosine base stacks with one phen ligand. The overall binding stoichiometry is four Ru complexes per duplex. Complementary biophysical measurements confirm the binding preference for the &#923;&#8208;enantiomer and show a high affinity for TA/TA steps and, more generally, TA&#8208;rich sequences. A striking enantiospecific elevation of melting temperatures is found for oligonucleotides which include the TATA box sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Nanomaterial&#8208;Biosystem Interactions through Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between biosystems and nanomaterials regulate most of their theranostic and nanomedicine applications. These nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and are influenced by a number of entangled factors, including but not limited to the physicochemical features of nanomaterials, the types and characteristics of the interacting biosystems, and the properties of the surrounding microenvironments. Over the years, different experimental approaches coupled with computational modeling have revealed important insights into these interactions, although many outstanding questions remain unanswered. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and to further push the boundary of this field. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and provides our perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358 mol CO2 molPt&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and 99% CO selectivity at 300 &#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;state Conversion by Asymmetrical Orbital Hybridization in Ni&#8208;doped Co3O4 to Boost Singlet Oxygen Generation for Microbial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in environmental and biomedical disinfection fields. Electrocatalytic processes hold great potential for 1O2 generation, but remain challenging. Herein, a facile Ni doping converted spin&#8208;state transition approach is reported for boosting 1O2 production. Magnetic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni occupied at the octahedral site of Co3O4 can effectively induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8208;Co3O4 generate appropriate binding strength and enhance electron transfer between the Co centers with oxygen intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni&#8208;Co3O4 for effective generating 1O2. In neutral conditions, 1&#215;106 CFU mL&#8208;1 Gram&#8208;negative ESBL&#8208;producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be inactivated by Ni&#8208;Co3O4 system within 5 min. Further antibacterial mechanisms indicate that 1O2 can lead to cell membrane damage and DNA degradation so as to irreversible cell death. Additionally, the developed Ni&#8208;Co3O4 system can effectively inactivate bacteria from wastewater and bioaerosols. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;spin electrocatalysis to boost 1O2 generation for disinfection process.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching from Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Single Crystal for Low&#8208;Threshold Laser to Phosphorescence in Amorphous&#8208;Film for Highly Efficient OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes containing Ir or Pt are work horse in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons in electroluminescence (EL) owing to strong heavy&#8208;atom effect. Recently, organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) have achieved high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in rigid crystalline state, which, however, is unsuitable for OLED fabrication, therefore leading to an EL efficiency far low behind those of metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes. Here, we reported a luminescence mechanism switch from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in single crystal microwires to ORTP in amorphous thin&#8208;films, based on a tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate derivative of DtCzBF2. Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires exhibit aggregation induced emission (AIE), enabling TADF microlasers at 473 nm with an optical gain coefficient as high as 852 cm&#8208;1. In contrast, loosely packed dimers of DtCzBF2 formed in guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films decrease the oscillator strength of fluorescence transition but stabilize triplets for ORTP with a PLQY up to 61%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with EQE approaching 20%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Monoterpene Isomerization by Guiding Challenging Carbocation Rearrangement Reactions in Engineered Squalene&#8209;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interconversion of monoterpenes is facilitated by a complex network of carbocation rearrangement pathways. Controlling these isomerization pathways is challenging when using common Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid catalysts, which often produce product mixtures that are difficult to separate. In contrast, natural monoterpene cyclases exhibit high control over the carbocation rearrangement reactions but are reliant on phosphorylated substrates.&#160;In this study, we present engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases from&#160;Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius&#160;(AacSHC) that catalyze the challenging isomerization of monoterpenes with unprecedented precision.&#160;Starting from a promiscuous isomerization of (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;pinene, we first demonstrate noticeable shifts in the product distribution solely by introducing single point mutations. Furthermore, we showcase the tuneable cation steering by enhancing (+)&#8208;borneol selectivity from 1% to &gt;90% (&gt;99%&#160;de) aided by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Our combined experimental and computational data&#160;suggests&#160;that the reorganization of key aromatic residues leads to the restructuring of the water network that facilitates the selective termination of the secondary isobornyl cation. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of carbocation rearrangements and sets the stage for target&#8208;oriented skeletal reorganization of broadly abundant terpenes.</dc:description>

Herein, based upon a newly developed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of conjugated polyenoic acids, a variety of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif (with E&#8208;configured internal olefin) was generated as the corresponding &#945;&#8208;adducts in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective manner. Utilizing 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif as key intermediates, we further demonstrated their synthetic potential by expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids) within 4&#8208;7 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion through Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak adsorption of gas reactants and strong binding of intermediates present a significant challenge for most transition metal oxides, particularly in the realm of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we demonstrate that the adsorption can be fine&#8208;tuned by phase engineering of oxide catalysts. An oxygen vacancy mediated topological phase transition in Ni&#8208;Co oxide nanowires, supported on a hierarchical graphene aerogel (GA), is observed from a spinel phase to a rock&#8208;salt phase. Such in&#8208;situ phase transition empowers the Ni&#8208;Co oxide catalyst with a strong internal electric field and the attainment of abundant oxygen vacancies. Among a series of catalysts, the in&#8208;situ transformed spinel/rock&#8208;salt heterojunction supported on GA stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, yielding an impressive CO production rate of 12.5 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1 and high selectivity of 96.5%. This remarkable performance is a result of the robust interfacial coupling between two topological phases that optimizes the electronic structures through directional charge transfer across interfaces. The phase transition process induces more Co2+ in octahedral site, which can effectively enhance the Co&#8208;O covalency. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 molecules and desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the energetic barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Crystals&#160;Constructed by Polar Molecular Cages: A Promising System for Exploring High&#8208;performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter&#8208;molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure&#8208;house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P4Sn] (n = 3&#8208;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &#945;&#8208;P4S5, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#160;&#215; AGS), wide band gap (3.02 eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8208;14.7 &#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Threading a Linear Molecule Through a Macrocycle Thanks to Boron: Optical&#160;Properties of the Threaded Species and Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two BODIPYs and two boron&#160;b&#8208;diketonates were threaded through a macrocycle bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit, showing thus the ability of boron to act as a gathering atom. The new threaded species were characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as by X&#8208;ray crystallography for one of them and their properties rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. The BODIPYs exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91% and enhanced photostability compared to their non&#8208;threaded homologues. A rotaxane was synthesized using this threading strategy after stoppering and removing the boron with potassium hydroxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamentals of Unanticipated Efficiency of Gd2O3&#8208;based Catalysts in Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane/ethylene poses a significant challenge for commercialization. The required improvements are hampered by the uncertainties associated with the reaction mechanism due to its complexity. Herein, we report about 90% selectivity to the target products at 11% methane conversion over Gd2O3&#8208;based catalysts at 700&#176;C using N2O as the oxidant. Sophisticated kinetic studies have suggested the nature of adsorbed oxygen species and their binding strength as key parameters for undesired methane oxidation to carbon oxides. These descriptors can be controlled by a metal oxide promoter for Gd2O3.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Metal/Graphene and 2D Metal/Graphene/Metal Systems&#160;for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiently transforming CO2 into renewable energy sources is crucial for decarbonization efforts. Formic acid (HCOOH) holds a great promise as a hydrogen storage compound due to its high hydrogen density, non&#8208;toxicity, and stability under ambient conditions. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on conventional carbon black&#8208;supported metal catalysts operates at ambient conditions, however, it faces challenges such as low stability through dissolution and agglomeration and requires high overpotentials to overcome the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we modify the physical/chemical properties of metal surfaces by depositing metal monolayers on graphene (M/G) to create highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Strong covalent bonding between graphene and metal is induced by the hybridization of sp and d orbitals, especially the sharp , , and &#160;orbitals of metal near the Fermi level. Moreover, charge polarization on graphene in M/G enables the deposition of another thin metallic film, forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) structures. Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO2RR to HCOOH and HER, we find that Pt/G, Pd/G, and Pt/G/Ag exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p&#8208;block elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we highlight the design of single metal atom catalysts at the atomic structure level by focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss their biological catalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcomes. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Currently, there is still a gap in a comprehensive overview of the connection between structures and biocatalytic mechanisms of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this minireview, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in&#8208;source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three&#8208;dimensional data domain (Precursor m/z, Product m/z, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product m/z values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.







Abstract
Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in-source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three-dimensional data domain (Precursor &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt;, Product &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt;, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in-source collision-induced dissociation (IS-CID) with two-dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS-CID is employed as a gas-phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full-length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D-MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dipole Coupling Accelerated H2O Dissociation by Magnesium&#8208;Based Intermetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The water (H2O) dissociation is critical for various H2O&#8208;associated reactions, including water gas shift, hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrolysis corrosion. While the d&#8208;band center concept offers a catalyst design guideline for H2O activation, it cannot be applied to intermetallic or main group elements&#8208;based systems because Coulomb interaction was not considered. Herein, using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we illustrate the critical role of the dipole of the intermetallic catalysts for H2O dissociation. The H2O dissociation kinetics can be enhanced using MgxMey (Me = Co, Ni, Cu, Si and Al) as catalysts, and the hydrogen generation rate of Mg2Ni&#8208;loaded Mg reached 80 times as high as Ni&#8208;loaded Mg. The adsorbed H2O molecules strongly couple with the Mg&#8210;Me dipole of MgxMey, lowering the H2O dissociation barrier. The dipole&#8208;based H2O dissociation mechanism is applicable to non&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based systems, such as Mg2Si and Mg17Al12, offering a flexible catalyst design strategy for controllable H2O dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light Promoted Iridium(III)/Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Alkynes to Aziridinoquinoxalines Through the Intermediacy of Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript describes the development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalytic system under green LED photolysis (lmax&#160;= 525 nm). This mild method features high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity and was used to generate 30&#160;highly functionalized substituted dihydroquinoxalines in 36&#8208;98% yield. This transformation was also carried asymmetrically using&#160;(S,R)&#8208;N&#8208;PINAP as the chiral ligand to provide 9 chiral addition products in 96:4 to 86:14 e.r. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations of this reaction suggest a mechanism that involves Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed triplet energy transfer mechanism followed by a ring&#8208;opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates. These azomethine intermediates undergo sequential protonation/copper(I) acetelide addition to provide the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)&#8208;rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency







Abstract
The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the irreversible thermal transformation of electrolytes is typically attributed to solvent boiling, which disrupts solvent intermolecular interactions, our research revealed that hygroscopic solutes shift the determining factor to solute decomposition, breaking solute intramolecular bonds. As intramolecular bonds are much stronger, it enables ultrahigh thermal tolerance of non&#8208;van der Waals solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes.







Abstract
Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100&#8201;&#176;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8&#8201;&#176;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacenes were synthesized on Au(111) and their properties were characterized by combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many body calculations. The study confirmed the open&#8208;shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.







Abstract
The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many&#8208;body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine Learning models were trained on the antibacterial activity of 288 ruthenium&#8208;arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and utilised to predict novel compounds based on a virtual library. 54 new compounds were synthesised and found to possess a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate compared to the training set.







Abstract
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7&#8201;%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4&#8201;%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8722;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 51 enzymes demethylate sterols, releasing formic acid (DCOOH). Analysis of the DCOOH by&#8208;product enables the mechanistic discrimination of the contribution(s) of Compound 0 (Cpd 0) and Compound I (Cpd I) to catalysis. When enzyme reactions were run under 18O2 (red), &gt;50&#8201;% of the DCOOH yielded contained one atom of 18O (for all P450 51 enzymes tested), indicative of the major contribution of Cpd 0 in 24,25&#8208;dihydrolanosterol C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, for example, with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved three&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8722;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#8722;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of 18O incorporation into formic acid from 18O2 provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% 18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#8722; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one 18O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two 18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization, short pH&#8208;responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen&#8208;bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher&#8208;order structures.







Abstract
Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208;driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;N,N&#8208;Dimethylacrylamide copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen waste species in water. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime, an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide over copper catalysts under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen species. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide for the first time over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2 and wastewater.

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.







Abstract
We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides high sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

&lt;p&gt;Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid-state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build-up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Chirality in ClMBA2SnI4 2D Perovskite
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Sn&#8208;based 2D chiral perovskite ClMBA2SnI4 is reported showing appealing optical properties with a low band gap and a broad emission centered in the red part of the spectrum. Computational modelling describes both the chiral transfer effect on the band structure and the origin of broad emission. Preliminary correlations between the nature of chiral ligand and central atom on the chiroptical response of chiral perovskites are proposed.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8722;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA=1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12&#8197;eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7&#8197;eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8211;530&#8197;nm range. Density functional theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.

         <title>Deep Characterisation of the sn&#8208;Isomer Lipidome Using High&#8208;Throughput Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition and Ozone&#8208;Induced Dissociation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shotgun lipidomics workflow incorporating data&#8208;independent acquisition and gas&#8208;phase ozonolysis enables characterisation of almost 1000 sn&#8208;resolved PC and PE lipids across four cell lines using an automated analysis pipeline. It reveals that isomer populations are tightly controlled in a cell&#8208;specific manner and enables identification of lipids containing ultralong&#8208;chain monounsaturated fatty acyls predominately at the sn&#8208;1 position.







Abstract
In recent years there has been a significant interest in the development of innovative lipidomics techniques capable of resolving lipid isomers. To date, methods applied to resolving sn&#8208;isomers have resolved only a limited number of species. We report a workflow based on ozone&#8208;induced dissociation for untargeted characterisation of hundreds of sn&#8208;resolved glycerophospholipid isomers from biological extracts in under 20&#8197;min, coupled with an automated data analysis pipeline. It provides an order of magnitude increase in the number of sn&#8208;isomer pairs identified as compared to previous reports and reveals that sn&#8208;isomer populations are tightly regulated and significantly different between cell lines. The sensitivity of this method and potential for de novo molecular discovery is further demonstrated by the identification of unexpected lipids containing ultra&#8208;long monounsaturated acyl chains at the sn&#8208;1 position.

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.







Abstract
Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a viscosity&#8208;sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe, ER&#8208;ZS, which can monitor ER stress&#8208;induced viscosity changes in real time. ER&#8208;ZS is also an excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia type&#8197;I photosensitizer that activates tumor cell pyroptosis by damaging the ER pathway.







Abstract
The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified continuous flow process for the production of glycerol carbonate from bio&#8208;based glycidol and stoichiometric CO2 in the presence of a homogeneous organocatalyst. It features an unprecedented mechanism and fast CO2 capture rate, which set robust foundations for large scale operation.







Abstract
A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton's base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6&#8197;kg day&#8722;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7&#8197;kg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;L&#8722;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30&#8197;s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Pyrene&#8208;Based 1,4&#8208;Dithiins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral pyrene&#8208;based 1,4&#8208;dithiins with cisoid or transoid connectivity between their cyclopenta[e]pyrene units on the dithiin core was introduced and their chiroptical properties were studied. The presence of one or two cyclopenta[e]pyrene units at the dithiin moiety was found to lead to different chiroptical parameters.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds are very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism, with respect to the g values, depending on their connectivity.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for upcycling PET waste into high&#8208;valued chemicals. The distinct phase structures of ZrO2, with different acid sites, play a crucial role in regulating product selectivity. Specifically, 5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2, with weak acid sites, shows high selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of MMB, while 5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2, featuring strong acid sites, predominantly produces overhydrogenated PX







Abstract
Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of curved metalloporphyrin tectons via a combination of coordinative and non&#8208;covalent interactions leads to unprecedented supramolecular solids with extremely large void volumes. The intricate interaction patterns found in these solids are analogous to those in some metal&#8208; and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, offering new routes toward porous molecular crystals.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8208;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68&#8201;% to 76&#8201;%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;nanometer long iridium&#8208;cornered metallorectangle was obtained and used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of planar guests. This slit&#8208;shaped metallobox is able to form host&#8211;guest complexes with a variety of planar molecules, which slide from one side of the cavity to the other, with a large amplitude motion that was experimentally quantified.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Bipolarolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B was achieved by using a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantiomerically enriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.

         <title>Enhanced TROSY Effect in [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C] Adenosine and ATP Analogs Facilitates NMR Spectroscopy of Very Large Biological RNAs in Solution</title>

2&#8208;19F&#8208;2&#8208;13C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic 19F&#8208;13C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic 19F&#8208;13C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre&#8208;miR&#8208;17&#8208;NPSL1&#8208;RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A&#8208;labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2&#8208;1H, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;anisotropy and the dipole&#8208;dipole&#8208;components of TROSY&#8208;resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights. With the synthesis of a non&#8208;hydrolysable [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;triphosphate, we facilitate the probing of co&#8208;factor binding in kinase complexes and NMR&#8208;based inhibitor binding studies in such systems. Our labels allow a straightforward assignment for larger RNAs via a divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer/mutational approach. The new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine precursors are a valuable addition to the RNA NMR toolbox and will allow the study of large RNAs/RNA protein complexes in vitro and in cells.

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) was developed to achieve dense zinc deposition and broken side&#8208;reaction loops in the Zn//V2O5 system simultaneously.







Abstract
The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8722;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500&#8197;h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000&#8197;cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028&#8201;% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ChemPU platform streamlines chemistry by automating kinetic measurements, bridging synthesis and analysis. It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.







Abstract
Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;Halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs3Bi2Br9 into one&#8208;dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O2&#8722; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.







Abstract
Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; into one-dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas-solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one-dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record-breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mL&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA-15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in covalent systems. We have developed a hexameric pentacene system, in which three pentacene dimers are covalently linked to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. This allows for an entropically driven triplet diffusion, resulting in higher yields of free triplets, and establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems.







Abstract
Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular cluster formation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling which preserves rapid formation of 1(T1T1).

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbubbles can be biointerfaced by rationally regulating the platelet membrane surfactant activity at the gas&#8208;liquid interface. The protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratios (P&#8201;:&#8201;L ratios) of the platelet membranes are reduced to stabilize the platesome microbubbles (PMBs). The activated conformation of &#945;IIb&#946;3 grants PMBs the ability for molecular ultrasound diagnosis of acute thrombosis.







Abstract
Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4&#8201;% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8197;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8&#8197;dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.

         <title>Intermediates in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview we present and discussed a series of examples from various areas in which reactive intermediates have been detected during mechanochemical reactions. Understanding the factors behind the formation and stabilization of these intermediates could enhance mechanochemical methods and chemical reaction development.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions offer methodological and environmental advantages for chemical synthesis, constantly attracting attention within the scientific community. Besides unmistakable sustainability advantages, the conditions under which mechanochemical reactions occur, namely solventless conditions, sometimes facilitate the isolation of otherwise labile or inaccessible products. Despite these advantages, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanisms of these reactions and the types of intermediates involved. Nevertheless, in an expanding number of cases, ex situ and in situ monitoring techniques have allowed for the observation, characterization, and isolation of reaction intermediates in mechanochemical transformations. In this Minireview, we present a series of examples in which reactive intermediates have been detected in mechanochemical reactions spanning organic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Many of these intermediates were stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which played a pivotal role in guiding the chemical transformations. We believe that by uncovering and understanding such instances, the growing mechanochemistry community could find novel opportunities in catalysis and discover new mechanochemical reactions while achieving simplification in chemical reaction design.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) with tunable nanomagnetism for ultra&#8208;high field (UHF)&#8208;tailored activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Under a 9 T MRI, the pH&#8208;sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &gt;10&#8208;fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8722;S&#8722;) ligands lead to short &#964;&#8242;m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8722;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;&#8242;m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9&#8197;T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH&#8197;5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.

         <title>Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. We synthesized a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.







Abstract
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints; ideally, no attractive intermolecular interactions act between their components, which yields interesting physical properties. However, most reported previous topological gels were synthesized based on supramolecular interlocked structures such as polyrotaxane, for which attractive intermolecular interactions are essential. Here, we synthesize a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure using poly(ethylene glycol). When a water&#8208;soluble monomer (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) is polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrates the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components. The MN gels show unique physical properties as well a significantly high degree of swelling and high extensibility due to slipping of the physical cross&#8208;linking. We postulate this method to yield a new paradigm in gel science with unprecedented physical properties.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor cell membrane reactors are constructed in vivo for the precise location control of prodrug activation, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting liposomes install the bioorthogonal trigger on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that activates an externally delivered prodrug in situ.







Abstract
The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96&#8197;h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.

         <title>In situ Implanting 3D Carbon Network Reinforced Zinc Composite by Powder Metallurgy for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;based Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work provides a novel understanding of in situ implanted carbon network reinforcing Zn anode by powder metallurgy, moving from the surface/interface modification of Zn foil to the bulk phase regulation of Zn powder. The carbon network as an electron transport channel enhances the conductivity of the electrode and provides more nucleation sites to inhibit the growth of dendrites, realizing a highly reversible Zn anode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nonetheless, the dendrite formation, side reactions, and corrosion on anode have overshadowed their practical applications. Herein, we present an in situ grown carbon network reinforcing Zn matrix anode prepared by powder metallurgy. This carbon network provides an uninterrupted internal electron transport pathway and optimize the surface electric field distribution, thereby enabling highly reversible Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetrical cells demonstrate impressive stability, running for over 880&#8197;h with a low voltage hysteresis (&#8776;32&#8197;mV). Furthermore, this Zn matrix composite anode exhibits enhanced performance in both the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion and the Zn&#8208;air batteries. Notably, Zn//MnO2 cells display superior rate capabilities, while Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver high power density and impressive Zn utilization rate (84.9&#8201;%). This work provides a new idea of powder metallurgy method for modified Zn anodes, showcasing potential for large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Vinylogous Urea&#8212;Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, vinylogous urea (VUN) groups undergo much faster bond exchange than vinylogous urethanes (VUO), but this is not observed in their respective polymer networks. Surprisingly, blends of the two monomer types show increased network dynamics. The effects are correlated to hydrogen bonding, which catalyses covalent exchange and also reinforces networks by non&#8208;covalent interactions.







Abstract
Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Carbonylation towards Chiral Isoindolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide as C1 source, enabling highly efficient synthesis of chiral isoindolinones, is reported. The robustness and synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. Moreover, the chiral isoindolinones also proved to be efficient chiral ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide, an essential and easily available C1 feedstock, remains challenging. Here, we disclosed an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation catalyzed by inexpensive and readily available cobalt(II) salt. The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.

The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation of Metal Oxide Cluster and Non&#8208;Fluorinated Polymer for Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Proton Exchange Membranes for High&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective, non&#8208;fluorinated polymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are highly desirable in emerging hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) technology; however, their low proton conductivities and poor chemical and dimension stabilities hinder their further development as alternatives to commercial Nafion&#174;. Here, we report the inorganic&#8208;organic hybridization strategy by facilely complexing commercial polymers, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), with inorganic molecular nanoparticles, H3PW12O40 (PW) via supramolecular interaction. The strong affinity among them endows the obtained nanocomposites amphiphilicity and further lead to phase separation for bi&#8208;continuous structures with both inter&#8208;connected proton transportation channels and robust polymer scaffold, enabling high proton conductivities, mechanical/dimension stability and barrier performance, and the H2/O2 FCs equipped with the composite PEM show promising power densities and long&#8208;term stability. Interestingly, the hybrid PEM can be fabricated continuously in large scale at challenging ~10 um thickness via typical tape casting technique originated from their facile complexing strategy and the hybrids&#8217; excellent mechanical properties. This work not only provides potential material systems for commercial PEMs, but also raises interest for the research on hybrid composites for PEMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Modulating the Dissymmetry Factor of Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Soft Helical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high luminescent dissymmetry factor (glum) is crucial for diverse optoelectronic applications. In particular, dynamically controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP can profoundly advance these applications, but it is still unprecedented. This study introduces an effective strategy to achieve photoirradiation&#8208;driven chirality regulation in a bilayered structure film, which consists of a layer of soft helical superstructure incorporated with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and a layer of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer. The prepared bilayered film exhibits CP&#8208;OURTP with an emission lifetime of 805 ms and a glum value up to 1.38. Remarkably, the glum value of the resulting CP&#8208;OURTP film can be reversibly controlled between 0.6 and 1.38 over 20 cycles by light irradiation, representing the first example of dynamically controlling the glum in CP&#8208;OURTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Seed&#8208;Induced Living Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Supramolecular Polymerization in Water: Implications on Protein Adsorption and Enzyme Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biological systems, programmable supramolecular frameworks characterized by coordinated directional non&#8208;covalent interactions are widespread. However, only a small number of reports involve pure water&#8208;based dynamic supramolecular assembly of artificial &#960;&#8208;amphiphiles, primarily due to the formidable challenge of counteracting the strong hydrophobic dominance of the &#960;&#8208;surface in water, leading to undesired kinetic traps. This study reveals the pathway complexity in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated supramolecular polymerization of an amide&#8208;functionalized naphthalene monoimide (NMI) building block with hydrophilic oligo&#8208;oxyethylene (OE) wedges. O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 initially produced entropically driven, collapsed spherical particles in water (Agg&#8208;1); however, over a span of 72 h, these metastable Agg&#8208;1 gradually transformed into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (Agg&#8208;2), favoured by both entropy and enthalpy contributions. The intricate self&#8208;assembly pathways in O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 enable us to explore seed&#8208;induced living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) in water for controlled synthesis of monolayered 2D assemblies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nonspecific surface adsorption of a model enzyme, serine protease &#945;&#8208;Chymotrypsin (&#945;&#8208;ChT), and consequently its enzyme activity, which could be regulated by controlling the morphological transformation of O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 from Agg&#8208;1 to Agg&#8208;2. We delve into the thermodynamic aspects of such shape&#8208;dependent protein&#8208;surface interactions and unravel the impact of seed&#8208;induced LSP on temporally controlling the catalytic activity of  &#945;&#8208;ChT.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving the Origins of Superior Cycling Performance of Antimony Anode in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Comparison with Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying&#8208;type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 &#197;) than Li+ (0.76 &#197;), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na&#8208;Sb alloys than Li&#8208;Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large&#8208;volume&#8208;change electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;based separation has the merit of low carbon footprint. In this study, the pore size of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed for discriminating various pairs of hydrocarbon isomers. Specifically, Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo) membranes are developed for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. For n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation, the functional groups and proportion of the ligands in UiO&#8208;66 are gradually adjusted to effectively regulate the pore size, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes are constructed. In addition, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smaller pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Pyrazine: A Structurally Simple and Easily Accessible Electron&#8208;Deficient Building Block for n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano&#8208;functionalized highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 3,6&#8208;dibromopyrazine&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6&#8208;Dibromopyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one&#8208;step reaction and three&#8208;step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) polymers, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 is obtained for P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show high n&#8208;type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3 S cm&#8208;1/41.4 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2, and 33.9 S cm&#8208;1/30.4 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2, respectively. Hence, the cyano&#8208;functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low&#8208;cost and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient building block for constructing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing low-cost and high-performance n-type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron-deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n-type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano-functionalized highly electron-deficient building blocks, namely 3,6-dibromopyrazine-2-carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6-Dibromopyrazine-2,5-dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one-step reaction and three-step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor-acceptor (A-A) polymers, P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep-positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n-type organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85 cm2 V-1 s-1 is obtained for P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N-DMBI, P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz) show high n-type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3 S cm-1/41.4 &#956;W m-1 K-2, and 33.9 S cm-1/30.4 &#956;W m-1 K-2, respectively. Hence, the cyano-functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low-cost and readily accessible electron-deficient building block for constructing n-type polymer semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Base Cascades in Zeotype Single Crystal for Sugar Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically catalyzed production of fructose syrup from high concentrations of glucose is crucial for the food industry and biorefining. In this work, a single crystal catalyst was synthesized via protective desilication of zeolite while incorporating indium. Glucose was isomerized in methanol at concentrations as high as 33 wt.% before being hydrolyzed with water. The final fructose production was 54.9%, with 89.1% selectivity and 93.3% sugar recovery, the highest isomerization rate at the highest concentration ever reported. Indium was present in the single&#8208;crystal catalyst as oxide nanoparticles and boundary framework atoms, and it achieved intelligent cooperation in the production of fructose syrup in methanol by catalyzing isomerization and selective glycosidation, minimizing degradation due to fructose accumulation and eliminating side reactions. This study contributed to the advancement of the industrial practice of chemically catalyzed glucose isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nonbenzenoid Heteroacene Crystals Synthesized via In&#8208;Situ Embedding of Ladder Bipyrazinylenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely introducing  topological defects is an important strategy in nanographene crystal engineering because defects can tune &#960;&#8208;electronic structures and control molecular assemblies. The synergistic control of the synthesis and assembly of nanographenes by embedding the topological defects to afford two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals on surfaces is still a great challenge. By in&#8208;situ embedding ladder bipyrazinylene (LBPy) into acene, the narrowest nanographene with zigzag edges, we have achieved the precise preparation of 2D nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals on Au(111). Through intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2 + 2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and lead to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds. Using bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we determined the atomic structures of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene product and diverse organometallic intermediates. The tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed the electronic structure of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene, which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed distinct organometallic intermediates during progression annealing combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that LBPy formation proceeds via electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides, trapping of heteroarynes by Au adatoms, and stepwise elimination of Au adatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of direct anchoring sites&#160;for monoatomic dispersion of precious metals (Pt, Pd, Ag) on CeO2 support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoatomic dispersion of precious metals on the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals is a highly practical approach for dramatically reducing the usage of precious metals while exploiting the unique properties of single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, the specific atomic sites for anchoring precious metal atoms on the CeO2 support and underlying chemical mechanism remain partially unknown. Herein, we show that the terminal hydroxyls on the (100) surface are the most stable sites for anchoring Ag atoms on CeO2, indicating that CeO2 nanocubes are the most efficient substrates to achieve monoatomic dispersion of Ag. Importantly, the newly identified chemical mechanism for single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom dispersion on CeO2 nanocubes appears to be generic and can thus be extended to other precious metals (Pt and Pd). In fact, our experiments also show that atomically dispersed Pt/Pd species exhibit morphology&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent CO selectivity in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanophotocatalysis: A Generalizable Approach to Solvent&#8208;minimized Photocatalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study cements the viability and generality of mechanophotocatalysis, merging mechanochemistry and photocatalysis to enable solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalytic reactions. We demonstrate the transmutation of four archetypal solution&#8208;state photocatalysis reactions to a solvent&#8208;minimized environment driven by the combined actions of milling, light, and photocatalysts. The chlorosulfonylation of alkenes and the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones were conducted under solvent&#8208;free conditions with competitive or superior efficiencies to their solution&#8208;state analogues. Furthermore, decarboxylative alkylations are shown to function efficiently under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, while the photoinduced energy transfer promoted [2+2] cycloaddition of chalcone experiences a significant initial rate enhancement over its solution&#8208;state variant. This work serves as a platform for future discoveries in an underexplored field: validating that solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalysis is not only generalizable and competitive with solution&#8208;state photocatalysis, but can also offer valuable advantages.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in&#8208;situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20 cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in&#8208;situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9 times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused Nitrogen Heterocycles by Asymmetric Ring Expansion and Stereochemically Retentive Re&#8208;contraction of Cyclic Ureas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo&#8208;fused nitrogen heterocycles are common features of bioactive molecules, and the enantioselective synthesis of their substituted analogues is an important goal. In this paper we demonstrate a practical and mechanistically intriguing approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;arylbenzazepines and their analogues. The reaction sequence starts with an asymmetric migratory ring expansion of indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, or tetrahydrobenzazepine ureas on treatment with a chiral lithium amide base. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded ureas with acid triggers a two&#8208;atom ring contraction &#8211; an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; in which one urea nitrogen displaces the other &#8211; with almost complete retention of stereochemistry. Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.</dc:description>

Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1-aryl-tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable hydrophobic protrusion was created on Janus particles to regulate the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interactions. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, lead the particle to dock to the membrane, and then draw the whole particle into the cell, improving the efficiencies of both membrane&#8208;anchoring and cellular internalization.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1&#8197;h and be internalized within 24&#8197;h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;A Mitochondrion&#8208;Localized Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitizer Generating Carbon Radicals Against Hypoxic Tumors&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ESR spectra reported in a Research Article by Chao and co&#8208;workers are not in agreement with reactive &#8220;carbon radicals&#8221; claimed to be produced by 730&#8197;nm irradiation of the iridium(III) complex Ir4&#8208;red. The observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects must be induced by other, unidentified reactive intermediates.







Abstract
It is shown that data presented in a paper by Chao and co&#8208;workers do not support the formation of active &#8220;Carbon Radicals&#8221; as claimed according to the title. The assignments of observed ESR spectra and the mechanistic interpretation are severely flawed. Hence, other reactive intermediates must be responsible for the observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects.

         <title>P450&#8208;Modified Multicyclic Cyclophane&#8208;Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified 1,057 putative P450&#8208;modified RiPP gene clusters classified into 11 different clades. Gene clusters from Class&#8197;3 and 9, which encode multiple aromatic amino acids, were selected for heterologous expreesion. A total of 11 P450&#8208;modified multicyclic peptides were successfully characterized, with some containing unusual cyclophane linkers, demonstrating the powerful catalytic capabilities of P450 enzymes.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with cyclophane linkers are an attractive compound type owing to the fine&#8208;tuned rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450&#8208;modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11&#8197;classes. Focusing on two classes of P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring&#8208;forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane&#8208;containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) driven can precisely control phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 quantum wells. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA, acting as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity, facilitates efficient singlet energy transfer (ET) and tailors the luminescent characteristics to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control.







Abstract
The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Initiated Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Polythiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Block Copolymer into Erect Micellar Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of polythiophene&#8208;base block copolymer and further decoration of Pt nanoparticles lead to facile construction of highly erect conjugated micellar brushes on various substrates. Moreover, successive patterned immobilization of two types of seed micelles followed by independently surface&#8208;initiated CDSA allows the growth of patterned dual&#8208;micellar brushes on the same substrate.







Abstract
Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to a surface remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700&#8197;nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without any significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.

Herein, we report a facile method to directly self-assemble a poly(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT-based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface-initiated living crystallization-driven self-assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700&#8197;nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the P3EHT-based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS-based micellar brush on the same surface without any significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site-selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self-assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto D&#8208;serine (DS) or D&#8208;threonine (DT) residues of synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase (L&#8208;OGA) to afford the desired D&#8208;protein targets.







Abstract
D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogenetics is an evolving field in which ultrasound is used for the molecular control of cellular functions at different levels, thereby opening new avenues in biological and medical research. Here we discuss sonogenetic mediators and review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic methods utilizing thermal and mechanical ultrasonic effects as well as mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems and ultrasound biomolecular imaging.







Abstract
Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics&#8212;a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible conversion of sulfur cathodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries is realized by applying the highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 catalyst. Experimental and computational results indicate that abundant iodide ions adsorbed on ZnS nanoparticles surface regulate the d&#8208;band center of Zn, leading to atomic rearrangements, and therefore promoting the electro&#8208;oxidation of ZnS to S.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8&#8197;W&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Accelerating the Reaction Kinetics of CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Synergistic Effect between Cation and Aprotic Solvent on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of cation and aprotic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) in a neutral electrolyte can improve the selectivity of C2+ products for CO2 reduction reaction. Among them, the synergistic effect not only enhances C&#8722;C coupling, but also decreases the water network connectivity &#8208; which suppresses C1 product formation and hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is an important and highly challenging topic. In this work, we propose and validate an effective strategy to improve C2+ selectivity on Cu electrodes, by introducing a synergistic effect between cation (Na+) and aprotic solvent (DMSO) to the electrolyte. Based on constant potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first revealed that Na+ facilitates C&#8722;C coupling while inhibits CH3OH/CH4 products via reducing the water network connectivity near the electrode. Furthermore, the water network connectivity was further decreased by introducing an aprotic solvent DMSO, leading to suppression of both C1 production and hydrogen evolution reaction with minimal effect on *OCCO* hydrogenation. The synergistic effect enhancing C2 selectivity was also experimentally verified through electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Faradaic efficiency of C2 increases from 9.3&#8201;% to 57&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA/cm2 under a mixed electrolyte of NaHCO3 and DMSO compared to a pure NaHCO3, which can significantly enhance the selectivity of the C2 product. Therefore, our discovery provides an effective electrolyte&#8208;based strategy for tuning CO2RR selectivity through modulating the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.

A novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system is established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. Benefiting from the strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities of the Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 cathode, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery displays the highest round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.2&#8201;%) to date, superior rate capability, and stable cycle life of over 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32&#8197;V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (&#8776;500&#8197;h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size of support significantly affects the reaction orientation of the light&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation. Small&#8208;size TiO2 supporting nickel exhibits enhanced metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) and enables more light&#8208;induced electrons on TiO2 to transfer to Ni, thereby accelerating the H2 decomposition and CO2 methanation process.







Abstract
The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with selectivity of 99.8&#8201;%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% with rate of 30.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Engineered Large&#8208;Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of large&#8208;area continuous COF films with controllable thickness and the patterned growth of films are achieved by solid&#8208;liquid interface engineering. The COF films have high crystalline quality and photoelectrochemical performance. When used as an active material for synaptic devices, they show excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties and successfully simulate biological synaptic functions.







Abstract
Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 at 420&#8197;nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.

         <title>In situ Light&#8208;Writable Orientation Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Film Enabled by Chalcones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), where anisotropy can be written by linearly polarized light based on the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction of chalcone mesogens, is accomplished. Importantly, the sophisticated topography changes are realized by implanting regionally distributed anisotropy into LCE sheets.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with intrinsic anisotropy. However, it is still challenging to in situ program the mesogen alignment to realize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) deformations with high&#8208;resolution patterned structures. This work presents a feasible strategy to program the anisotropy of LCEs by using chalcone mesogens that can undergo a photoinduced cycloaddition reaction under linear polarized light. It is shown that by controlling the polarization director and the irradiation region, patterned alignment distribution in a freestanding LCE film can be created, which leads to complex and reversible 3D shape&#8208;morphing behaviors. The work demonstrates an in situ light&#8208;writing method to achieve sophisticated topography changes in LCEs, which has potential applications in encryption, sensors, and beyond.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate ROS to stimulate the TRPA1 channel and realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. At the same time, photothermo&#8208;controlled NO generation could open the RyR channel in the ER and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Through the combination of dual channels, Ca2+ overload would occur in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.

     alt="Photo-Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under near-infrared light irradiation, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; nanomodulator can generate ROS to stimulate the TRPA1 channel and realize Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx from extracellular environments. At the same time, photothermo-controlled NO generation could open the RyR channel in the ER and allow stored Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to leak. Through the combination of dual channels, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload would occur in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing reactive calcium-based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are either overactive incapable of on-demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-regulating channels, a photo-controlled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co-load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal-sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN-6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell-targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near-infrared light irradiation, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN-6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo-controlled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and release could enable Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards a Light&#8208;mediated Gene Therapy for the Eye using Caged Ethinylestradiol and the Inducible Cre/lox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light sensitive caged ethinylestradiol (EE2) was used in combination with the inducible Cre/lox system for photoactivated transgene expression in the living eye. Following intravitreal injection of caged EE2 and irradiation with light at 450&#8197;nm, tdTomato reporter gene expression was robustly induced in retinal tissue.







Abstract
Increasingly, retinal pathologies are being treated with virus&#8208;mediated gene therapies. To be able to target viral transgene expression specifically to the pathological regions of the retina with light, we established an in vivo photoactivated gene expression paradigm for retinal tissue. Based on the inducible Cre/lox system, we discovered that ethinylestradiol is a suitable alternative to Tamoxifen as ethinylestradiol is more amenable to modification with photosensitive protecting compounds, i.e., &#8220;caging.&#8221; Identification of ethinylestradiol as a ligand for the mutated human estradiol receptor was supported by in silico binding studies showing the reduced binding of caged ethinylestradiol. Caged ethinylestradiol was injected into the eyes of double transgenic GFAP&#8208;CreERT2 mice with a Cre&#8208;dependent tdTomato reporter transgene followed by irradiation with light of 450&#8197;nm. Photoactivation significantly increased retinal tdTomato expression compared to controls. We thus demonstrated a first step towards the development of a targeted, light&#8208;mediated gene therapy for the eyes.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrophobic Tri&#8208;layer Interface Rendered Mechanically Graded Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface is developed through the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte design to create stable electrode/electrolyte interface. The OTF&#8208; rich interface facilitates the formation of mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface. As a result, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enabled zinc metal battery stably operation at practical condition and under wide temperature operation.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery is promising as grid scale energy storage device, but hindered by the instable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we report the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte creates the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface assembled by first two layers of hydrophobic OTF&#8722; and EMIM+ and third layer of loosely attached water, beyond the classical Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern theory based electrochemical double layer. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enables a wide electrochemical working window (2.93&#8197;V) with relatively high zinc ion conductivity (17.3&#8197;mS/cm). Furthermore, the anion crowding interface facilitates the OTF&#8722; decomposition chemistry to create the mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface layer to simultaneously suppress the dendrite formation and maintain the mechanical stability. In this way, the lean&#8208;water based ionic liquid electrolyte realizes the ultralong cyclability of over 10000 cycles at 20&#8197;A/g and at practical condition of N/P ratio of 1.5, the cumulated areal capacity reach 1.8&#8197;Ah/cm2, which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc metal battery performance. Our work highlights the importance of the stable electrode/electrolyte interface stability, which would be practical for building high energy grid scale zinc&#8208;ion battery.

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination in organic solar cell molecule yields a breakthrough with the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor BO&#8208;4I, delivering expanded exciton diffusion, improved intra&#8208;moiety excitation, and unprecedentedly low non&#8208;radiative losses, propelling photovoltaic efficiency forward.







Abstract
Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80&#8197;nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189&#8197;eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.

         <title>Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and EmissionRecovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the phase transfer of hydrophobic clusters into the aqueous phase with maintained emission intensities via the supramolecular recoupling of emissive Ag29 nanoclusters with atomic precision.







Abstract
Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains a challenge because of photoluminescence (PL) quenching during phase transfer. In addition, the mechanism underlying PL quenching remains unclear. In this study, the PL&#8208;quenching mechanism was examined by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;functionalized surface. Specifically, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and weakened the radiative transition. Furthermore, emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished by using a supramolecular recoupling approach through the glutathione&#8208;addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motion and intercluster rotation strengthened the radiative transition of the clusters. The results of this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters and hopefully provide insight into the fabrication of highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for downstream hydrophilic applications.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of highly&#8208;substituted alkyl vinyl ethers in a well&#8208;defined configuration is challenging. Now, a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) enabled by dual&#8208;functional Cu catalysis is reported. It also represents a novel ring&#8208;opening pattern involving the cleavage of the C1&#8722;C3 bond in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of highly-substituted alkyl vinyl ethers in a well-defined configuration is challenging. Now, a modular, chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective synthesis of fully-substituted and configuration-defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) enabled by dual-functional Cu catalysis is reported. It also represents a novel ring-opening pattern involving the cleavage of the C1&#8722;C3 bond in &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated cyclopropanes.

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview sums up cutting&#8208;edge concepts regarding the formation of protein&#8208;based supramolecular structures, compartmentalization, and self&#8208;assembly monitoring; it compares the routes of their modifications and applications in multifunctional biomaterial design. We summarize the current knowledge about machine learning/artificial intelligence applications for protein structure prediction/obtainment and link it to biomaterial performance.







Abstract
Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to nanozymes mimicking specific metallocofactors without other supporting cofactors, a metal&#8211;organic framework incorporating multiple nanocofactors demonstrates the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The synergy of the atomic iron sites, linkers and zirconia nodes boosts electron transfer, providing insight into the construction of catalytic pockets at the atomic scale for a deep understanding of nanozyme catalysis.







Abstract
Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide nanoparticles enhanced dendritic cell maturation via intracellular glutathione depletion and subsequent STING pathway activation. Effective antigen delivery and presentation mediated by the nanoparticles significantly triggered antitumor immune response and inhibited tumor growth in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings.







Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reaction&#8208;Enabled Chloride Modification on CsPbI3 Quantum Dots for Pure Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 26&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with a carrier&#8208;confined structure of CsPbI3/PbClx are demonstrated via the nucleophilic reaction during colloidal synthesis. The modification of a PbClx surface outside the CsPbI3 QDs regulates the exciton recombination, enabling high&#8208;performance pure red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, and superior operation stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance pure red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an emission wavelength shorter than 650&#8197;nm are ideal for wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays, yet remain an unprecedented challenge to progress. Mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 emitter&#8208;based PeLEDs suffer spectral stability induced by halide phase segregation and CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) suffer from a compromise between emission wavelength and electroluminescence efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient pure red PeLEDs with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs. A nucleophilic reaction that releases chloride ions and manipulates the ligand equilibrium of the colloidal system is developed to synthesize the pure red emission QDs. The comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterizations evidence the formation of PbClx outside the CsPbI3 QDs, which regulates exciton recombination and prevents the exciton from dissociation induced by surface defects. In consequence, PeLEDs based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs with superior optoelectronic properties demonstrate stable electroluminescence spectra at high driving voltages, a record external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, optimal efficiency roll&#8208;off of 16.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and a half lifetime of 7.5&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs. This work provides new insight into constructing the carrier&#8208;confined structure on perovskite QDs for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lateral heterojunction, fabricated by spatially confined transmetallation of a precursor zinc(II) benzenehexathiolato coordination nanosheet with Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions is reported. Structural differences between the transmetallated and the as&#8208;prepared nanosheets lead to physical and chemical differences. Band structure bending across the interface of the transmetallated nanosheets results in the observed rectifying behavior.







Abstract
Heterostructures of two&#8208;dimensional materials realise novel and enhanced physical phenomena, making them attractive research targets. Compared to inorganic materials, coordination nanosheets have virtually infinite combinations, leading to tunability of physical properties and are promising candidates for heterostructure fabrication. Although stacking of coordination materials into vertical heterostructures is widely reported, reports of lateral coordination material heterostructures are few. Here we show the successful fabrication of a seamless lateral heterojunction showing diode behaviour, by sequential and spatially limited immersion of a new metalladithiolene coordination nanosheet, Zn3BHT, into aqueous Cu(II) and Fe(II) solutions. Upon immersion, the Zn centres in insulating Zn3BHT are replaced by Cu or Fe ions, resulting in conductivity. The transmetallation is spatially confined, occurring only within the immersed area. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point towards exploring transmetallation of various two&#8208;dimensional materials to produce lateral heterojunctions, by providing a new and facile synthetic route.

         <title>Selective Photoelectrochemical Oxidation of Glycerol to Glyceric Acid on (002) Facets Exposed WO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(002) Facets exposed WO3 nanosheets display excellent performance in selective photoelectrochemical oxidization of glycerol to glyceric acid, reaching 73&#8201;% glyceric acid selectivity and 32.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 glyceric acid production at 0.9&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5G illumination.







Abstract
Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value&#8208;added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a 73&#8201;% GLYA selectivity and a 39&#8201;% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselectivity&#8208;tailored, photoenzyme&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of oxalates and oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines was possible by using a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAP variants with excellent selectivity (both giving up to 99&#8201;% e.e., E&gt;200). The enzymes were obtained by focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM)&#8208;guided stereodivergent protein engineering of fatty acid photodecarboxylase.







Abstract
Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R) or (S) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metallo&#8208;cages that combine multiple photosensitizer modules synergistically have been constructed through a simple method using pyrylium&#8208;pyridinium salts and coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Compared with the modules, cages with a porphyrin core exhibit a significant enhancement in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging cancer treatment, requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salt PSs together through condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced by the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with two porphyrin cores shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interactions with lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 has excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this study will enable the development of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.

         <title>Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral&#8208;Inspired Method Integrating First&#8208;Principles High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid&#8208;state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often&#8208;overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba2TiOSi2O7. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb2TeOP2O7 and Rb2SbFP2O7. Notably, Rb2SbFP2O7 demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260 nm) and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.1 &#215; KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546 nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba2TiOSi2O7 (0.005@546 nm). Our research has not only revitalized the potential of the fresnoite mineral for the development of new high&#8208;performance UV nonlinear optical materials but has also provided a clearly defined roadmap for the efficient exploration of novel structure&#8208;driven functional materials with targeted properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Transcytosis&#8208;Based Renal Tubular Reabsorption of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of endogenous proteins is a well&#8208;known energy&#8208;saving pathway that prevents nutrient loss. However, utilization of this well&#8208;known reabsorption pathway for the delivery of exogenous nanodrugs remains a challenge. In this study, using the surface mimic strategy of a specific PEPT1/2&#8208;targeted Gly&#8208;Sar peptide as a ligand, renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (P&#8208;AuNPs) were developed as protein mimics to investigate the transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of exogenous substances. By regulating the influential factors (H+ content in tubular lumens and PEPT1/2 transporter counts in tubular cells) of Gly&#8208;Sar&#8208;mediated transcytosis, the specific and efficient interaction between P&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Efficient transcellular transportation significantly guided the reabsorption of P&#8208;AuNPs back into the bloodstream, which enhanced the blood concentration and bioavailability of nanoparticles, contributing to high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Biology&#8208;based Construction of Unnatural Perylenequinones with Improved Photodynamic Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of structural complexity and diversity of natural products is crucial for drug discovery and development. To overcome high dark toxicity and poor photostability of natural photosensitizer perylenequinones (PQs) for photodynamic therapy, herein, we aim to introduce the structural complexity and diversity to biosynthesize the desired unnatural PQs in fungus Cercospora through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Thus, we first elucidate the intricate biosynthetic pathways of class B PQs and reveal how the branching enzymes create their structural complexity and diversity from a common ancestor. This enables the rational reprogramming of cercosporin biosynthetic pathway in Cercospora to generate diverse unnatural PQs without chemical modification. Among them, unnatural cercosporin A displays remarkably low dark toxicity and high photostability with retention of great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover,&#160;it is found that, unlike cercosporin, the unnatural cercosporin A could be selectively accumulated in cancer cells, providing potential targets for drug development. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for preparing unnatural products with customized functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies, thus facilitating drug discovery pipelines from nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Disproportionation&#8208;Mediated Photodynamic Therapy: Simultaneous Oxidation of Tetrahydrobiopterin and Generation of Superoxide Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein present an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. As a proof of concept, BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers were rationally designed and prepared. The photo&#8208;induced intermolecular electron transfer between homotypic chromophores leads to the disproportionation reaction, resulting in the formation of charged intermediates, cationic and anionic radicals. The cationic radicals efficiently oxidize the cellar important coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the anionic radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;). One of our Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents that not only self&#8208;assembles in water but also effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum. It displayed excellent photocytotoxicity even in highly hypoxic environments (2% O2), with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.96 &#956;M, and demonstrated outstanding antitumor efficacy in murine models bearing HeLa tumors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic breakthroughs diversify the molecules and polymers available to chemists. We now report the first successful synthesis of a series of optically&#8208;pure 2,2&#180;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded helical ladder polymers based on quantitative and chemoselective ladderization by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source, inaccessible by the conventional approach lacking the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents. Due to the defect&#8208;free helix formation, the circular dichroism signal increased by more than 6 times the previously reported value. The resulting helical secondary structure can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle in the repeating unit with variations in the 2,2&#180;&#8208;alkylenedioxy tethering groups by one carbon atom at a time. The optimization of the helical ladder structures led to a strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high fluorescence quantum yield (28%) and luminescence dissymmetry factor (2.6 &#215; 10&#8211;3).</dc:description>

         <title>H* Species Regulation by Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 for Efficient Nitrate Electro&#8208;Reduction in Neutral Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrocatalytic NO3&#8208; reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) under neutral condition, the activation of H2O to generate H* and the inhibition of inter&#8208;H* species binding, are critically important but remain challenging for suppressing the non&#8208;desirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Mn&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 (named as Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2) has been synthesized by in situ reconstruction in the electrolyte, which is able to dissociate H2O molecules but inhibits the binding of H* species between each other owing to the increased interatomic spacing by the Mn&#8208;doping. The Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst offers a faradaic efficiency (FE) of as high as 98.9 &#177; 1.7% at &#8208;0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an energy efficiency (EE) of 49.90 &#177; 1.03% for NH3 production by NO3&#8208;RR, which are among the highest of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, negligible degradation at &#8208;200 mA cm&#8208;2 has been found for at least 500 hours, which is the longest catalytic durations ever reported. This work paves a novel approach for the design and synthesis of efficient NO3&#8208;RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable Engineering of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Inducible DNAzyme Probe for In Situ Imaging of Nuclear Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescence probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three&#8208;stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20&#8208;base pair recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in&#8208;situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;inducible imaging of nuclear Zn2+ is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR&#8208;DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was highlighted by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn2+ in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new perspectives to nuclear metal&#8208;associated biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV&#8208;Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8208;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A methanol-based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite-catalyzed methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM-5, the practical application of this process in a CO2-neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM-5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch-carbonylation-led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady-state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV-Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid-state NMR spectroscopic-based investigations on the MTH process, involving co-feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch-carbonylated species), including selective isotope-labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch-)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side-chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene-toluene-xylene) primarily.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive &#945;&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Carbonyl Addition of Ketimine to Construct the &#946;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Transformed Ag2Te Nanowires on Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane For Flexible Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge. &#160;We are reporting a flexible thermoelectric module prepared from silver telluride (Ag2Te) nanowires (NWs), which are chemically transformed from uniquely synthesized and scalable tellurium (Te) NWs. Conducting Ag2Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~ 0.22 W/mK surpassing the bulk melt&#8208;grown Ag2Te ~ 1.23 W/mK at ~ 300 K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n&#8208;type) of Ag2Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (Voc) ~ 2.3 mV upon human touch and Voc ~ 18 mV at temperature gradient, DT ~ 50 K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8208; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn&#448;&#448;Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500 h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200 cycles at ~99.8% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery (~5.6 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2), cycling over 320 cycles with 95.3% initial capacity retained.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8208;7 &#8211; 10&#8208;10 Scm&#8208;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface&#8208;anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs&#8208;based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs&#8208;based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triply Linked Porphyrin&#8722;Norcorrole Hybrid with Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Norcorrole Ni(II) complexes have recently received considerable attention because they are readily accessible antiaromatic molecules. Their high stability under ambient conditions and ease of synthesis have enabled the exploration of the intrinsic properties of antiaromatic molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of&#160;meso&#8722;meso&#160;singly linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrids&#160;and a triply linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrid. The singly linked and triply linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrids were fully characterized, including an X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Due to their orthogonal conformation, the singly linked hybrids maintain the individual electronic properties of their porphyrin and norcorrole subunits, while the triply linked hybrid shows a significantly smaller electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45 eV) than that of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole (1.08 eV). Furthermore, the triply linked hybrid exhibits singlet diradical characteristics, as confirmed by VT&#8208;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic Ketones as Mild Presodiating Reagents toward Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.</dc:description>

However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over-sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9-Fluorenoneb (9-FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9-FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Global Reactivity Profiling of the Catalytic Lysine in Human Kinome for Covalent Inhibitor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine&#8208;reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell&#8208;active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; 2&#8208;14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase&#8208;binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase. Chemoproteomic studies enabled the profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases, thus providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the kinome. By further introducing these aminophiles into VX&#8208;680 (a noncovalent inhibitor of AURKA kinase), we generated novel lysine&#8208;reactive TCIs that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and reasonable cellular activities with prolonged residence time. Our work serves as a general guide for the development of lysine&#8208;reactive ArOSO2F&#8208;based TCIs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in&#8208;situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8208;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and good stability (144 h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8722;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710 nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8722;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8722;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30 min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal&#8722;liquid&#8722;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Better Aptamers: Structured Library Approaches, Selection Methods, and Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been used to discover thousands of aptamers since its development in 1990. Aptamers are short single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding to targets with high specificity and selectivity through structural recognition. While aptamers offer advantages over other molecular recognition elements in their ease of production, smaller size, extended shelf&#8208;life, and lower immunogenicity, they have yet to show significant success in real&#8208;world applications. By analyzing the importance of structured library designs, reviewing different SELEX methodologies, and the effects of chemical modifications, we provide a comprehensive overview on the production of aptamers for applications in drug delivery systems, therapeutics, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered anchor peptide LCI with a cobalt cofactor enhances oxidation efficiency of polystyrene microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the polarity and reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on an engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8208;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD = 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mobility Emissive Excimer Organic Semiconductor Towards Color&#8208;tunable Light&#8208;emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors  simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16 cm2&#183;V&#8208;1&#183;s&#8208;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLET for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa = 8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C = cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld = chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04 V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0 M KOH + 10.0 M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3 V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#183;&#183;&#183;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6 V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000 cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene. In contrast, the radical cation (1&#8226;+&#183;SbCl6&#8208;) possesses a doubly twisted H&#252;ckel topology. Furthermore, the dication (12+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) displays conformational flexibility in solution and crystalizes with the simultaneous presence of M&#246;bius&#8208;twisted (1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) and H&#252;ckel&#8208;planar (1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) isomers in its unit cell. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: (1) 1 demonstrates localized aromaticity with an alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure; (2) 1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; and 1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; with 48&#960; electrons are weakly M&#246;bius aromatic and H&#252;ckel antiaromatic, respectively; (3) 14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208; exhibits H&#252;ckel aromaticity (46&#960;) and open&#8208;shell diradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8208;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8208;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8208;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8208;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8208;COFs into BO&#8208;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8208;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum sulfur (Al&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8208;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8208;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8208;/Al2Cl7&#8208; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8208;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8208;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8208;20 to 40 &#176;C. For instance, Al&#8208;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 20 &#176;C, while only 229 mAh g&#8208;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aluminum sulfur (Al-S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al-S batteries, especially at sub-zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non-solvating 1,2-difluorobenzene (dFBn) co-solvent are proposed for wide-temperature-range Al-S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4-/Al2Cl7- equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al-S batteries. As a result, Al-S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from -20 to 40 &#176;C. For instance, Al-S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 20 &#176;C, while only 229 mAh g-1 is delivered with the dFBn-free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide-temperature Al-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. &#160;Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide solid electrolytes receiving less attention.&#160; Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. &#160;Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x = 2, 3, 4, or 9). &#160;Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. &#160;By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#8451; for Li4YI7.&#160; Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. &#160;Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659 nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Position of Ester Group on N&#8208;Alkyl Chains of Benzotriazole&#8208;based Small Molecule Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6:BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8722;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the critical role of vertical displacement of Fe atom, which can be modulated by defect engineering, in tuning the electron structure and stabilizing the transition state of rate&#8208;determining step, and demonstrates that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity is determined by the flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site, which is further affected by the Fe&#8722;N bond length. Importantly, this simple geometric parameter is tunable and readily probed experimentally.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of M&#8722;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density&#8208;functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N3 distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.

Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density-functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high-performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To flow or not to flow ? Assessing feasibility and guiding chemists with a priori computational intelligence for reaction optimization under continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, to provide mechanistic insight, to contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>

The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity. Recently, it has been shown that doping with oxophilic elements can significantly alleviate these problems, with a prominent example being Mo&#8208;doped Pt alloys. Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties. Beginning with the Mo/Pt system, we demonstrate that Mo can be stabilized in the form of low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide moieties on Pt defects. The resulting structures enhance stability and activity via distinct physical processes, with the Mo moieties both directly inhibiting Pt dissolution at defects and indirectly enhancing ORR activity by generation of strain fields on surrounding Pt terraces. We then generalize these analyses to other metal dopant elements, and we demonstrate that similar low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide structures control the electrocatalytic properties through an intricate interplay of the structures&#8217; acid stability, intrinsic activity for the ORR, and ability to induce ORR&#8208;promoting strain fields on Pt.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated &#8220;functionalization&#8208;defunctionalization&#8221; approach efficiently produces bio&#8208;based surfactants directly from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The performance of the resulting sugar and lignin&#8208;based surfactants are competitive with existing commercial products, highlighting the potential for using these biomass fractions as surfactants with minimal structural modification.







Abstract
Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29&#8201;% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80&#8201;% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

Stable single Ru atoms on the surface of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948; (SDC) could evidently modify the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathodic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation is essential for high-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sm&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal-support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SDC-La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high-temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes Involving in Situ&#8208;Generated &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal aryl alkynes with sulfilimines was achieved. It proceeds via an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization or Pictet&#8211;Spengler reactions to selectively form fused indoles. The formation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles and imidazoles derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization is also presented.







Abstract
An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, facilitating the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Intermediates adsorbed on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species in the CH4 production from CO2 form are more thermodynamically favorable. The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH4 selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH4 production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), over ten times of that for CN.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal allows post&#8208;translational bromination of a tetrapeptide tag with C&#8208;terminal tryptophan in proteins on a preparative scale using the brominating E. coli coexpression strain Brocoli. The bromoarene can be derivatized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at 37&#8201;&#176;C. This opens new avenues for bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of proteins by biocatalytic bromination of minimally tagged proteins.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for the modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. By a semirational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays, leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression system Brocoli. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved with Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bio&#8208;orthogonal functionalization and conjugation.

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li2S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li2S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.







Abstract
The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;), as both e&#8208;/Li+ donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long&#8208;range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (S) and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2-tertbutyl-semianthraquinone lithium (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;TBAQ&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), as both e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;TBAQ&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid-solid reaction by promoting long-range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is the rate-limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;TBAQ&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;TBAQ&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>One Collision&#8212;Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl radical with C5H8 isomers (2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, 1,3&#8208;pentadiene). Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.







Abstract
The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics&#8212;xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2)&#8212;in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10&#8197;K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8208;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H2 dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (Had) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdHx (PdHab) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&#8722; to form water.







Abstract
Tracking the trajectory of hydrogen intermediates during hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis is beneficial for designing synergetic multi&#8208;component catalysts with division of chemical labor. Herein, we demonstrate a novel dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism that leads to two orders of magnitude increase in the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity on Pd@Pt over pure Pd, even &#8776;31.8&#8197;times mass activity enhancement than commercial Pt. Specifically, the polarization&#8208;driven electrochemical hydrogenation process from Pd@Pt to PdHx@Pt by incorporating LH allows more surface vacancy Pt sites to increase the surface H coverage. The inverse dehydrogenation process makes PdHx as an H reservoir, providing LH migrates to the surface of Pt and participates in the HOR. Meanwhile, the formation of PdHx induces electronic effect, lowering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining Volmer step, thus resulting in the HOR kinetics on Pd@Pt being proportional to the LH concentration in the in situ formed PdHx@Pt. Moreover, this dynamic catalysis mechanism would open up the catalysts scope for hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

         <title>Versatile Neuromorphic Modulation and Biosensing based on N&#8208;type Small&#8208;molecule Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type semiconductor&#8208;based organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS) enables superior synapse characteristics in a single device with an unprecedented combination of facile fabrication, excellent ambient stability, and robust and flexible tunability. The OENS was used as a biosensor to detect dopamine at sub&#8208;micromolar level in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.

         <title>Unraveling Dynamic Helicity Inversion and Chirality Transfer through the Synthesis of Discrete Azobenzene Oligomers by an Iterative Exponential Growth Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete azooligomers and their corresponding assemblies were synthesized by an iterative exponential growth strategy involving dynamic helicity inversion and chirality transfer. The interconversion of H&#8208;aggregates and J&#8208;aggregates in discrete azooligomer assemblies results in different helicity reversals and morphological transitions.







Abstract
Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial for exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, and it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

A novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP) is designed to effectively suppress the HF generation and facilitate the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer, empowering NCM811/S650 full cells with enhanced cycle life and thermal safety.







Abstract
High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode /electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8722;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.

         <title>Photocatalytic Production of Ethanolamines and Ethylenediamines from Bio&#8208;Polyols over a Cu/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 catalyst with multiple active sites was developed to produce ethanolamines and ethylenediamines from bio&#8208;polyols via a photocatalytic process in one pot. Oxidation by photogenerated holes over TiO2 was responsible for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyols, and metallic copper was active for reductive amination via self&#8208;hydrogen transfer. It affords a novel strategy for biomass conversion to aminated compounds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethanolamines and ethylenediamines is highly attractive. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step photocatalytic protocol to convert bio&#8208;polyols into a 60&#8201;% yield of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines over a multifunctional Cu/TiO2 catalyst. This catalyst enables a tandem process of photocatalytic polyol C&#8722;C bond cleavage and reductive amination in one pot at room temperature, and also allows the selective conversion of various bio&#8208;polyols and amines. Mechanistic studies revealed that photogenerated holes in TiO2 promote the retro&#8208;aldol C&#8722;C bond cleavage or oxidative dehydrogenation of polyols, and photogenerated electrons accumulate on small&#8208;sized Cu clusters, which facilitate the reductive amination via hydrogen transfer and prevent the H2 generation. This strategy provides new opportunities for the development of non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts and methods of biomass conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting homopolymer, hailing from an electron&#8208;rich peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic monomer, produces uniform films with heightened hole mobility, amplified modulus, and constrained species diffusion. These attributes enable the construction of perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, which also exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational durability.







Abstract
Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7&#8201;% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#8201;&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, rivaling 24.4&#8201;% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational robustness.

         <title>A Fully Amorphous, Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linked Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Operating at Subzero&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a fully amorphous quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a dynamic cross&#8208;linked network composed of a star&#8208;shaped plasticising polymer and a linear poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The electrolyte achieves high Li+ conductivity (2.96&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high tLi+ (0.81), and the as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit high reversible capacity and long cycle life when operating at subzero temperature conditions.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.

Insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) enable robust targeted degradation of pathogenic membrane proteins and allow simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins.







Abstract
Overexpression of pathogenic membrane proteins drives abnormal proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Various strategies to durably knockdown membrane proteins with heterobifunctional degraders have been successfully developed, including LYTAC, KineTAC, and AbTAC. However, challenges including complicated synthetic procedures and the inability to simultaneously degrade multiple pathogenic proteins still exist. Herein, we developed insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) that link the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;targeting receptor IGF2R and membrane proteins of interest (POIs) based on specific recognition of aptamers to the POIs and high&#8208;affinity binding of IGF2 to IGF2R. We demonstrated that ITACs exhibit robust degradation efficiency of various membrane proteins in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed that a moderate cell&#8208;surface IGF2R level is responsible for the excellent degradation performance of ITACs. Importantly, we further established a modular assembly strategy that allows assembly of one IGF2 with two aptamers with precise stoichiometry (dITACs), enabling cooperative and simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins. This work provides an efficient and facile target membrane protein degradation platform and will shed light on the treatment of diseases related to the overexpression of membrane proteins.

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li2O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li2O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.







Abstract
Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li-ion battery full-cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy-density and cycle-life of practical Li-ion battery full-cell, especially after employing high-capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, obtaining (Li&lt;sub&gt;0.66&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.11&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.23&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co-derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g&lt;sub&gt;~Li2O&lt;/sub&gt; prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO-based prelithiation agent with LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch-type full-cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodonium Initiators: Paving the Air&#8208;free Oxidation of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties were designed to replace lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine in doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), which can oxidize Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance. The devices based on this oxidizing Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.







Abstract
To date, perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) with doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) hole transporting layers (HTLs) have shown the highest recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, their commercialization is still impeded by poor device stability owing to the hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and volatile 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine dopants as well as time&#8208;consuming oxidation in air. In this study, we explored a series of single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties to precisely manipulate the oxidation states of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance, and the oxidation mechanism was clearly understood. Iodine (III) in the diphenyliodonium cation (IP+) can accept a single electron from Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and forms Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ owing to its strong oxidability. Moreover, because of the coordination of the strongly delocalized TFSI&#8722; with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ in a stable radical complex, the resulting hole mobility was 30&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. In addition, the IP&#8208;TFSI initiator facilitated the growth of a homogeneous and pinhole&#8208;free Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD film. The pero&#8208;SCs based on this oxidizing HTL showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Coordinated W2S3 for Efficient Dual&#8208;pH Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 crystal has been reported based on the theoretical structure prediction in combination with experimental results. For application in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,PEM=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,AEM=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM, 360 h@AEM).







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that play a crucial role in renewable energy technologies. Breaking the inherent structural paradigm limitations of 2D TMDs is the key to exploring their fascinating physical and chemical properties, which is expected to develop a revolutionary HER catalyst. Herein, we unambiguously present metallic W2S3 instead of energetically favorable WS2 via a unique stoichiometric growth strategy. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity of the tetra&#8208;coordinated structure, as well as an appropriate Gibbs free energy value and an enough low energy barrier for water dissociation, the W2S3 as catalyst achieves Pt&#8208;like HER activity and high long&#8208;term stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;
=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;
=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM with a decay rate of 85.7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1, 360 h@AEM with a decay rate of 27.1&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our work provides significant insight into the tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 and facilitates the development of advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamide functionalization of a green light&#8208;sensitive photoactivated chemotherapy agent based on ruthenium fine&#8208;tuned its excited states, dramatically improving red light absorption. The new prodrug inhibited microtubule polymerization under red light activation, efficiently killing cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, red light activation shrank non&#8208;melanoma skin tumors in mice, while in the dark the prodrug showed improved biosafety.







Abstract
Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine &#960; system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630&#8197;nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21&#8201;% O2) and hypoxic (1&#8201;% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45&#8201;%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new phosphine oxide based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton is demonstrated with CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO featuring highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, whose device achieved narrow&#8208;band emissions with peaks at &#8776;380&#8197;nm and full widths at half maximum of &#8776;30&#8197;nm, and especially record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies beyond 15&#8201;%.







Abstract
Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400&#8197;nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50&#8197;nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390&#8197;nm and FWHM&lt;35&#8197;nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62&#8201;% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <title>Soccer Ball&#8208;like Assembly of Edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge Oriented 2D&#8208;silica Nanosheets: A Promising Catalyst Support for High&#8208;Temperature Reforming</title>

         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;silica nanosheets undergo edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge oriented interlocking and self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like hollow shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The mechanically robust SA&#8208;SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal&#8208;catalysts for high&#8208;temperature methane reforming.







Abstract
Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well&#8208;defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D&#8208;nanomaterialsin self&#8208;assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties. This research unveils the discovery of controlled self&#8208;assembly of 2D&#8208;silica nanosheets (2D&#8208;SiNSs) into hollow micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The assembly is driven by the physical flexibility of the 2D&#8208;SiNSs and the differential electricdouble&#8208;layer charge gradient creating electrostatic bias on the edge and face regions. The resulting SA&#8208;SiMS structures exhibit high mechanical stability, even at high&#8208;temperatures, and exhibit excellent performance as catalyst support in the dry reforming of methane. The SA&#8208;SiMS structures facilitate improved mass transport, leading to enhanced reaction rates, while the thin silica shell prevents sintering of small catalyst nanocrystals, thereby preventing coke formation. This discovery sheds light on the controllable self&#8208;assembly of 2D nanomaterials and provides insights into the design and synthesis of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partially ion&#8208;paired solvation structure design is demonstrated that combines the beneficial characteristics of contact&#8208;ion pair (CIP) and solvent&#8208;separated ion pair (SSIP) structures. A facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anion/fluorinated co&#8208;solvent for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity, effectively expanding the operational capabilities of lithium batteries under extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li&#8201;||&#8201;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) at &#8722;40, 23 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

Zn species evaporated from ZnO particles can migrate and deposit onto Cu surface to form Zn oxide (ZnOx) encapsulation layers i.e., strong metal&#8208;support interaction state under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C in ZnO||Cu catalyst. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species and growth of ZnOx overlayer on Cu surface is self&#8208;limited, which constructs an optimal number of ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites to have enhanced methanol synthesis activity.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) were employed as building blocks for crafting optical communicating assemblies. This approach relies on the selective functionalization of CNDs with clickable moieties and their subsequent controlled interconnection. This work provides new insights on the link between molecular and nanoscale events, paving the way to develop selective and addressable CNDs that can act as modular nanoscale synthons.







Abstract
The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material's outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.

         <title>A donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymer for fast storage of anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer is reported, showing narrower band gap and higher electrical conductivity than its counterparts monopolymers and therefore excellent rate performance. Our findings provide a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.

         <title>Adaptive and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new water&#8208;soluble corral&#8208;shaped conjugated host bearing ten sulfate groups at its two rims&#8212;namely, SC[5]A&#8212;was synthesized. SC[5]A not only exhibited ultrahigh binding affinities (up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards a series of rod&#8208;shaped substrates, but also effectively bound (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) a wide range of functional substrates. Additionally, the application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide was explored.







Abstract
The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owing to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). Additionally, we've explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>

The development of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) nano&#8208;probes with long emission wavelength faces challenges. In this work, organic RTP materials with near&#8208;infrared emission have been designed and cell membrane encapsulation has been used to optimize the nanomaterial process, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and imaging penetration depth.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap may increase the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. In this study, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength emissive RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764&#8197;nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime organic RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy has been developed for preparation of polydienes with high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and end&#8208;group functionalization efficiency. This approach utilizes a novel catalytic system in which allylic&#8208;Al moiety exhibits remarkable selectivity for alkylation and transalkylation and improves the end&#8208;group functionality efficiency for polydiene synthesis, showcasing its immense potential for development of advanced polymeric materials.







Abstract
There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99&#8201;%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than that of the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.

         <title>Chemical Engineering of Artificial Transcription Factors by Orthogonal Palladium(II)&#8208;Mediated S&#8208;Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site&#8208;selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Asp1 and Asp7 in laspartomycin coordinate with a calcium cation to adopt the active conformation. When these residues were replaced by serine, calcium dependence was eliminated and the resulting synthetic analogue depended instead on phenylboronic acid for its antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show modes of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analogue (B1) whose activity no longer depends on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor it in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in B1 and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrate that B1 inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC, i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate. B1 is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemming from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li-ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation-electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; stemming from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion-reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially-Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation-electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) shift to insoluble solid Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is worth highlighting that the Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation does not extra-consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of dienyl sulfoxides were accomplished with up to 98&#8201;% ee from both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters employing cheap Ni(II) as precatalyst. Experimental and computational methods revealed an interesting associated outersphere mechanism which is uncommon in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic nucleophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98&#8201;% ee. The product exhibits tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated anilines are directly synthesised via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand/norbornene cooperative catalysis without the need for additional synthetic steps. This method can be applied to a wide variety of aniline derivatives to provide a unique method for their direct meta&#8208;arylation. The isolation of several Pd complexes provides some useful insights into the factors influencing the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the norbornene&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable numbers of B atoms in the linkages have first been achieved to construct the catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction. The COFs with high contents of the B atoms showed improved the activity and selectivity, due to more easily formation of the intermediate COOH*.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a series of tetrel sandwich complexes characterized by ten &#960;&#8208;electrons ([Li6]5+[E5]10&#8722;[Li6]5+). These complexes are both thermochemically and kinetically stable and exhibit &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
When (4n +2) &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of D5h&#8197;Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8722; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.

&lt;p&gt;When (4n +2) &#960;-electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;-electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5h&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;-electrons E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;-electrons localize as five &#960;-lone-pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;-aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li3PW12O4o electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost&#8208;effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The lithium&#8208;metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium&#8208;air batteries operate over 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8208;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique gfc net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1&#8208;periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 44 (3,3) and in the RCSR database as qbe, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C3H8/C3H6 separation potential.







Abstract
The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography.

     alt="Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique &lt;b&gt;gfc&lt;/b&gt; net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1-periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 4&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (3,3) and in the RCSR database as &lt;b&gt;qbe&lt;/b&gt;, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; separation potential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod-shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu-MOF (Cu-ASY) incorporating infinite Cu-carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing &lt;b&gt;qbe&lt;/b&gt; tubule made of [4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5-connected &lt;b&gt;gfc&lt;/b&gt; net. Cu-ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) over propene (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). The efficiency of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; selective Cu-ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; productivity of 2.2&#8197;L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; molecules form multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and atypical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901; H&#8722;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces.

Nanochannels with spatiotemporal continuity were found to exist in columnar liquid crystals composed of shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic molecules as reported by Kentaro Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316523). The results of 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of the liquid crystal under Xe atmosphere indicate the encapsulation of Xe gas atoms within the discrete and oriented nanochannels of the nanoporous liquid crystals.

Round and round The intrinsic dynamics of small&#8208;molecule ligands while bound to their protein targets is of interest for optimization of the entropic contributions to binding affinity. In their Communication (e202313947), Rasmus Linser et&#8197;al. show that NMR proton relaxation dispersion is able to capture an aromatic ring flip within a high&#8208;affinity pharmacological inhibitor on the &#181;s timescale.

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self&#8208;assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.







Abstract
Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous&#8208;forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.

Human&#8208;AI collaborative platform is described for synergistic design&#8208;synthesis&#8208;analysis workflow of SAHCs by integration of human&#8208;led atomistic insights with data&#8208;driven augmented toolbox towards accomplishing ultimate reality&#8208;enabled SAHCs manufacturing with atomic economy.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.

         <title>Locally Ordered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) exhibit remarkable potential in revolutionizing the limitations of SACs. To date, no review has comprehensively summarized this intriguing topic. This minireview focuses on the compelling characteristics, synthetic strategies, characterization methods, and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100&#8201;% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism. In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Effects of Iron Species on Low Temperature CO2 Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;species will likely be present in large&#8208;scale systems, e.g. from steel components or contaminated electrolytes, so their role in low temperature CO2 electrolyzers must be understood. While they reportedly accelerate degradation of the polymer membrane and the CO2 reduction catalyst, they also enhance the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. We use this duplicity to stress the need for holistic research of complex electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical energy conversion devices are considered key in reducing CO2 emissions and significant efforts are being applied to accelerate device development. Unlike other technologies, low temperature electrolyzers have the ability to directly convert CO2 into a range of value&#8208;added chemicals. To make them commercially viable, however, device efficiency and durability must be increased. Although their design is similar to more mature water electrolyzers and fuel cells, new cell concepts and components are needed. Due to the complexity of the system, singular component optimization is common. As a result, the component interplay is often overlooked. The influence of Fe&#8208;species clearly shows that the cell must be considered holistically during optimization, to avoid future issues due to component interference or cross&#8208;contamination. Fe&#8208;impurities are ubiquitous, and their influence on single components is well&#8208;researched. The activity of non&#8208;noble anodes has been increased through the deliberate addition of iron. At the same time, however, Fe&#8208;species accelerate cathode and membrane degradation. Here, we interpret literature on single components to gain an understanding of how Fe&#8208;species influence low temperature CO2 electrolyzers holistically. The role of Fe&#8208;species serves to highlight the need for considerations regarding component interplay in general.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling.

     alt="Nucleic Acid-based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural micro- and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;free photochemical method for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 is reported for the first time. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives and the synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs.







Abstract
Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one notable methodology to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.

         <title>Microsecond Timescale Conformational Dynamics of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand within the Active Site of a Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid&#8208;state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.







Abstract
The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#956;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase&#8197;II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand's benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;Diketones Catalyzed by Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 was accomplished under the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis, delivering 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with &gt;99/1 dr values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities, while silane PhSiH3 facilitates an intramolecular hydrosilylation of the second carbonyl group.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of 1,2&#8208;diketones for the synthesis of optically active 1,2&#8208;diols, especially 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe the first highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 by using a chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, giving a variety of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with excellent d.r. values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivites concurrently.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot.

     alt="Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem-Difluoroalkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes under oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl-olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one-pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of one-pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl-olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine-promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding saturated fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst and represents the first unactivated carboxamide deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective transformation.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation represents the first strong activating group&#8208;free activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylboration of Alkenes Enabled by Dual Photoredox and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a radical&#8208;based three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis. This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.







Abstract
A regioselectivity reversed three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene&#8208;tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish gem&#8208;difluoromethylene&#8208;containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, providing a wide range of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield.

         <title>One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles: A Straightforward Access to 3&#8208;Fluorinated Quinolines and Pyridines</title>

         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources make one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles facile, allowing for direct access to structurally diverse azines, especially the pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol features bench&#8208;stable reagents, a broad range of substrates, and good compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under air atmosphere. Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources.

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ion dissolution from the cathode, migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the anode is one of the leading causes of cell failure when cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries to high potentials (&gt;4.2&#8197;V). To better understand what is occurring in the electrolyte, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni that has dissolved into the electrolyte from commonly used cathodes.







Abstract
Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3*(1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.

While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LMO), LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO), LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NMC811), and (x Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;*(1-x) LiNi&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with a+b+&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDY) with clear structure and tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. Due to its rich microporous structure, the electron deficiency of the TAB group and the electron richness of the acetylene bond, TAB&#8208;GDY exhibits certain IAST selectivity in binary gas and is expected to be used for gas capture and separation.







Abstract
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.

         <title>Catalytic HF Shuttling between Fluoroalkanes and Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method to transfer formal equivalents of HF from fluoroalkanes to an alkyne is reported. The method leads to a simple approach generating geminal difluoroalkanes and it tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) was shown to act as an HF donor in place of the fluoroalkane.







Abstract
In this paper, we report BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).

         <title>&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Allylation of Trialkylamines with Allenes Promoted by Synergistic Borane/Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation reactions of trialkylamines with allenes were accomplished by a synergistic borane/palladium catalysis. The borane and palladium catalysts promoted the formation of an enamine intermediate from a trialkylamine and a palladium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate from an allene, respectively.







Abstract
Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8722;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed as a host to confine charged iodine species. The robust physicochemical adsorption between cCNF and polyiodides effectively mitigated the shuttle effect and increased iodine loading, resulting in enhanced cycling stability and high energy density even at elevated temperatures, thereby demonstrating promising performance at the full&#8208;battery level.







Abstract
High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, high areal capacity of 2.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.







Abstract
Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.

         <title>Metal Vapour Synthesis of an Organometallic Barium(0) Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over half a century, Mg(anthracene) has been a well&#8208;known complex that reacts as a form of &#8220;atomic&#8221; Mg0, however, heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metal anthracene complexes are unknown. Reaction of Ba0 vapour with an anthracene ligand gave a Ba anthracene complex that crystallizes as a cyclic octamer and reacts as a Ba0 synthon.







Abstract
A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8242;&#8242;2&#8722; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph2C=NPh, or H2 show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.
