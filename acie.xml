         <title>Spatially Confined Intervention of Cellular Senescence by a Lysosomal Metabolism Targeting Molecular Prodrug for Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#160;Senotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific intervention of senescent cells (SnCs) is emerging as a powerful means to counteract aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Canonical methods are generally designed to target SnC&#8208;associated signaling pathways, which are however dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous in SnCs, significantly limiting the effectiveness. Here, we present a tailor&#8208;made molecular prodrug targeting lysosome dysfunction, a unique feature shared by virtually all types of SnCs.The prodrug comprises three modules all targeting the altered lysosomal programs in SnCs, namely, a recognizing unit towards the elevated lysosome content, a linker cleavable by the activated lysosomal enzyme, and a lysosomotropic agent targeting the increased lysosomal membrane sensitivity. This spatially confined design enables killing broad&#8208;spectrum SnCs, with high specificity over non&#8208;SnCs. Along with in vivo benefits, this work offers a way to significantly expand the applicability of senotherapy in a wide range of diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescent 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Iridium Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescent iridium&#8208;based sensors which demonstrate oxygen&#8208;dependent responses have been developed. The molecular probes, named  IrCL&#8208;1  ,  IrCL&#8208;2  and  IrCL&#8208;3  consist of oxygen sensitive iridium complexes attached to a spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane and operate via energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the corresponding iridium (III) complex. Complexing the iridium (III) center with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands results in emission in the biologically relevant, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. All probes demonstrate varying oxygen tolerance, with  IrCL&#8208;1  being the most oxygen sensitive. These probes have been further utilized for  in vitro  ratiometric imaging of oxygen, as well as for intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intratumoral imaging in live mice. To our knowledge, these are the first iridium&#8208;based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for  in vitro  ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for  in vivo  tumor imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8208;Polymer Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8208;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly in Living Cells.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular interactions rely on the noncovalent forces, such as hydrophobic effect, H&#8208;bonding, and electrostatic interaction, which govern many intracellular biological pathways. In cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, mainly includes host&#8208;guest interaction, pH, enzymes and polymerization induce self&#8208;assembly, which accurately introduce a variety of unnatural reactions without interfering with natural biological processes. This process can finely produce synthetic biocompatible macromolecules to control the cell attitudes and regulate biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on the latest update and anticipates the future advance of the in cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and its activation upon response to internal and external stimuli, such as intracellular overexpressed in acidity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes, as well as the use of external light illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of p&#8208;xylene from methanol to aromatics reaction is challenging. By now, the catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is always not compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (~30 nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (~20 nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100% methanol conversion &gt; 40 h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of ~90%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Systematic Understanding of the Influence of Temperature on Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosylating agents. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosylating agent (building block) usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8216;ramp&#8217; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H 2&#160; B(pz)(pypz)) 2&#160; ] (py = pyridine, pz = pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at&#160; &#8776;&#160; 5 K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to&#160; S&#160; =&#160; 1 / 2&#160; and&#160; 3 / 2&#160; spin states of the Co 2+&#160; complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical control of a mitotic kinesin, Eg5, was achieved through an azobenzene analog of EMD&#8208;534085. Under UV light conditions, HeLa cells undergo mitotic arrest, as evidenced by the formation of a monopolar spindle.







Abstract
Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound Azo&#8208;EMD is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased the velocity of Eg5 in single&#8208;molecule assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) exhibiting mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable properties were synthesized by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer networks. This research shines new light onto the development of dynamic covalent polymers for emerging applications in areas of bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optics and smart soft robotics.







Abstract
Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting a helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Mitochondrial Caseinolytic Protease P via a Site&#8208;Specific Photocrosslinking Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined approach of genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics allows identification of the substrate scope of mitochondrial human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP) in an unbiased manner in living mammalian cells. For this, the diazirine&#8208;bearing non&#8208;canonical amino acid DiazK is incorporated site&#8208;specifically at selected positions within the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP and trapped hClpP&#8208;substrates are enriched and identified via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. We combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site&#8208;specific incorporation of the diazirine&#8208;bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV&#8208;irradiation of cells, allows to covalently trap substrate proteins of hClpP and to substantiate hClpP's major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows identifying substrate dynamics upon application of external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP&#8208;substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.

         <title>Sustainable Superhydrophobic Surface with Tunable Nanoscale Hydrophilicity for Water Harvesting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity for enhancing highly efficient water capture and transport performance is developed. The hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface takes advantage of the surface&#8208;confined water of a cellulose nanocrystal under a humid environment and the hierarchical structure assembled by the wrinkled emulsion microparticles, to achieve an excellent water harvesting flux up to 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Superwettable surfaces show great potential in water harvesting applications, however, a scalable water harvesting surface remains elusive due to the trade&#8208;off between water deposition and transport. Herein, we report a unique superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity constructed by structured Pickering emulsions. Preferential exposure of the cellulose nanocrystal's outer surface and wax microspheres accelerates droplet deposition allowing for the manipulation of droplet mobility. Appropriate tuning of the wetting characteristics of the surfaces, optimizing the hydrophobicity and density of the water affinity nanodomains enhance the water deposition rate without the sacrifice of water transport rate, achieving an optimal water harvesting flux of 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a plate and 5.02&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a mesh. This hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface allows the controllable manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal to enhance the water harvesting efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen&#8208;bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation&#8208; and conformation&#8208;sensitive exciton coupling strength.







Abstract
Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures.

     alt="Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen-bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation- and conformation-sensitive exciton coupling strength.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligonucleotides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromophore organization via electrostatic, dipolar, &#960;&#8211;&#960;-stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The realized supramolecular motifs include hydrogen-bonded BAM&#8211;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of N&#8208;protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation&#8208;induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.







Abstract
Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (R,R), (S,S), (R,S), or (S,R). The (R,R)/(S,S) and (R,S)/(S,R) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as N&#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.

         <title>Selective Fluoromethyl Couplings of Alkynes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and BrCF2H or ICH2F in the presence of zinc is described. This process is based on a nickel&#8208;mediated radical addition/fluoromethyl coupling domino strategy and provides selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H&#8208; and CH2F&#8208;substituted alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF2H and ICH2F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.

         <title>Discovery of an Ultra&#8208;rapid and Sensitive Lysosomal Fluorescence Lipophagy Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of brand&#8208;new large Stokes shift and highly stable fluorescent dyes were constructed. In particular, the Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh fluorescent dye as a near&#8208;infrared emission lysosomal&#8208;specific probe with ultra&#8208;low concentration and ultra&#8208;fast staining characteristics for the complete lipophagy process imaging is presented.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases. However, many fluorescent dyes developed so far to target lysosomes cannot be used to monitor these processes due to the high concentrations required for imaging, long cell penetration times, and non&#8208;ideal photostability. In this regard, we synthesized three lysosomal targeting probes with large Stokes shifts, good stability, and high brightness. The Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh dye, developed by us for the first time, can stain lysosomes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.0&#8197;nM) without affecting the physiological functions of the lysosomes. More importantly, its excellent anti&#8208;interference ability and ultrafast lysosomal staining ability (within 1.0&#8197;min) clearly monitored the entire dynamic process of lipophagy. Ultimately, this method can greatly contribute to the study of autophagy pathways. This novel fluorescence platform shows great promise for the development of biological probes for application in pathological environments.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In&#8197;Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent hydrogen probe was developed for the first time by a catalytic hydrogenation strategy, enabling efficient detection of hydrogen molecules in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro with high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, in favor of uncovering and understanding underlying biological behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules.







Abstract
To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. A catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed the super&#8208;high transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cells, animals and plants, and discovered in&#8197;vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd3Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits excellent performance in CO2 hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo&#8208;generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO2 adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO2 accepts spillover H* from Pd3Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd3Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined Pd3Cu greatly promotes activity.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input. Herein, tiny Pd3Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66, to afford Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C and 1.25&#8197;MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo&#8208;generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO2* promotes CO2 activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd3Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF&#8208;supported Pd3Cu (Pd3Cu/UiO&#8208;66), the Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO2 and H2 activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion. This work provides a new avenue to the integration of solar and thermal energy for efficient CO2 hydrogenation under moderate conditions.

     alt="Light-Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO-66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu@UiO-66 exhibits excellent performance in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo-generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accepts spillover H* from Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO-66-confined Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu greatly promotes activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input. Herein, tiny Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO-66, to afford Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu@UiO-66 for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#8201;&#176;C and 1.25&#8197;MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo-generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* promotes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF-supported Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu (Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu/UiO-66), the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu@UiO-66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zinc Electrodeposition Enabled by a Self&#8208;Healable and Desolvation Shield for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healable and desolvation shield is designed as an artificial coating for aqueous Zn electrodes. This interface regulates the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn2+, restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion, and in&#8208;situ repairs the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. By means of the coating, a long&#8208;term cycling stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h is achieved.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces can alleviate the side reactions and the formation of the metallic (e.g., Li, Na, and Zn) dendrites. However, the traditional ones always breakdown during the repeated plating/stripping and fail to regulate the electrodeposition behaviors of the electrodes. Herein, a self&#8208;healable ion regulator (SIR) is designed as a desolvation shield to protect the Zn electrodes and guide the Zn electrodeposition. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, SIR shows a superb capability to in situ repair the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. Besides, the results of theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations show that the coating reduces water molecules in the solvated sheath of hydrated Zn2+ and restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion on the Zn surface. Even with a coating layer of only 360&#8197;nm, the SIR&#8208;modified Zn electrode exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &gt;950&#8197;h at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptor with Ultralow Nonradiative Voltage Loss for High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with an over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 is designed and synthesized. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based binary cell exhibits the lowest nonradiative voltage loss of 0.15&#8197;eV ever achieved by organic solar cells (OSCs). Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based semitransparent (ST)&#8208;OSCs, for the first time, achieve a power conversion efficiency of 14&#8201;% with an average visible transmittance over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) are considered as one of the most valuable applications of OSCs and a strong contender in the market. However, the optical band gap of current high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs is still not low enough to achieve the optimal balance between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 was designed and synthesized, based on which the device with PM6 as donor obtained a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%, accompanied with a nonradiative voltage loss as low as 0.15&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, ternary devices with the addition of SN into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 can achieve a PCE of 17.5&#8201;% with an unchanged open&#8208;circuit voltage and improved short&#8208;circuit current. Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, ST&#8208;OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 were fabricated and the optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 14.0&#8201;% at an AVT of 20.2&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE at an AVT over 20&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured cylindrical polymeric nanoparticles (tubisomes) are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic cyclic peptide polymer conjugate. Intriguingly, encapsulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release.







Abstract
Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it's still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks via traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which a cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent properties. Intriguingly, by encapsulating with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), both the fluorescence of tubisome and DOX can be quenched due to the energy transfer relay (ETR) effect. The release of DOX can induce the interruption of the ETR effect and recover the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ imaging of drug release. The AIE&#8208;featured supramolecular tubisomes reported here provide an alternative approach for fabricating cylindrical polymeric nanostructures and holds great potential for imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.

         <title>Symmetrically Tetra&#8208;functionalized Pillar[6]arenes Prepared by Fragment Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for synthesizing partially functionalized pillar[6]arenes is reported. It emphasizes the advantages of fragment coupling over one&#8208;pot synthesis in terms of preparing highly modifiable macrocycles for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, one of the synthesized pillar[6]arenes, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits cyan luminescence due to the through&#8208;space conjugation, which opens up new possibilities for designing luminescent macrocycles.







Abstract
Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one&#8208;pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this situation, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two&#8208;step fragment coupling method has been developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra&#8208;functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X&#8208;pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero&#8208;fragment coupling and pre&#8208;functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene&#8208;based cage have been prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365&#8197;nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non&#8208;covalent intra/intermolecular interactions helps rigidify the structure and make COOEtEtXP[6] an efficient solid&#8208;state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi&#8208;functionalization of other macrocycles.

It emphasizes the advantages of fragment coupling over one-pot synthesis in terms of preparing highly modifiable macrocycles for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, one of the synthesized pillar[6]arenes, &lt;b&gt;COOEtEtXP[6]&lt;/b&gt;, exhibits cyan luminescence due to the through-space conjugation, which opens up new possibilities for designing luminescent macrocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one-pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this situation, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two-step fragment coupling method has been developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra-functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X-pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero-fragment coupling and pre-functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene-based cage have been prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles, &lt;b&gt;COOEtEtXP[6]&lt;/b&gt;, exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365&#8197;nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through-space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non-covalent intra/intermolecular interactions helps rigidify the structure and make &lt;b&gt;COOEtEtXP[6]&lt;/b&gt; an efficient solid-state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi-functionalization of other macrocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen&#8208;centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as an authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8722;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly bonded to PdII. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8722;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N3SiMe3. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8722;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8722;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid colorimetric detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease using a zwitterionic peptide and gold colloids is reported. The sensor showed good performance in exhaled breath condensate with a limit of detection in the low nanomolar range. This technology can be integrated into regular face coverings for COVID&#8208;detection.







Abstract
The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases a positively charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t&lt;10&#8197;min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10&#8197;nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages bearing shape&#8208;shifting bullvalene ligands are prepared. The enormous potential complexity is limited by geometric constraints in solution, which converge to a single isomer in the solid state. Through detailed experimental and computational analysis, we map the fluxional nature of these systems.







Abstract
A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M=Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.

A series of new dinuclear PtII blue emitters bridged by phenylalkoxy&#8208;tethered pyrazole are reported with emission quantum yields up to 95&#8201;%, emission lifetimes down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient hyper&#8208;OLEDs fabricated exhibit a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;%, a FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and a device lifetime &gt;250&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new class of dinuclear PtII complexes with blue phosphorescence. Bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and tethered bridging ligands were employed to suppress photo&#8208;induced structural changes and to improve thermal stability of the complexes. These complexes show mixed 3IL/3MLCT blue emission (&#8776;460&#8197;nm) with emission quantum yields of up to 0.95, emission lifetimes of as low as 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants of up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped PMMA films; the latter is attributed to a 1MLCT excited state having high metal character (resulting in a large SOC) and a large transition dipole moment, based on DFT calculations. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized blue hyper&#8208;OLEDs with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.13, 0.12) showed a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;% with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 18&#8197;nm and a LT50 &gt;250&#8197;h at an L0 of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.







Abstract
We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low Tg vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.

         <title>Isolation and Properties of the Long Elusive Deep Blue Soluble [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep blue radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]., containing S(NtBu)3&#8208;caps isosteric to SO32&#8722;, forms in the solid state an equilateral K3 triangle caped by two S(NtBu)3 anions. The EPR spectrum, recorded in solution at room temperature, shows 13 main lines (a=2.6&#8197;G), each split into seven lines (a&#8776;0.38&#8197;G), through the coupling of the unpaired electron with the six 14N nuclei (I=1) and the three central 39K/41K nuclei (I=3/2).







Abstract
The reaction of potassium metal with sulfurtriimide S(NtBu)3 (II) gives the long elusive deep blue cage radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. (1_K) that crystallizes at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C from toluene solution. The subsequent physical characterization via X&#8208;ray structure analysis, UV/Vis&#8208;, and EPR spectroscopy from solution reveals the existence of one unpaired electron delocalized within the whole cage, i.e. coupling with the six nitrogen atoms, as well as the three potassium atoms caped by the two SN3 ligands. The present X&#8208;ray structure analysis further supports previous assumptions made on the parent compound 1_Li obtained from [Li4{(NtBu)3S}2] (I) and finally elucidates the structural arrangement of the SN3 caps and alkali metals in such radical cage species.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Hexahydridosilicate [SiH6]2&#8722; Coordinated by a Macrocycle&#8208;Supported Strontium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear strontium hexahydridosilicate complex has been isolated. It can be regarded as the adduct of two cationic strontium hydride fragments [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+ with SiH4.







Abstract
The cationic benzyl complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(CH2Ph)][A] (Me4TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyltetraazacyclododecane; A=B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2)4) reacted with two equivalents of phenylsilane to give the bridging hexahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)2Sr2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;&#954;3&#8201;:&#8201;&#954;3&#8208;SiH6)][A]2 (3&#8201;a). Rapid phenyl exchange between phenylsilane molecules is assumed to generate monosilane SiH4 that is trapped by two strontium hydride cations [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+. Complex 3&#8201;a decomposed in THF at room temperature to give the terminal silanide complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(SiH3)(thf)2][A], with release of H2. Upon reaction with a weak Br&#248;nsted acid, CO2, and 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene SiH4 was released. The reaction of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixture of cationic benzyl and neutral dibenzyl complex with phenylsilane gave the trinuclear silanide complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH3)2][A], while nOctSiH3 led to the trinuclear (n&#8208;octyl)pentahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH5nOct)][A].

         <title>Organic Supramolecular Zippers with Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence by a Dexter Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic supramolecular zipper system showing fascinating ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has been constructed. More importantly, detailed experimental and computational analysis suggest a new UOP mechanism involving Dexter energy transfer in single&#8208;component materials.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials glow persistently in the dark, which offers new exciting possibilities in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photoelectric devices and biological imaging. However, the development of single&#8208;component UOP materials remains a great challenge. Herein, we develop a single component organic supramolecular zipper system with a lifetime up to 0.77&#8197;s. Owing to the introduction of a pyrazole ring into the diphenylsulfone group, the &#8220;V&#8221; shaped molecules were artfully self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular zippers via &#960;&#8211;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, that is not only of significance in highly efficient generation of triplet excitons but also facilitates a Dexter energy transfer process within supramolecular zippers, that are responsible for alleviating radiative and non&#8208;radiative deactivation decay of triplet excitons, to finally boost the UOP. This finding not only gives a new set of guidelines for the design of single&#8208;component UOP molecules but also reveals the UOP mechanism from a new perspective.

         <title>Quantification of the Dynamic Interface Evolution in High&#8208;Efficiency Working Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental interplay among Li dynamic loss behavior, electrolyte composition, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was quantitatively elucidated. The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ as the anode interface undergoes processive evolution during cycling. The mechanistic studies shed fresh light on the interfacial dynamics of the Li&#8208;metal anode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has been considered a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the low reversibility and intricate Li loss hinder the widespread implementation of Li metal batteries. Herein, we quantitatively differentiate the dynamic evolution of inactive Li, and decipher the fundamental interplay among dynamic Li loss, electrolyte chemistry, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is practically determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ because of the persistent evolution of the Li metal interface during cycling. Distinct inactive Li evolution scenarios are disclosed by ingeniously tuning the inorganic anion&#8208;derived SEI chemistry with a low amount of film&#8208;forming additive. An optimal polymeric film enabler of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is demonstrated to derive a highly uniform multilayer SEI and decreased SEI Li+/dead Li0 growth rates, thus achieving enhanced Li cycling reversibility.

         <title>Unraveling the Function of Metal&#8211;Amorphous Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphization of the support for single&#8208;atoms catalysts (SACs) is another efficient but unknown strategy in improving the catalytic properties through adjusting the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). This work showcases a model ruthenium SAC and expounds on how the flexibly amorphous configuration of the support matrix functions unexpectedly in intensifying the MSI and further accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics of SACs.







Abstract
Amorphization of the support in single&#8208;atom catalysts is a less researched concept for promoting catalytic kinetics through modulating the metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). We modeled single&#8208;atom ruthenium (RuSAs) supported on amorphous cobalt/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi) to explore the favorable MSI between RuSAs and the amorphous skeleton for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Differing from the usual crystal counterpart (Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi), the electrons on RuSAs are facilitated to exchange among local configurations (Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Co/Ni) of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi since the flexibly amorphous configuration induces the possible d&#8211;d electron transfer and medium&#8208;to&#8208;long range p&#8211;&#960; orbital coupling, further intensifying the MSI. This embodies Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi with enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity, and rapid hydrogen migration, which results in superior durability and HER activity of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi, wherein only 15&#8197;mV can deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than the 58&#8197;mV required by Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isorosthin&#8197;L and Isoadenolin&#8197;I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise total syntheses of isorosthin&#8197;L and isoadenolin&#8197;I are described. This work highlights a convergent building&#8208;block&#8208;welding strategy for quick construction of an advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary center present in ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids from two readily available building blocks.







Abstract
Total syntheses of two Isodon diterpenes, isorosthin&#8197;L and isoadenolin&#8197;I, are reported. The synthetic strategy features a quick assembly of two simple building blocks through a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and a subsequent radical cyclization for efficient construction of a rather complex advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary stereocenter present in all Isodon diterpenes. Oxidative cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentane enabled the conversion to a lactone moiety which is desired for the construction of the molecular skeleton through reductive coupling with an aldehyde carbonyl group.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Conversion of Epoxides into Thiiranes: Mechanism, Stereochemical Model, and New Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations have clarified the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed thionation of epoxides with thiolactam by kinetic resolution. Bulky ortho groups are important to restrict the position of the epoxide group in the key transition states of the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, while increasing the size of the para&#8208;substituents also increases the enantioselectivity signifcantly.







Abstract
Computations and experiments leading to new chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) for epoxide thionations are reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of such CPA&#8208;catalyzed epoxide thionations. The calculated mechanistic information was used to design new efficient CPAs that were tested experimentally and found to be highly effective. Bulky ortho&#8208;substituents on the 3,3&#8242;&#8208;aryl groups of the CPA are important to restrict the position of the epoxide in the key transition states for the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Larger para&#8208;substituents significantly improve the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Tandem Living Insertion and Controlled Radical Polymerization for Polyolefin&#8211;Polyvinyl Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem polymerization of living olefin polymerization and controlled radical polymerization afforded through the introduction of radical traps by photoinitiation of macrochelates (MILRad functionalization) gives access to macroinitators generating a range of di&#8208; and triblocks containing olefinic, acrylic, styrenic and vinylic block segments.







Abstract
Practical synthesis of polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers remains a challenge for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerizations. Common approaches functionalize polyolefins for post&#8208;radical polymerization via insertion methods, yet sacrifice the livingness of the olefin polymerization. This work identifies an orthogonal radical/spin coupling technique which affords tandem living insertion and controlled radical polymerization. The broad tolerance of this coupling technique has been demonstrated for diverse radical/spin traps such as 2,2,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;azahexane&#8208;3&#8208;nitroxide (TIPNO), 1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine) &#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoisobutyrate (TEMPO&#8208;Br), and N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN). Subsequent controlled radical polymerization is demonstrated with nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), yielding polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl di&#8208; and triblock copolymers (&#272;&lt;1.3) with acrylic, vinylic and styrenic segments. These findings highlight radical trapping as an approach to expand the scope of polyolefin&#8208;functionalization techniques to access polyolefin macroinitiators.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescent Probe Allows Simultaneous Imaging of Main and Papain&#8208;like Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Infected Cells for Accurate Detection and Rapid Inhibitor Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
The simultaneous visualization of crucial proteases within SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected cells can be a significant benefit for the accurate detection of virus and rapid screening of inhibitors as well as for understanding the viral lifecycle. The catalytic efficiency, intracellular enzyme activity, and distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease and papain&#8208;like protease have now been exploited using peptide&#8208;based dual&#8208;color FRET probes and their inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) and papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) play critical roles in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication and are promising targets for antiviral inhibitors. The simultaneous visualization of Mpro and PLpro is extremely valuable for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and rapid inhibitor screening. However, such a crucial investigation has remained challenging because of the lack of suitable probes. We have now developed a dual&#8208;color probe (3MBP5) for the simultaneous detection of Mpro and PLpro by fluorescence (or F&#246;rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). This probe produces fluorescence from both the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores that are cleaved by Mpro and PLpro. 3MBP5&#8208;activatable specificity was demonstrated with recombinant proteins, inhibitors, plasmid&#8208;transfected HEK 293T cells, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected TMPRSS2&#8208;Vero cells. Results from the dual&#8208;color probe first verified the simultaneous detection and intracellular distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro and PLpro. This is a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of different proteases with value for the rapid screening of inhibitors.

A multi&#8208;amplification paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) platform has been designed for quantifying miRNA in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction and UV light have been employed to amplify the signal and ensure the sensitivity of the detection. More importantly, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interference signals from the blood. The platform showed high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability in a prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141.







Abstract
Accurate quantification of disease&#8208;signature microRNAs (miRNAs) in biomedical samples is in high demand for clinical diagnosis but still challenging because of the low abundance of miRNAs and complicating interferences in the milieus. Here, we report a multi&#8208;amplification strategy based on paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) for the analysis of miRNAs in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA&#8208;strand&#8208;displacement reaction (TSD) is employed to amplify the signal chain and to ensure the specificity. The signal chain is then cleaved by UV light to release signal molecules for detection. Moreover, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interfering substances in the blood and further enhance the sensitivity of detection. This concept is successfully demonstrated in the prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141 in blood and serum. The proposed TSD&#8208;PS MS approach provides an efficient method for the sensitive detection of oligonucleotides at low concentration in complicated milieus.

         <title>Mechanochemically Synthesised Flexible Electrodes Based on Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Glasses for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Co&#8211;Fe MOF glass was fabricated via post&#8208;synthetic adsorption of ferric coordination complex on ZIF&#8208;62(Co) followed by vitrification. The presence of bi&#8208;metal ions within the framework significantly improved the catalytic performance of the MOF glass. Then durable MOF glass electrodes were fabricated with ball milling for scalable electrocatalytic devices.







Abstract
The melting behaviour of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has aroused significant research interest in the areas of materials science, condensed matter physics and chemical engineering. This work first introduces a novel method to fabricate a bimetallic MOF glass, through melt&#8208;quenching of the cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [ZIF&#8208;62(Co)] with an adsorbed ferric coordination complex. The high&#8208;temperature chemically reactive ZIF&#8208;62(Co) liquid facilitates the formation of coordinative bonds between Fe and imidazolate ligands, incorporating Fe nodes into the framework after quenching. The resultant Co&#8211;Fe bimetallic MOF glass therefore shows a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance. The novel bimetallic MOF glass, when combined with the facile and scalable mechanochemical synthesis technique for both discrete powders and surface coatings on flexible substrates, enables significant opportunities for catalytic device assembly.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active functionalized polyacetylenes bearing a wide range of electronically distinct heteroatom&#8208;based groups have been prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROMP). Hallmarks of this work include enhanced polyacetylene solubility, air stability, and electrochromic switching in the near IR spectral window.







Abstract
The discovery of metallic conductivity in polyacetylene [&#8208;HC=CH&#8208;]n upon doping represents a landmark achievement. However, the insolubility of polyacetylene and a dearth of methods for its chemical modification have limited its widespread use. Here, we employ a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) protocol to prepare functionalized polyacetylenes (fPAs) bearing: (1)&#8197;electron&#8208;deficient boryl (&#8208;BR2) and phosphoryl (&#8208;P(O)R2) side chains; (2)&#8197;electron&#8208;donating amino (&#8208;NR2) groups, and (3)&#8197;ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium units via strain&#8208;promoted Click chemistry. These functional groups render most of the fPAs soluble and can lead to intense light absorption across the visible to near&#8208;IR region. Also, the presence of redox&#8208;active boryl and amino groups leads to opposing near&#8208;IR optical responses upon (electro)chemical reduction or oxidation. Some of the resulting fPAs show greatly enhanced air stability when compared to known polyacetylenes. Lastly, these fPAs can be cross&#8208;linked to yield network materials with the full retention of optical properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Polycarbonates by Organocatalytic Copolymerization of CO2 and Epoxides: From High Pressure and Temperature to Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB, as a superior organocatalyst toward copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides, has a metal&#8208;free nature, exhibits high efficiency and selectivity, can be used under ambient conditions, and synthesizes diverse CO2&#8208;PC products.







Abstract
Organophosphazenes combined with triethylborane (TEB) were selected as binary organocatalyts for the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides. Both the activity and selectivity were highly dependent on the nature of phosphazenes. 2,4,6&#8208;Tris[tri(1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)&#8208;iminophosphorane]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3) with a relatively low basicity (pKa=26.5 in CD3CN) and a bulky molecular size (&#966;=1.3&#8197;nm) exhibited an unprecedented efficiency (TON up to 12240) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity and &gt;99&#8201;% carbonate linkages) toward copolymerization of CO2 and cyclohexene oxide (CHO), and produced CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs) with high molar masses (Mn up to 275.5&#8197;kDa) at 1&#8197;MPa of CO2 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, this binary catalytic system achieved efficient CO2/CHO copolymerization with TOF up to 95&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;atm pressure and room temperature.

         <title>Thermal and Magnetic Field Switching in a Two&#8208;Step Hysteretic MnIII Spin Crossover Compound Coupled to Symmetry Breakings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new MnIII compound shows stepwise spin crossover (SCO) with two thermally hysteretic steps coupled to symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transitions. The superposition of two types of symmetry breakings leads to a rich interplay between structural and magnetic properties and stabilizes an unusual intermediate phase with four independent MnIII sites. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching at unprecedentedly low DC fields (onset &lt;5&#8197;T) is observed.







Abstract
A MnIII spin crossover complex with atypical two&#8208;step hysteretic thermal switching at 74&#8197;K and 84&#8197;K shows rich structural&#8211;magnetic interplay and magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching below 14&#8197;T with an onset below 5&#8197;T. The spin states, structures, and the nature of the phase transitions are elucidated via X&#8208;ray and magnetization measurements. An unusual intermediate phase containing four individual sites, where 
 are in a pure low spin state, is observed. The splitting of equivalent sites in the high temperature phase into four inequivalent sites is due to a structural reorganization involving a primary and a secondary symmetry&#8208;breaking order parameter that induces a crystal system change from orthorhombic&#8594;monoclinic and a cell doubling. Further cooling leads to a reconstructive phase transition and a monoclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with two inequivalent low&#8208;spin sites. The coupling between the order parameters is identified in the framework of Landau theory.

         <title>Be&#8211;Be &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Predicted Superconductivity in MBe2 (M=Zr, Hf)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beryllium in ZrBe2 and HfBe2 forms a honeycomb network of &#960; bonds. Both materials are valence isoelectronic and isostructural to MgB2, and like that compound, are predicted to be superconductors. Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, shows here that it may construct networks of low dimensionality by virtue of its ability to engage in &#960; bonding. Until now, this property was exclusively associated with elements from the p&#8208;block.







Abstract
Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, forms an aromatic network of delocalized Be&#8211;Be &#960; bonds in alloys ZrBe2 and HfBe2. This gives rise to stacked [Be2]4&#8722; layers with tetravalent cations in between. The [Be2]4&#8722; sublattice is isoelectronic and isostructural to graphite, as well as the [B]&#8722;2 sublattice in MgB2, and it bears identical manifestations of &#960; bonding in its electronic band structure. These come in the form of degeneracies at K and H in the Brillouin zone, separated in energy as the result of interlayer orbital interactions. Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4&#8197;K and 8.8&#8197;K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.

         <title>An Activatable Afterglow/MRI Bimodal Nanoprobe with Fast Response to H2S for In Vivo Imaging of Acute Hepatitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2S&#8208;activatable NIR afterglow/MRI bimodal nanoprobe F1&#8208;GdNP is designed, which shows fast reaction kinetics, high sensitivity and specificity toward H2S, offering a remarkable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow luminescence and strong &#8220;always on&#8221; MRI signal for reliable detection of hepatic H2S and H2S production&#8208;relevant enzyme (CSE) with high SBR and spatial&#8208;resolution.







Abstract
Accurate detection of hepatic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to monitor H2S&#8208;related enzymes&#8217; activity is critical for acute hepatitis diagnosis, but remains a challenge due to the dynamic and transient nature of H2S. Here, we report a H2S&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared afterglow/MRI bimodal probe F1&#8208;GdNP, which shows an &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; MRI signal and &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow signal toward H2S. F1&#8208;GdNP shows fast response, high sensitivity and specificity toward H2S, permitting afterglow imaging of H2S and evaluation of cystathionine &#947;&#8208;lyase (CSE)&#8217;s activity in living mice. We further employ the high spatial&#8208;resolution MRI signal of F1&#8208;GdNP to track its delivery and accumulation in liver. Importantly, F1&#8208;GdNP offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR=86.2&#177;12.0) to sensitively report on the increased hepatic H2S level in the acute hepatitis mice via afterglow imaging, which correlated well with the upregulated CSE activity in the liver, showcasing the good potential of F1&#8208;GdNP for monitoring of acute hepatitis process in vivo.

         <title>Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry For Modular Synthesis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report accelerated SuFEx click chemistry utilizing a synergistic BTMG&#8208;HMDS catalytic system. The power and versatility of the reaction are showcased by the SuFEx synthesis of &gt;100 unique molecules from diverse SuFExable hubs. Accelerated SuFEx is a next generation click reaction that improves upon existing protocols and expands the scope of accessible products.







Abstract
SuFEx click chemistry is a powerful method designed for the selective, rapid, and modular synthesis of functional molecules. Classical SuFEx reactions form stable S&#8722;O linkages upon exchange of S&#8722;F bonds with aryl silyl&#8208;ether substrates, and while near&#8208;perfect in their outcome, are sometimes disadvantaged by relatively high catalyst loadings and prolonged reaction times. We herein report the development of accelerated SuFEx click chemistry (ASCC), an improved SuFEx method for the efficient and catalytic coupling of aryl and alkyl alcohols with a range of SuFExable hubs. We demonstrate Barton's hindered guanidine base (2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine; BTMG) as a superb SuFEx catalyst that, when used in synergy with silicon additive hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), yields stable S&#8722;O bond linkages in a single step; often within minutes. The powerful combination of BTMG and HMDS reagents allows for catalyst loadings as low as 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% and, in congruence with click&#8208;principles, provides a scalable method that is safe, efficient, and practical for modular synthesis. ASSC expands the number of accessible SuFEx products and will find significant application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science.

&lt;p&gt;We report accelerated SuFEx click chemistry utilizing a synergistic BTMG-HMDS catalytic system. The power and versatility of the reaction are showcased by the SuFEx synthesis of &amp;gt;100 unique molecules from diverse SuFExable hubs. Accelerated SuFEx is a next generation click reaction that improves upon existing protocols and expands the scope of accessible products.

         <title>Modular Two&#8208;Step Access to &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthyridine Systems&#8212;Potent Building Blocks for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent modular two&#8208;step approach to naphthyridine&#8208;based polyaromatic compounds was achieved through gold catalysis followed by acid&#8208;mediated condensation and in situ desulfonation. Besides the halochromic behaviour of all synthesised &#960;&#8208;extended systems, one example shows outstanding sensitivity in detecting protons in non&#8208;protic solvents and allows a quantitative analysis in the low &#956;m area.







Abstract
Efficient synthetic approaches for the incorporation of nitrogen into polyaromatic compounds (PACs) in different patterns as stabilising moiety for &#960;&#8208;extended systems and modification tool for optoelectronic properties remain a challenge until today. Herein, we developed a new versatile pathway to napthyridine&#8208;based PACs as non&#8208;symmetric and regioisomeric pendant to pyrazine&#8208;based PACs. A combination of a gold&#8208;catalysed synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines and the development of an in situ desulfonation and condensation of these precursors are the key steps of the protocol. The shape and type of attached functional groups of the PACs can be designed in a late stage of the overall synthetic procedure by the chosen anthranile and backbone of the ynamide introduced in the gold&#8208;catalysed step. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the investigation of electronic properties of the compounds show the influence of the attached substituents. All naphthyridine&#8208;based PACs show halochromic behaviour implying their use as highly sensitive proton sensor in non&#8208;protic solvents.

         <title>High Water Adsorption MOFs with Optimized Pore&#8208;Nanospaces for Autonomous Indoor Humidity Control and Pollutants Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moderately hydrophilic MOF of UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH2&#8208;38&#8201;% with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability has been obtained by a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy, which shows ideal S&#8208;shaped water&#8208;sorption isotherm, high water&#8208;uptake working capacity and efficiency in the ASHRAE recommended humidity range, and prior capture ability of harmful organic and inorganic vapors, providing a promising candidate for autonomous indoor humidity control and air purification.







Abstract
The indoor air quality is of prime importance for human daily life and health, for which the adsorbents like zeolites and silica&#8208;gels are widely used for air dehumidification and harmful gases capture. Herein, we develop a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy to optimize the hydrophilicity, water&#8208;uptake capacity and air&#8208;purifying ability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long&#8208;term stability, offering an ideal candidate with autonomous multi&#8208;functionality of moisture control and pollutants sequestration. Through variant tuning of organic&#8208;linkers carrying hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the pore&#8208;nanospaces of prototypical UiO&#8208;67, a moderately hydrophilic MOF (UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH2&#8208;38&#8201;%) with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability is screened out, featuring S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherms exactly located in the recommended comfortable and healthy ranges of relative humidity for indoor ventilation (45&#8201;%&#8211;65&#8201;% RH) and adverse health effects minimization (40&#8211;60&#8201;% RH). Its exceptional attributes of water&#8208;uptake working capacity/efficiency, contaminants removal, recyclability and regeneration promise a great potential in confined indoor environment application.

         <title>Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimide&#8208;based COFs were synthesized via a geomimetic hydrothermal reaction, yielding materials having various pore dimensions and crystal structures. The solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the growth mechanism and reaction pathway, which determined the 3D stacking structures of the polyimide&#8208;based COFs.







Abstract
Despite its abundance, water is not widely used as a medium for organic reactions. However, under geothermal conditions, water exhibits unique physicochemical properties, such as viscosity and a dielectric constant, and the ionic product become similar to those of common organic solvents. We have synthesized highly crystalline polyimide&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PICs) under geomimetic hydrothermal conditions. By exploiting triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexacarboxylic acid in combination with various aromatic diamines, PICs with various pore dimensions and crystallinities were synthesized. XRD, FT&#8208;IR, and DFT calculations revealed that the solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the stacking structures of the crystalline PICs. Furthermore, the synthesized PICs demonstrate promising potential as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its unique redox&#8208;active properties and high surface area.

         <title>What Distinguishes the Strength and the Effect of a Lewis Acid: Analysis of the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
What is the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett number? An experimental and theoretical evaluation of factors that determine the 31P&#8197;NMR shifts of binding of 130 Lewis acids to triethylphosphine oxide allows linking the strength of a Lewis acid (global Lewis acidity) with the effect of a Lewis acid (effective Lewis acidity).







Abstract
IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation. This strength property was recently specified as global Lewis acidity (gLA), and is gauged for example by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the effect on a bound molecule, such as the induced 31P&#8197;NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Unfortunately, gLA and eLA often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the strength and the effect of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between gLA and eLA but its correction allows a unification for the first time.

         <title>Mapping the Regioisomeric Space and Visible Color Range of Purely Organic Dual Emitters with Ultralong Phosphorescence Components: From Violet to Red Towards Pure White Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative set of twelve highly luminescent dual emitters based on benzenesulfone moieties selectively attached to dibenzofuran is presented. These compounds can cover the whole visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and even behave as single&#8208;source white light emitters. They show ultralong phosphorescent afterglow at room temperature, based on the positioning of the sulfone moieties.







Abstract
We mapped the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum and achieved white light emission (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) by combining the intrinsic ns&#8208;fluorescence with ultralong ms&#8208;phosphorescence from purely organic dual emitters. We realized small molecular materials showing high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;L) in the solid state at room temperature, achieved by active exploration of the regioisomeric substitution space. Chromophore stacking&#8208;supported stabilization of triplet excitons with assistance from enhanced intersystem crossing channels in the crystalline state played the primary role for the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. This strategy covers the entire visible spectrum, based on organic phosphorescent emitters with versatile regioisomeric substitution patterns, and provides a single molecular source of white light with long lifetime (up to 163.5&#8197;ms) for the phosphorescent component, and high overall photoluminescence quantum yields (up to &#934;L=20&#8201;%).

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient strategy was developed for the environmentally benign conversion of furfural into polymer building blocks, maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, using photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation, hydrolysis and metathesis. The method offers high yielding steps with excellent selectivity while integrating multiple principles of green chemistry.







Abstract
Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of green chemistry in their chemical synthesis. We present a synthesis route starting from biomass&#8208;derived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85&#8201;% (2 steps) and 81&#8201;% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Triplet Generation Promoted via Spiro&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;unity triplet generation is achieved in SCTs solution with the help of spiro&#8208;charge transfer state, which facilitates the triplet generation and inhibits other excited state relaxation pathways.







Abstract
An intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant of 1.0&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 was previously registered with a spiro&#8208;bis&#8208;benzophenone scaffold. Triplet generation efficiency could be further enhanced by stabilizing the spiro&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and rationally designing spiro&#8208;compounds (SCTs) that consist of electron&#8208;rich diphenyl ether as the spiro&#8208;CT donor and electron&#8208;deficient dinaphthyl ketone as the spiro&#8208;CT acceptor. Through fine&#8208;tuning of the energy level between the CT and high energy triplet states, near&#8208;unity triplet generation quantum yield was achieved and the underlying ISC mechanism is revealed by using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Potential triplet sensitizing application was demonstrated in SCTs. Our findings suggest that a spiro&#8208;bichromophoric molecular system with an enhanced spiro&#8208;charge transfer warrants efficient triplet generation and is a powerful strategy of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet sensitizers with predictable ISC properties.

         <title>Cooperative Luminescence and Cooperative Sensitisation Upconversion of Lanthanide Complexes in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative luminescence and cooperative sensitization are observed for the first time in solution at the molecular scale with nona&#8208;nuclear clusters containing nine Yb atoms or a mixture of Yb and Tb ones. The cooperative sensitization upconversion processes in the mixed clusters were systematically investigated, showing the best performances for equimolar amounts of Yb and Tb in the clusters and using deuterated solvents and ligands.







Abstract
Upconversion materials have led to various breakthrough applications in solar energy conversion, imaging, and biomedicine. One key impediment is the facilitation of such processes at the molecular scale in solution where quenching effects are much more pronounced. In this work, molecular solution&#8208;state cooperative luminescence (CL) upconversion arising from a Yb excited state is explored and the mechanistic origin behind cooperative sensitisation (CS) upconversion in Yb/Tb systems is investigated. Counterintuitively, the best UC performances were obtained for Yb/Tb ratios close to parity, resulting in the brightest molecular upconversion complexes with a quantum yield of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;6 at a low laser power density of 2.86&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Condensed Supramolecular Helices: The Twisted Sisters of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bile salt biosurfactant with low molecular weight can self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular helices by interaction with oppositely charged polymers. A controlled condensation of the supramolecular helices into DNA&#8208;like hexagonally packed bundles and toroids can be achieved when using block copolymers of opposite charge and increasing the bile salt content.







Abstract
Condensation of DNA helices into hexagonally packed bundles and toroids represents an intriguing example of functional organization of biological macromolecules at the nanoscale. The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA&#8208;like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that the bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA&#8208;like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non&#8208;covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer&#8211;bile salt superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.

         <title>Enantioselective Allenation of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by Copper Halides of Mixed Oxidation States and Its Application to the Total Synthesis of Scorodonin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient CuCl/CuBr2 co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allenation of 2&#8208;alkynals involving the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective 1,5&#8208;H transfer of 1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amine intermediates has been developed. Various allenynes were obtained with excellent enantioselectivities. This reaction was applied to the first highly enantioselective total synthesis of natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;scorodonin and its enantiomer.







Abstract
Naturally occurring conjugated allenynes are of general interest owing to their potent and various biological activities. The 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines would be one of the most straightforward yet challenging approaches to such compounds since, in principle, two regioisomers may be formed involving two C&#8722;C triple bonds. Herein, a catalytic recipe of copper halides with mixed oxidation states, i.e., CuCl/CuBr2, has been identified to address the issues of the side reaction of conjugate addition and the selectivity of 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines in EATA (enantioselective allenation of terminal alkynes) reaction involving 2&#8208;alkynals. This method provided various allenynes with excellent enantioselectivities, and was also applied to the first highly enantioselective total synthesis of natural product scorodonin. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations elucidated the regioselectivity for the observed 1,5&#8208;H transfer.

         <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes by Cooperative Cu and Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual Cu/Ni catalytic system is identified for linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes with complementary regioselectivities to similar catalytic systems. Turnover numbers (TONs) with respect to Ni are as high as 72, and Cu is revealed to accelerate the rate of formation of the linear alkyl nickel intermediate. Examples for the diversification of pharmaceuticals are also demonstrated.







Abstract
Disclosed here is a dual copper and nickel catalytic system with a silyl hydride source for promoting the linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes. This carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming protocol is applied to couple a variety of functionalized vinylarenes with alkyl halides applying a nickel(II) NNN pincer complex in the presence of an NHC&#8208;ligated copper catalyst. This combination allows for a 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading of the nickel catalyst leading to turnover numbers of up to 72. Over 40 examples are presented, including applications for pharmaceutical diversification. Labeling experiments demonstrated the regioselectivity of the reaction and revealed that the copper catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate for formation of the reactive linear alkyl nickel complex. Overall, the presented work provides a complimentary approach for hydroalkylation reactions, whilst providing a preliminary mechanistic understanding of the cooperativity between the copper and nickel complexes.

         <title>19F NMR Allows the Investigation of the Fate of Platinum(IV) Prodrugs in Physiological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By 19F&#8208;labeling of a PtIV prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA=p&#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation in vitro, in living cells and in mice could be investigated by NMR spectroscopy while avoiding the interference of all background signals and allowing the simultaneous detection of pre&#8208; and post&#8208;activation species.







Abstract
PtIV prodrugs can overcome resistance and side effects of conventional PtII anticancer therapies. By 19F&#8208;labeling of a PtIV prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA=p&#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation under physiological conditions could be investigated. Unlike single&#8208;electron reductants, multi&#8208;electron agents can efficiently promote the two electrons reduction of PtIV to PtII. The activation of Pt&#8208;FBA in cell lysate is highly dependent upon the type of cancer cells. When administered to E. coli, Pt&#8208;FBA is reduced intracellularly and free FBA can shuttle out of the cell. The reduction rate greatly increases by inducing metallothionein overexpression and is lowered by addition of ZnII ions. When injected into mice, Pt&#8208;FBA undergoes fast reduction in the bloodstream accompanied by metabolic degradation of FBA; nevertheless, unreduced Pt&#8208;FBA can accumulate to detectable levels in liver and kidneys. The 19F&#8197;NMR approach has the advantage of avoiding the interference of all background signals.

         <title>Interface Chelation Induced by Pyridine&#8208;Based Polymer for Efficient and Durable Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The perovskite solar cell (PSC) has emerged rapidly in the field of flexible photovoltaics. A self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) polymer with pyridine&#8208;based heterocyclic structures and plenty of dynamic hydrogen bonds was utilized to passivate and heal the cracks at grain boundaries. A champion efficiency of 19.50&#8201;% was achieved and the PSC with SHP recovered 80&#8201;% of original efficiency after self&#8208;healing for 2&#8197;h in ambient atmosphere.







Abstract
Polymer doping is a significant approach to precisely control nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites and enhance electronic quality in perovskite solar cells (PSC) prepared in air. Here, a brand&#8208;new self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) with dynamic 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide (PDCA) coordination units and plenty of hydrogen bonds was designed and incorporated into perovskite films. PDCA units, showing strong intermolecular Pb2+&#8208;Namido, I&#8722;&#8208;Npyridyl, and Pb2+&#8208;Oamido coordination interactions, were expected to enhance crystallinity and passivate the grain boundary. In addition, abundant hydrogen bonds in SHP afforded the self&#8208;healing of cracks at grain boundaries for fatigue PSCs. Significantly, the doped device demonstrated a champion efficiency of 19.50&#8201;% with inconspicuous hysteresis, almost rivaling those achieved in control atmosphere. This strategy of heterocyclic&#8208;based macromolecular doping in PSCs will pave a way for realizing efficient and durable crystalline semiconductors.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One C2H2&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Guided Adsorptive Separation across an Isoreticular Family of Cationic Square&#8208;Lattice MOFs</title>

The first example of light hydrocarbon separation in a cationic MOF is demonstrated across a previously unreported pre&#8208;functionalized platform of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;efficient selective physisorption driven C2H2 separation from industrial C2&#8208;C1 impurities such as C2H4, CO2 and CH4 is of great importance in the purification of downstream commodity chemicals. We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, namely iMOF&#8208;nC (n=5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C2H2 uptakes versus the competing C2&#8208;C1 gases (C2H4, CO2 and CH4). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best&#8208;performing iMOF&#8208;6C revealed the first three&#8208;in&#8208;one C2H2 adsorption selectivity guided separation of C2H2 from 1:1 C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CH4 mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C2H2 selective interactions in iMOF&#8208;6C. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C2H2&#8208;selective layered metal&#8208;organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;Energy-efficient selective physisorption driven C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation from industrial C2-C1 impurities such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is of great importance in the purification of downstream commodity chemicals. We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal-organic frameworks, namely iMOF-nC (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes versus the competing C2-C1 gases (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best-performing iMOF-6C revealed the first three-in-one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption selectivity guided separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from 1:1 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selective interactions in iMOF-6C. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective layered metal-organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF Encapsulating N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Ligated Copper Single&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst towards Efficient Methane Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>

A catalyst with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;ligated Cu SAS as the active site, accompanied by many micro&#8208;nano reactors, synergistically promotes the electrochemical synthesis of methane.







Abstract
The exploitation of highly efficient carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst for methane (CH4) electrosynthesis has attracted great attention for the intermittent renewable electricity storage but remains challenging. Here, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;ligated copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal&#8211;organic framework is reported (2Bn&#8208;Cu@UiO&#8208;67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81&#8201;% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE with a current density of 420&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70&#8201;% within a wide potential range and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3&#8197;s&#8722;1. The &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates. The porosity of the catalyst facilitates the diffusion of CO2 to 2Bn&#8208;Cu, significantly increasing the availability of each catalytic center.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon&#8208;Based Nanoparticle&#8208;Supported Dispersed Cu2+ Disrupts Redox Homeostasis to Enhance CDT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized multifunctional carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;supported dispersed Cu2+ (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which significantly improves the efficacy of CDT. In vivo experiments revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs effectively inhibit tumor growth without side effects on the normal organs. Two&#8208;photon imaging in mice showed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), promising for brain tumor treatment.







Abstract
In chemodynamic therapy (CDT), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. However, the high levels of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells consume the ROS, directly reducing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which consume GSH via redox reactions to produce Cu+ that catalyze H2O2 to produce .OH, thus the ROS level was observably increased through this synergistic effect. In vivo experiments further revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can affect the activity of some protein sulfhydryl groups in cells, which was assessed by rdTOP&#8208;ABPP assay. In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a new approach to synthesizing molecules and materials based on the programmed de&#8208;reticulation and controlled etching at the molecular level in reticular materials, is introduced. Using this strategy, we have transformed two 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into two topologically distinct 3D MOFs, and one metal&#8208;organic polyhedra into a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle.







Abstract
Bond breaking is an essential process in chemical transformations and the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond breaking to reticular materials in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative, and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to the programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus to the design and synthesis of new molecules and materials.

         <title>Secondary Structure Tuning of a Pseudoprotein Between &#946;&#8208;Meander and &#945;&#8208;Helical Forms in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide functionalized with azide and alkyne, designed to undergo polymerization, crystallized in a geometry unsuitable for cycloaddition. However, it reacted at a high temperature, in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion, to yield a large polymer. The obtained polymer adopts a &#946;&#8208;meander&#8208;type secondary structure, which can be tuned to an &#945;&#8208;helix structure in solid&#8208;state by dissolution and solvent&#8208;evaporation.







Abstract
Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid&#8208;state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid&#8208;state. We designed the dipeptide monomer N3&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ala&#8208;NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8801;CH (1) for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide 1 adopts an anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H&#8208;bonded anti&#8208;parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;&#8208;meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;&#8208;meander to &#945;&#8208;helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation. This work demonstrates a novel paradigm for tuning the secondary structure of a polymer in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Inside Cover: Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 4/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimide&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized via a geomimetic hydrothermal reaction, yielding materials with various pore dimensions and crystal structures, as described in the Research Article (e202113780) by Byeong&#8208;Su Kim and co&#8208;workers. The solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the growth mechanism and reaction pathway, which determined the 3D stacking structures of the polyimide&#8208;based COFs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic binary phosphazene/triethylborane (TEB) system is highly active and selective towards the ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides to prepare diverse CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs). In their Research Article (e202111197), Shaofeng Liu, Zhibo Li, and co&#8208;workers report that this metal&#8208;free organocatalyst can efficiently copolymerize CO2 with cyclohexene oxide under ambient conditions (1&#8197;atm pressure and room temperature), which is an environmentally friendly and more carbon&#8208;balanced way toward CO2 utilization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clip&#8208;off chemistry represents a new synthetic methodology based on the rational cleavage of reticular materials. In their Research Article (e202111228), Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. report that in reticular materials, the cleavage of bonds can be quantitative and selective, effective both in solid&#8208;phase and solution&#8208;phase chemistry, and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. This chemistry is first used to synthesize two 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from precursor reticular materials.

The rapid synthesis of crystalline semiconducting covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) through a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ordered polymerization mechanism is described by Yuxi Xu and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202113926). Increasing the crystallinity of CTFs can significantly facilitate the photogenerated carrier transport and improve the photocatalytic activity. Single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be further obtained by ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk CTFs and exhibit superior photocatalytic performance.

DNA is a true polymer that has been regarded as the perfect building block for the construction of diverse materials. DNA gels possess many unique properties and are particularly suitable as generic materials. This Review discusses recent advances in the construction of DNA networks and highlights the applications of DNA as generic materials in various fields.







Abstract
DNA is a true polymer that stores the genetic information of an organism. With its amazing biological and polymeric characteristics, DNA has been regarded as a universal building block for the construction of diverse materials for real&#8208;world applications. Through various approaches including ligation, polymerization, chemical crosslinking, and physical crosslinking, both pure and hybrid DNA gels have been developed as generic materials. This Review discusses recent advances in the construction of DNA&#8208;based networks without considering any of DNA&#8242;s genetic properties. In addition, we highlight the biomedical and non&#8208;biomedical applications of DNA as generic materials. Owing to the superb molecular recognition, self&#8208;assembly, and responsiveness of DNA, a mushrooming number of DNA materials with various properties have been developed for general utilization.

         <title>Main Descriptors To Correlate Structures with the Performances of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity descriptors for electrocatalysis are summarized in this Minireview together with their merits/limitations to enable the rational construction of efficient catalysts. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover new and advanced descriptors is also described. Linear scaling relationships are also analyzed and several strategies proposed to overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Traditional trial and error approaches to search for hydrogen/oxygen redox catalysts with high activity and stability are typically tedious and inefficient. There is an urgent need to identify the most important parameters that determine the catalytic performance and so enable the development of design strategies for catalysts. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel structure&#8211;performance relationships. This Minireview summarizes reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d&#8208;band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discusses their merits/limitations. Understanding the trends in electrocatalytic performance and predicting promising catalytic materials using reactivity descriptors should enable the rational construction of catalysts. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have also been adopted to discover new and advanced descriptors. Finally, linear scaling relationships are analyzed and several strategies proposed to circumvent the established scaling relationships and overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.

         <title>Multiphase Microreactors Based on Liquid&#8211;Liquid and Gas&#8211;Liquid Dispersions Stabilized by Colloidal Catalytic Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid surface&#8208;active colloidal particles (emulsions, foams, bubbles, marbles, bijels) as microreactors. These new systems constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions, foams, bubbles, and marbles are dispersions of two immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a gas stabilized by surface&#8208;active colloidal particles. These systems can be used for engineering liquid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid microreactors for multiphase reactions. They constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability. This Review provides a systematic overview on the recent progress of liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid particles as microreactors for engineering eco&#8208;efficient reactions, with emphasis on biobased reagents. Physicochemical driving parameters, challenges, and strategies to (de)stabilize dispersions for product recovery/catalyst recycling are discussed. Advanced concepts such as cascade and continuous flow reactions, compartmentalization of incompatible reagents, and multiscale computational methods for accelerating particle discovery are also addressed.

         <title>Structural Elucidation of Cryptic Algaecides in Marine Algal&#8208;Bacterial Symbioses by NMR Spectroscopy and MicroED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging method MicroED was used in combination with NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the structures of eight novel and unusual alkaloids produced by the marine bacterial symbiont Phaeobacter inhibens when it is challenged with algal metabolites. Four of these molecules exhibited algaecidal activity, indicating that the bacteria can combine algal precursors to produce complex, hybrid natural products that kill the algal host.







Abstract
Microbial secondary metabolite discovery is often conducted in pure monocultures. In a natural setting, however, where metabolites are constantly exchanged, biosynthetic precursors are likely provided by symbionts or hosts. In the current work, we report eight novel and architecturally unusual secondary metabolites synthesized by the bacterial symbiont Phaeobacter inhibens from precursors that, in a native context, would be provided by their algal hosts. Three of these were produced at low titres and their structures were determined de novo using the emerging microcrystal electron diffraction method. Some of the new metabolites exhibited potent algaecidal activity suggesting that the bacterial symbiont can convert algal precursors, tryptophan and sinapic acid, into complex cytotoxins. Our results have important implications for the parasitic phase of algal&#8208;bacterial symbiotic interactions.

         <title>Reversible Photoswitching between Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence by Manipulating Excited State Dynamics in Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced reversible fluorescence (FL) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching in molecular aggregates was realized through repeatedly erasing and restoring the long&#8208;lived RTP under alternate ultraviolet and visible light exposure. The triplet excitons can be quenched via a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process.







Abstract
Regulation of fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8211;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o&#8208;BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o&#8208;BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long&#8208;lived RTP of o&#8208;BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In&#8208;depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo&#8208;controlled triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light&#8208;activated o&#8208;BFT to photoisomer c&#8208;BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence&#8208;RTP switching.

Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence-RTP switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitridic Analogs of Micas AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridic analogs of micas, AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr), have been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. These compounds expand the structural diversity of nitrides to mineral analogous structures, accommodating the high&#8208;pressure motif of sixfold coordinated Si. The luminescence properties of Eu2+&#8208;doped samples were investigated and narrow&#8208;band emission was revealed with emission maxima ranging from 451&#8197;nm to 492&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We present the first nitridic analogs of micas, namely AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr), which were synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa from the refractory nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4, the respective alkaline earth amides, implementing NH4F as a mineralizer. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping with atomic resolution, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and solid&#8208;state NMR. The structures consist of typical tetrahedra&#8211;octahedra&#8211;tetrahedra (T&#8208;O&#8208;T) layers with P occupying T and Si occupying O layers, realizing the rare motif of sixfold coordinated silicon atoms in nitrides. The presence of H, as an imide group forming the SiN4(NH)2 octahedra, is confirmed by SCXRD, MAS&#8208;NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from deep blue to cyan (451&#8211;492&#8197;nm).

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Bicycles: In Situ Access to Stable Constrained Peptides with Superior Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8211;bismuth bicycles are a new class of constrained peptides. Bismuth(III) is a selective and green reagent for the generation of stable and rigid bicycles from peptides with three cysteine residues. This biocompatible strategy allows in situ access to constrained peptides directly during screening campaigns and produces inhibitors of superior activity and proteolytic stability.







Abstract
Constrained peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We report here a fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and a non&#8208;toxic trivalent bismuth(III) salt. Peptide&#8211;bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the in situ generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 and 150&#8197;nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130&#8197;times more active and 19&#8197;times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borosulfate consisting of condensed tetrahedral [BO4] and [SO4] units always possesses small birefringence and unsatisfied phase&#8208;matching property. For the first time, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar [BO3] group has been introduced into borosulfate, leading to an evidently enhanced birefringence and a short&#8208;wavelength phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation in ABSO.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252&#8197;nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184&#8197;nm), large SHG response (1.1&#215;KDP at 1064&#8197;nm and 0.15&#215;&#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#8197;nm) and large birefringence (0.053 at 1064&#8197;nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.

         <title>A Multivariate&#8208;Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging of Pro&#8208;metastatic Targets in Extracellular Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multivariate&#8208;gated DNA nanodevice was engineered for spatially selective, correlated imaging of ATP and MMP2/9 in extracellular tumor microenviroment. The simultaneous visualization of the dual pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers may allow to discriminate tumors with high risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Probing pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers is of significant importance to evaluate the risk of tumor metastasis, but spatially selective imaging of such targets in extracellular microenvironment is particularly challenging. By introducing the bilinguality of PNA/peptide hybrid that can speak both peptide substrate and nucleobase&#8208;pairing languages to combine with aptamer technology, we designed a smart DNA nanodevice programmed to respond sequentially to dual pro&#8208;metastatic targets, MMP2/9 and ATP, in extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP&#8208;responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9&#8208;hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane&#8208;anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.

         <title>Optimizing Hydrogen Binding on Ru Sites with RuCo Alloy Nanosheets for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing Ru&#8722;H adsorption/desorption efficiency, via adjusting the Ru 
 orbital in RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets, enables highly promoted alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. This optimized adsorption/desorption efficiency is demonstrated by the hydrogen sensor and temperature programmed desorption experiments. The RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets possess a record low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C.







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, with considerable performance and desirable cost, are becoming highly interesting candidates to replace platinum (Pt) in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrogen binding at Ru sites (Ru&#8722;H) is an important factor limiting the HER activity. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the essence of Ru&#8722;H binding energy is the strong interaction between the 
 orbital of Ru and the 1s orbital of H. The charge transfer between Ru sites and substrates (Co and Ni) causes the appropriate downward shift of the 
&#8208;band center of Ru, which results in a Gibbs free energy of 0.022&#8197;eV for H* in the RuCo system, much lower than the 0.133&#8197;eV in the pure Ru system. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed using RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets (RuCo ANSs). They were prepared via a fast co&#8208;precipitation method followed with a mild electrochemical reduction. Structure characterizations reveal that the Ru atoms are embedded into the Co substrate as isolated active sites with a planar symmetric and Z&#8208;direction asymmetric coordination structure, obtaining an optimal 
 modulated electronic structure. Hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption (TPD) tests demonstrate the enhanced Ru&#8722;H interactions in RuCo ANSs compared to those in pure Ru nanoparticles. As a result, the RuCo ANSs reach an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 20.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. This holistic work provides a new insight to promote alkaline HER by optimizing the metal&#8208;H binding energy of active sites.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atom Incorporated in Ruthenium Oxide Sphere: A Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for HER and OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single atom is incorporated in a RuO2 sphere through a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process, as revealed by EXAFS, HRTEM, and AC&#8208;STEM. The Co single atoms could tailor the local electronic structure of the bifunctional electrocatalyst for high&#8208;performance HER and OER, which significantly reduces the energy barrier, and the catalyst shows the lowest overpotential of 45&#8197;mV for HER and 200&#8197;mV for OER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The development of highly active and stable bifunctional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial goal for clean and renewable energy, which still remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising a Co single atom incorporated in an RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which the Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere was confirmed by XAS, AC&#8208;STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses a Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45&#8197;mV for HER and 200&#8197;mV for OER, to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of a cobalt single atom.

Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic o&#8208;amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, initiates a complexity building photoinduced cascade of an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] topology, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single photochemical step with up to 220&#8197;mcbit complexity increases.

         <title>Reductive Alkylation of Alkenyl Acetates with Alkyl Bromides by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction between alkenyl acetates and alkyl bromides was achieved by reductive nickel catalysis. This method offers very mild reaction conditions for facile and precise synthesis of structurally versatile aliphatic alkenes using readily available and stable alkenyl reagents. It allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks.







Abstract
Catalytic alkylation of stable alkenyl C&#8722;O electrophiles is synthetically appealing, but studies to date have typically focused on the reactions with alkyl Grignard reagents. We report herein a cross&#8208;electrophile reaction of alkenyl acetates with alkyl bromides. This work has enabled a new method for the synthesis of aliphatic alkenes from alkenyl acetates to be established that can be used to add more structural complexity and molecular diversity with enhanced functionality tolerance. The method allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the NiI species plays an essential role for the success of the coupling of these two reactivity&#8208;mismatched electrophiles.

Broad&#8208;spectrum binding: New bivalent supramolecular reversal agents are formed by target templated synthesis in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic Super&#8208;sCx calixarene hosts form strong complexes to a variety of structurally diverse target neuromuscular blocking agents.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of bivalent water&#8208;soluble calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene hosts, Super&#8208;sCx4 and Super&#8208;sCx5 as new broad&#8208;spectrum supramolecular binders of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Synthesis was achieved using the target bisquaternary amine NMBAs as a template to link two highly anionic p&#8208;sulfonatocalixarene building blocks in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic hosts Super&#8208;sCx4 and Super&#8208;sCx5 bind by engaging both quaternary amines present on a variety of NMBAs. We report low &#956;M binding to structurally diverse alkyl, steroidal, curarine and benzylisoquinoline NMBAs with high selectivity over the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a variety of other hydrophobic amines.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the synthesis of bivalent water-soluble calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene hosts, &lt;b&gt;Super-sCx4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Super-sCx5&lt;/b&gt; as new broad-spectrum supramolecular binders of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Synthesis was achieved using the target bisquaternary amine NMBAs as a template to link two highly anionic &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonatocalixarene building blocks in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic hosts &lt;b&gt;Super-sCx4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Super-sCx5&lt;/b&gt; bind by engaging both quaternary amines present on a variety of NMBAs. We report low &#956;M binding to structurally diverse alkyl, steroidal, curarine and benzylisoquinoline NMBAs with high selectivity over the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a variety of other hydrophobic amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination Reactions by a Formal C&#8722;C Coupling/Defluorination Reaction with Diazoacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amines unlock an unconventional reaction of diazoalkanes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. Under photocatalytic conditions, no cyclopropanation occurs, instead a gem&#8208;difluoroolefin is formed via C&#8722;C bond formation and fluoride elimination.







Abstract
The photolysis of diazoalkanes to conduct singlet carbene transfer reactions of colored diazoalkanes has recently attracted significant interest in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a photocatalytic approach that allows the access of triplet carbene intermediates via energy transfer to conduct highly efficient gem&#8208;difluoroolefination reactions with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. The use of a tertiary amines proved pivotal to unlock this unusual reaction pathway and to prevent undesired cyclopropanation pathways. The amine further facilitates the ultimate abstraction of fluoride to yield gem&#8208;difluoroolefins (43 examples, up to 88&#8201;% yield), which is supported by experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies. We explored this synthesis method with a broad substrate scope, ranging from simple olefins and heterocyclic olefins towards the decoration of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks.

         <title>Production of Copolyester Monomers from Plant&#8208;Based Acrylate and Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route is developed to prepare PCTA monomer with plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The features include catalytic MBH reaction, one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction over H2SO4/SiO2 catalyst, and Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. In addition, commonly used plasticizer di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) benzenedicarboxylate and monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol can also be manufactured.







Abstract
PCTA is an important copolyester that has been widely used in our daily necessities. Currently, its monomers are industrially produced from petroleum&#8208;derived xylene. To reduce the reliance on fossil energy, we herein disclose an alternative route to access PCTA monomer (terephthalate/isophthalate=2.4/1) in 61&#8201;% overall yield using plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The process includes Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of acetaldehyde with acrylate, subsequent one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with acrylate over H2SO4/SiO2 catalyst, and final Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. Besides, when varying the final step to hydrogenation, another important monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol (1,4&#8208;trans/1,4&#8208;cis/1,3&#8208;trans/1,3&#8208;cis=5.2/2/2.5/1) can be produced in 67&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Synthesis of a [2]Catenane CoII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand 1,2&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene, H2L, self assembles with CoII to form {[Co4(H2L)6]8+} rectangles which mechanically interlock via self&#8208;assembly to form a [2]catenane. The catenated structure displays single&#8208;molecule magnetism (SMM), highlighting how mechanically interlocked systems can be used to arrange SMM centers in topologically complex arrays.







Abstract
We describe herein the self&#8208;assembly synthesis of an octanuclear CoII [2]catenane {[Co4(H2L)6]216+} formed by the mechanical interlocking of two {[Co4(H2L)6]8+} rectangles of unprecedented topology. Subtle manipulation of the synthetic conditions allows the isolation of a mixed&#8208;valence [Co2III/Co2II]10+ non&#8208;catenated rectangle. The CoII centers in the [2]catenane exhibit slow relaxation of their magnetic moment, i.&#8201;e. single&#8208;molecule magnet properties, dominated by quantum tunneling and Raman relaxation processes. This work shows that metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry can precisely control the organization of single&#8208;molecule magnets in topologically complex arrangements.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8211;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a thermo&#8208;responsive jamming of SPNPs dense suspensions for obtaining macroscopic smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs.







Abstract
Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but were often limited to irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO2&#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to a temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at the solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact properties and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328&#8197;cm&#8201;s&#8722;1. We envision that this finding offers inspiration to design smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials for impact protection.

         <title>Controlling Syneresis of Hydrogels Using Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For self&#8208;shrinkable hydrogels, syneresis can be controlled by tuning the hydrophobic microenvironment within the gel network involving co&#8208;assembly with organic salts.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8211;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the co&#8208;assembled gel fibres thereby enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.

         <title>Bulky Cyclometalated Ruthenium Nitrates for Challenging Z&#8208;Selective Metathesis: Efficient One&#8208;Step Access to &#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;Olefins from Acrylates and Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent challenge in olefin metathesis is the lack of a widely applicable method that converts feedstock allyl alcohols and acrylates to valuable &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins. Here, enabled by bulky cyclometalated Ru&#8208;nitrate catalysts whose syntheses were newly unlocked, Z&#8208;selective metathesis between terminal olefins could now be used to access Z&#8208;allyl alcohols, Z&#8208;alkenyl esters, and Z&#8208;alkenyl acids in high yields and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules and serve as versatile handles for organic synthesis, but their syntheses are often tedious and less selective. Here we report the efficient Z&#8208;selective metathesis of various terminal acrylates and allyl alcohols, which enables facile and selective construction of high value&#8208;added &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins from readily available feedstock chemicals. These challenging metathesis transformations are enabled by novel cyclometalated Ru&#8208;carbene&#8208;nitrate complexes bearing bulky&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible side arms, whose assembly was unlocked by new organometallic syntheses.

         <title>Diazapentabenzocorannulenium: A Hydrophilic/Biophilic Cationic Buckybowl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exceeds one: Diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic corannulene derivative bearing an internal imidazolium core, was prepared by a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy. The introduction of positive charge and two nitrogen atoms into corannulene resulted in remarkable molecular properties, such as the formation of charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns, high dispersibility in water, and selective introduction into the mitochondria of tumor cells.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic molecules are promising functional materials for a wide range of applications, especially in organic electronics. However, their largely hydrophobic nature has impeded further applications. As such, imparting high solubility/hydrophilicity to polycyclic aromatic molecules leads to a breakthrough in this research field. Herein, we report the synthesis of diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded buckybowl bearing a central imidazolium core, by a bottom&#8208;up strategy from polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide. X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses have revealed a bowl&#8208;shaped molecular structure that is capable of forming charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns by bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl packing. In addition to its fluorescence capabilities and high dispersibility in water, the molecule was found to selectively localize in the mitochondria of various tumor cells, showing potential as viable mitochondria&#8208;selective fluorescent probes.

         <title>The Chiral Target of Daptomycin Is the 2R,2&#8242;S Stereoisomer of Phosphatidylglycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daptomycin (dap), an important clinical antibiotic, recognizes the absolute configuration of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a key lipid found in bacterial membranes. The configuration at the headgroup of PG was found to be particularly important for dap&#8211;PG interactions. This is a rare example of a natural product targeting a membrane lipid through chiral recognition.







Abstract
Daptomycin (dap) is an important antibiotic that interacts with the bacterial membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a calcium&#8208;dependent manner. The enantiomer of dap (ent&#8208;dap) was synthesized and was found to be 85&#8208;fold less active than dap against B. subtilis, indicating that dap interacts with a chiral target as part of its mechanism of action. Using liposomes containing enantiopure PG, we demonstrate that the binding of dap to PG, the structural transition that occurs upon dap binding to PG, and the subsequent oligomerization of dap, depends upon the configuration of PG, and that dap prefers the 1,2&#8208;diacyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;sn&#8208;glycerol stereoisomer (2R,2&#8242;S configuration). Ent&#8208;dap has a lower affinity for 2R,2&#8242;S liposomes than dap and cannot oligomerize to the same extent as dap, which accounts for why ent&#8208;dap is less active than dap. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby the activity of an antibiotic depends upon the configuration of a lipid head group.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Enabled by Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Nitride Heterostructured Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon nanotube/carbon nitride heterostructured photocathode is designed to efficiently utilize photo&#8208;energy to boost sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution kinetics of the Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting Li&#8722;CO2 battery achieves a record&#8208;high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, superior cycling stability with high efficiency retention of 86.1&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh areal capacity of 15.77&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2 reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8722;CO2 battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting battery delivers a high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04&#8197;V) and superior cycling stability (86.1&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Copper Catalysis for the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state copper catalysis enables the synthesis of more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs.







Abstract
Heterocycles are one of the largest groups of organic moieties with significant medicinal, chemical, and industrial applications. Herein, we report the discovery and development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, synergistic excited&#8208;state copper catalysis using a combination of Cu(IPr)I as a catalyst and rac&#8208;BINAP as a ligand, which produces more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs. Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests in situ generations of [Cu(BINAP)2]+ and [Cu(IPr)2]+ catalysts that work cooperatively under visible&#8208;light irradiation to facilitate catalytic carbo&#8208;aroylation of unactivated alkenes, affording a wide range of useful heterocycles.

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 4, January 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted 2D ordered and rapid polymerization strategy is developed to prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs at the hundred&#8208;gram level within 20&#8197;minutes for the first time. Abundant single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit remarkable photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
The rapid synthesis of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and exploration of the polymerization mechanism are highly desired for the research of crystalline porous polymers, but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy to successfully prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs within 20 minutes for the first time. By in situ imaging and time&#8208;dependent characterization, we proposed an ordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization mechanism for crystalline CTFs, in which the monomers rapidly polymerize into periodic 2D molecular sheets within 10&#8197;s and then grow into more ordered framework structures. Photocatalytic study of CTF with different crystallinity revealed that large crystalline domain could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Single&#8208;layer and few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets could be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit nearly fivefold improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate up to 7971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Carbonyls and &#960;&#8208;Cation Effect for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COF) possess a robust and porous crystalline structure, making them an appealing candidate for energy storage. Herein, we report an exfoliated polyimide COF composite (P&#8208;COF@SWCNT) prepared by an  in&#8208;situ  condensation of anhydide and amine on the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes as advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Numerous active sites exposed on the exfoliated frameworks and the various open pathways promote the highly efficient ion diffusion in the P&#8208;COF@SWCNT while preventing irreversible dissolution in the electrolyte. During the charging/discharging process, K  +  is engaged in the carbonyls of imide group and naphthalene rings through the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K  +  effect, which is demonstrated by the DFT calculation and XPS, ex&#8208;situ FTIR, Raman. As a result, the prepared P&#8208;COF@SWCNT anode enables incredibly high reversible specific capacity of 438 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 0.05 A g  &#8208;1  and extended stability. The structural advantage of P&#8208;COF@SWCNT enables more insights into the design and versatility of COF as an electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60 min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;cationic Self&#8208;assembled Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A self&#8208;assembled Fe  II  4  L  6  cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a ~6 pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents. This strategy allows for the synthesis of enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Allenylation of Aldehydes with Propargyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Allenol is a versatile synthon in organic synthesis. The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenols from readily available starting materials remains a prominent challenge, especially when simultaneous control over axial and central chirality is required. Herein, we describe the Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides to rapidly access a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;allenols with adjacent axial and central chiralities. This method features excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity control with broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to all four stereoisomers when allied with Mitsunobu reaction. Preliminary mechanistic studies support radical&#8208;based reaction pathways. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;varitriol.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Colour on Demand: Control by Optical Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to modulate, tune, and control fluorescence colour has attracted much attention in photonics&#8208;related research fields. The most examined approach has been the design and synthesis of luminescent materials such as luminescent nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots). However, thus far, it has been impossible to achieve fluorescence colour control (FCC) for material with a fixed structure, size, surrounding medium, and concentration. Here, we propose a novel approach to FCC using optical tweezers. We demonstrate an optical trapping technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) that can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential of the laser tweezers. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased, evidenced by a fluorescence signal colour change from blue to orange. Using nanostructure assisted optical tweezing, we demonstrate control of the relative intensity ratio of fluorescence of the two fluorophores, thus showing remote and reversible FCC of the polymer assembly.</dc:description>

A novel flow electrochemical reactor that accomplishes electrolysis within a few seconds was developed, enabling flash generation of short&#8208;lived carbocations and trapping reaction with nucleophiles before they decompose. The present methodology was applied to highly reactive oxocarbenium ions, N&#8208;acyliminium ions, glycosyl cations, and the Ferrier cations. Moreover, continuous and flash synthesis of a pharmaceutical precursor using the flow reactor system was successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
A novel flow electrochemical reactor that accomplishes electrolysis within a few seconds in a single passage was developed. By using the flow reactor system, the flash electrochemical generation of short&#8208;lived carbocations, including oxocarbenium ions, N&#8208;acyliminium ions, glycosyl cations, and Ferrier cations was achieved within a few seconds, enabling the subsequent reaction with nucleophiles before their decomposition. Moreover, continuous operation based on the present system enabled the rapid synthesis of pharmaceutical precursors on demand.

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments &#8212;regioregular head to tail structure&#8212;, Raman and IR studies &#8212;E configuration of the polyene double bonds&#8212; and high&#8208;resolution AFM images &#8212;helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix&#8212;. As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical ECD studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow deciphering that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied with an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).</dc:description>

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(  N  &#8208;pyrrolidino)&#173;cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanism of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered  concerted  pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*  N=N  ) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for  stepwise  cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40 kJ mol  &#8211;1  lower in energy in CHCl  3  (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Organization of DNA Oligomers for Transient Catalytic Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems opens doors for man&#8208;made life&#8208;like materials. Yet, creating distinct transient functions from artificial fuel&#8208;driven structures remains a challenge. Building on our ATP&#8208;driven dynamic covalent DNA assembly in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction, we introduce ATP&#8208;fueled transient organization of functional subunits for various functions. The programmability of the ligation/restriction site allows to precisely organize multiple sticky&#8208;end&#8208;encoded oligo segments into double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA complexes. We demonstrate principles of ATP&#8208;driven organization into sequence&#8208;defined oligomers by sensing barcode&#8208;embedded targets with different defects. Furthermore, ATP&#8208;fueled DNAzymes for substrate cleavage are achieved by transiently ligating two DNAzyme subunits into a dsDNA complex, rendering ATP&#8208;fueled transient catalytic function.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two highly red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;  activation  = 410&#8208;490 nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;  activation  = 400&#8208;550 nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;  activation  = 520&#8208;550 nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Rechargeable Aluminium&#8208;Amine Battery Working Under Quaternization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminium (Al) batteries (RABs) have long been pursued due to the high sustainability and three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer properties of Al metal. However, limited redox&#8208;chemistry is available for rechargeable Al batteries, which restricts the exploration of cathode materials. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient Al&#8208;amine battery based on a quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R  3  N  &#8226;+  or R  4  N  +  ) are formed to store anionic Al complex. The reactive aromatic amine molecules further oligomerize during cycling, inhibiting amine dissolution into electrolyte. Consequently, the constructed Al&#8208;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135 mAh g  &#8208;1  along with a superior cycling life (4000 cycles), fast charge capability and a high energy efficiency of 94.2%. Moreover, the Al&#8208;amine battery shows excellent stability against self discharge, far beyond conventional Al&#8208;graphite battery. Our findings pave an avenue to advance the chemistry of RABs and thus battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Quinolizine AIE System: Visualization of Molecular Motion and Elaborate Tailoring for Biological Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motions are ubiquitous in nature and they immutably play intrinsic roles in all actions. However, exploring appropriate models to decipher molecular motions is an extremely important but very challenging task for researchers. Considering aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens possess their unique merits to visualize molecular motions, it is particularly fascinating to construct new AIE systems as model to study molecular motion. Herein, a novel quinolizine (QLZ) AIE system was constructed based on the restriction intramolecular vibration mechanism. It was demonstrated that QLZ could act as an ideal model to visualize single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion  via  fluorescence change. Additionally, further elaborate tailoring of this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production and realized fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications, which confirms the great application potential of this new AIE&#8208;active QLZ core. Therefore, this work not only provides an ideal model to visualize molecular motion but also opens a new way for the application of AIEgens.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Permanence in Diarylethene&#8208;Functionalized Liquid Crystal Elastomers Facilitated by Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene&#8208;functionalized liquid crystalline elastomers (DAE&#8208;LCEs) containing thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds were prepared and shown to undergo reversible, reprogrammable photoinduced actuation. Upon exposure to UV light, a monodomain DAE&#8208;LCE generated 5.5% strain. This photogenerated strain was demonstrated to be optically reversible over five cycles of alternating UV/visible light exposure with minimal photochrome fatigue. The incorporation of thiol&#8208;anhydride dynamic bonds allowed for retention of actuated states. Further, re&#8208;programming of the nematic director was achieved by heating above the temperature for bond exchange to occur (70&#176;C) yet below the nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature (100&#176;C) such that order was maintained between mesogens. The observed thermal stability of each of the diarylethene isomers of over 72 h allowed for decoupling of photo&#8208;induced processes and polymer network effects, showing that both polymer relaxation and back&#8208;isomerization of the diarylethene contributed to LCE relaxation over a period of 12 hours after actuation unless bond exchange occurred.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adjusting Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Capture of Trace Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capture of the xenon and krypton from nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas is essential to the treatment of radioactive waste. Although various porous materials have been employed to capture Xe and Kr, the development of high&#8208;performance adsorbents capable of trapping Xe/Kr at very low partial pressure as in the in the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8208;organic framework based on multiple weak binding interactions to capture trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior of ATC&#8208;Cu and its mechanism have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu unprecedented uptake capacities of 2.65 and 0.52 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  for Xe and Kr respectively at 0.1 bar and 298 K, as well as the record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. Our work not only provides a benchmark Xe adsorbent but proposes a new route to construct smart materials for efficient separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Halogenation, &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation, and Acylation by a Remarkably Versatile Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymatic assembly lines that synthesize many bioactive natural products of therapeutic relevance. While PKS catalysis is mostly based on fatty acid biosynthetic principles, polyketides can be further diversified by post&#8208;PKS enzymes. Here, we characterized a remarkably versatile trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS from Serratia that builds structurally complex macrolides via more than ten functionally distinct PKS modules. In the oocydin PKS, we identified a new oxygenation module that &#945;&#8208;hydroxylates polyketide intermediates, a halogenating module catalyzing backbone &#947;&#8208;chlorination, and modular O&#8208;acetylation by a thioesterase&#8208;like domain. These results from a single biosynthetic assembly line highlight the expansive biochemical repertoire of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and provide diverse modular tools for engineered biosynthesis from a close relative of E. coli.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional square planar platinum complexes typically form one&#8208;dimensional assemblies as a result of unidirectional metallophilic and/or &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions. Organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape are presented herein to construct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence. These 2D crystals show unique monocomponent  &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;  stacking from either the cyclometalating or noncyclometalating ligand and the bicomponent alternate &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking from both ligands along different facet directions. Anisotropic tri&#8208;directional waveguiding is further implemented on a single hexagonal microcrystal. These results demonstrate the great capability of organoplatinum(II) cruciform as a general platform to fabricate 2D phosphorescent micro&#8208;/nanocrystals for advanced photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru superstructure for enhancing hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superlattice has attracted extensive research attentions due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattice are mainly limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of superlattice on catalysis in metal&#8208;based nanostructures is largely unexplored yet. Herein, for the first time we report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with superlattice, and demonstrate the significant impact of superlattice on enhancing electrocatalysis. Detailed characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking the adjacent Ru layers with twisted angles from 2  o  to 30  o  . Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs with superlattice can serve as high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where the overpotential is 24 mV for reaching 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which is lower than those of Ru NSs (61 mV) and commercial Pt/C (70 mV). Theoretical calculations reveal that superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, leading to the lattice contraction and the weakening *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work not only fabricates the metal&#8208;based superlattice, but also sheds new light on the utilization of superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable thioketyl radical anion formed by reduction of a phosphanylthioketone with alkali metals is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the products were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radicals is mainly localized at the thiocarbonyl C&#8722;S unit.







Abstract
Alkali metal salts, M+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S].&#8722; (M=Na, K; 2_M; Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S (1), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within 2_M is mainly located at the sulfur (49&#8201;%) and the carbonyl carbon (33&#8201;%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand to the radical species 2_K to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(&#8722;S&#8208;iPr)&#8722;P(iPr)2S]&#8722; (3) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an iPr group from a second anion. The products were fully characterized and application of the radical anion as a reducing agent was demonstrated.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Additions of Enol Silanes to In Situ Generated Cyclic, Aliphatic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are essential pharmacophores in drugs and natural products, and general methods for their enantioselective synthesis are still highly sought after. A new direct approach utilizing hemiaminal methyl ethers as N&#8208;acyliminium precursors for the enantioselective preparation of cyclic, aliphatic and 2&#8208;subsituted pyrrolidines, piperidines and azepanes has been achieved.







Abstract
Strong and confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalysts enable highly enantioselective substitutions of cyclic, aliphatic hemiaminal ethers with enol silanes. 2&#8208;Substituted pyrrolidines, piperidines, and azepanes are obtained with high enantioselectivities, and the method displays a broad tolerance of various enol silane nucleophiles. Several natural products can be accessed using this methodology. Mechanistic studies support the intermediacy of non&#8208;stabilized, cyclic N&#8208;(exo&#8208;acyl)iminium ions, paired with the confined chiral counteranion. Computational studies suggest transition states that explain the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Crosslinked Polypeptide Films via RAFT&#8208;Mediated Continuous Assembly of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research into polypeptide films extends beyond polypeptide characterization into their fabrication. Herein, we report the novel fabrication of chemically crosslinked polypeptide films using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Secondary structure analysis reveals unusually high random coil formation and such films further demonstrate biodegradability useful for tissue engineering and drug delivery.







Abstract
Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil content through continuous assembly polymerization via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1&#177;1.1&#8197;nm thick which could be increased to 94.9&#177;8.2&#8197;nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8211;50&#8201;% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of dynamic nuclear polarization of guest molecules in a porous host material at around room temperature is reported. The induced fit of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) for guest molecules suppresses the nuclear spin relaxation and allows the polarization transfer to target guest molecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts, 1H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8211;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced 19F&#8197;NMR signal of guest target molecules.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry Enabled High&#8208;Performance Iodide&#8208;Ion Conversion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inter&#8208;halogen strategy for non&#8208;negative halogen fixation to fully activate and stabilize the unrealized I0/I+ redox via electrolyte modification, leading to two&#8208;electron redox chemistry has been demonstrated. An unprecedented high voltage plateau, capacity, and energy density were obtained with our strategy, which may also particularly advance iodine redox chemistry.







Abstract
A single&#8208;electron transfer mode coupled with the shuttle behavior of organic iodine batteries results in insufficient capacity, a low redox potential, and poor cycle durability. Sluggish kinetics are well known in conventional lithium&#8211;iodine (Li&#8722;I) batteries, inferior to other conversion congeners. Herein, we demonstrate new two&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I&#8722;/I+ with inter&#8208;halogen cooperation based on a developed haloid cathode. The new iodide&#8208;ion conversion battery exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;art capacity of 408&#8197;mAh&#8201;gI&#8722;1 with fast redox kinetics and superior cycle stability. Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42&#8197;V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgI&#8722;1 is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature&#8208;insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8722;I+ species and their functions are clarified.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Prediction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a machine&#8208;learning tool that predicts the porosity of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials based solely on chemical properties of their constituents: the metal and the inorganic linker. Our method leverages data available for thousands of synthesised MOF in prediction of properties of interest in potential synthetic targets without requiring knowledge of their structure but only requiring the knowledge of their constituents.







Abstract
The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5&#8201;% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.

         <title>A Topologically Engineered Gold Island for Programmed In Vivo Stem Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated processing chain of therapeutic cells based on topologically engineered ligands, nuclease&#8208;mimic artificial enzyme and tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field is constructed. The integration of multiple functional components guides stem cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation detachment, in&#8197;situ magnetic labeling and retention at the implantation site, thus allowing programmed stem cell manipulation in vivo over prolonged time.







Abstract
Even a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in&#8197;situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics CeIV complexes and magnetic core Fe3O4, are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under a tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in&#8197;situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both in vitro and in vivo, offering fascinating opportunities for a biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been realized. This system integrates direct generation of difluoromethylated stereocenters and enantioselective carbon(sp3)&#8722;silicon bond formation.







Abstract
The synthesis of small organic molecules with a difluoromethylated stereocenter is particularly attractive in drug discovery. Herein, we have developed an efficient method for the direct generation of difluoromethylated stereocenters through Ni0&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction also represents the enantioselective construction of carbon(sp3)&#8722;silicon bonds with nickel catalysis, which provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical synthesis route of high&#8208;value optically active &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes. This protocol features readily available starting materials and commercial chiral catalysis, broad substrates spanning a range of functional groups with high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). The enantioenriched products undergo a variety of stereospecific transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed.

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and Its Highly Permeable Membrane for Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatics&#8208;permeable membranes made from polydimethylsiloxane with tunable side group mobilities are reported by Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111810). Phenyl groups were introduced as rigid molecular spacers to endow the methyl with high mobility and reconstruct the polymer conformation, creating a highway for fast transport of aromatics molecules, and thus realizing efficient removal of aromatic compounds from aqueous solution.

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiently hyperpolarizing of proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPolPOK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on a 12.76 kDa U&#8208;  13  C,  15  N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8 T) and fast MAS frequencies (up to 40 kHz). The performance of cAsymPolPOK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations. This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of  13  C&#8208;  13  C and  15  N&#8208;  13  C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.</dc:description>

This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of  13  C-  13  C and  15  N-  13  C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transformation of Covalent Organic Frameworks from N&#8208;Acylhydrazone to Oxadiazole Linkages for Smooth Electron Transfer in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxadiazole&#8208;linked covalent organic framework has been constructed through oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;acylhydrazone linkage. Both chemical stability and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization are significantly improved, thus upgrading photocatalytic hydrogen generation. This work provides facile protocols for the modulation of photophysical properties for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are regarded as new platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion due to their tailor&#8208;made functions and pre&#8208;designable structures. Their intrinsic reversibility and the high polarization of organic linkages inevitably result in poor chemical stability and weak optoelectronic properties. Herein, one N&#8208;acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COF (H&#8208;COF) was converted into a stable and &#960;&#8208;conjugated oxadiazole&#8208;linked COF via post&#8208;oxidative cyclization. Both chemical stability and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization throughout the reticular framework are significantly improved, leading to a high hydrogen evolution rate of 2615&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 upon visible light irradiation, which is over four times higher than that of H&#8208;COF. This work provides a facile protocol for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs and the modulation of photophysical properties for photocatalytic application.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Lattice Intergrown and Robust MOF Membranes for Polyol Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown (HIL) MOF membranes were synthesized, with an integration of two distinct network MOFs, namely MIL&#8208;53 (Al) and amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr), at the molecular scale. The complementary growth, concomitant with a close connection between two lattices, creates a highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. The HLI MOF membrane displays excellent pervaporation dehydration performances for aqueous polyol solutions, and can deal with tough separation situations.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are frequently used in gas separations, but rare in pervaporation for liquid chemical upgrading, especially for separating water from polyols, due to lack of highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. Here, we report hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown membranes in which amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr) particles embedded into the micro&#8208;gaps of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) rod arrays after secondary growth. By means of high&#8208;resolution TEM and two&#8208;dimensional topologic simulation, the connection between these two distinct MOF lattices at the molecular&#8208;level and their crystallographic geometry harmony is identified, which leads to a close&#8208;knit structure at the crystal boundaries of membranes. Typically, the membrane shows a separation factor as high as 13&#8201;000 for a 90/10 ethanediol/water solution in pervaporation, yields polymer&#8208;grade ethanediol, and saves ca. 32&#8201;% of energy consumption vs. vacuum distillation. It has a highly robust micro&#8208;architecture, with great tolerance to high pressure, durability against ultrasonic therapy and long&#8208;term separation stability over 600&#8197;h.

         <title>H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;Type Global Aromaticity in a 3D Fully Conjugated Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;type global aromaticity was observed in a 3D fully conjugated molecular cage at different oxidation states. The dication 12+ has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; the tetracation 14+ has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic.







Abstract
Global aromaticity in 3D &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular cages remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a fully conjugated molecular cage (1) containing two bridged triphenylamine units and three quinoidal bithiophene arms. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR/ESR measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: 1) its dication (12+) has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; 2) its tetracation (14+) has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic; and 3) its hexacation (16+) has a closed&#8208;shell nature and shows local aromaticity. The study demonstrated a close relationship between 2D H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity and 3D global &#960;&#8208;aromaticity.

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Cascade Combining a Hydration Catalyst with an Amine Dehydrogenase: Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An encapsulated gold carbene complex was combined with a free amine dehydrogenase (GkAmDH) as a co&#8208;catalyst, enabling a cascade synthetic route to directly access chiral amines from propargylethers. This process, combining an initial gold carbene catalyzed hydration of propargylethers to ketones followed by a subsequent reductive amination, produces a wide range of chiral amines in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal catalysis can complement synthetic gaps only in a chemical or biological process. However, the intrinsic mutual deactivation between enzymatic and chemical species is a significant challenge in a single operation. To address the above issue, we developed an encapsulated Au/carbene combined with a free amine dehydrogenase as a co&#8208;catalyst system that enables an efficient hydration/amination enantioselective cascade process to be accomplished. The mechanistic investigation discloses dual catalysis comprised of alkyne hydration, followed by a reductive amination process.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as  1  &#951;  &#8208; or  5  &#951;  &#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent  p  &#8208;block element chemistry.</dc:description>

Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin-centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter and computations attest tin-located &#963;-donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron-rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as  1  &#951;  - or  5  &#951;  -type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low-valent  p  -block element chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for Visible Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interests in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for visible light&#8208;involved Li&#8208;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8208;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8208;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13 V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96 V in dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19 V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surface are extremely desired for various applications, especially in room temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO  2  at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H  2  &#8208;TPCOF was designed with largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M = Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO  2  with one of the highest sensitivity in all reported 2D materials and COF materials, ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8 ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Circularly Polarized Ambient Phosphorescence from Bischromophoric Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long&#8208;lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution processable polymer films of the  trans  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emission with high phosphorescence quantum yield (~18% in air and 46% under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|g  lum  | ~ 4.0 x 10  &#8208;3  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Light/force&#8208;sensitive 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites: from highly efficient blue afterglow to white phosphorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, new types of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) with blue room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were obtained from InCl  3  and aniline hydrochloride. These are highly sensitive to external light and force stimuli. RTP quantum yield of PA6InCl9 can be enhanced from 25.2% to 42.8% upon illumination. Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2 s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100% can be realized when Sb  3+  was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb  3+  . Thus, this work not only overcomes long&#8208;standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high&#8208;efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  are important in industrial applications, but it was great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu 2  O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu 2  O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with the turnover number (TON) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13  C isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu 2  O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The successful topochemical polymerization of bis(selenocyanatomethyl)butadyine    1    is achieved upon association in a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal with 1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (2&#8208;bpen) through strong and linear (NC)&#8722;Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N  Py  chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions, allowing for an appropriate parallel alignment of the diacetylene moieties toward the solid state reaction. Co&#8208;crystal    1    &#8226;(2&#8208;bpen) undergoes polymerization upon heating at 100&#176;C. The reaction progress was followed by IR, DSC and PXRD. An enhancement of the polymer conductivity by 8 orders of magnitude is observed upon iodine doping. Strikingly, the course of polymerization is accompanied with sublimation of the ChB acceptor molecules 2&#8208;bpen, providing the polymer in a pure form with full recovery of the co&#8208;former, at variance with the usual hydrogen bonded co&#8208;crystal strategies toward polydiacetylenes.</dc:description>

Strikingly, the course of polymerization is accompanied with sublimation of the ChB acceptor molecules 2-bpen, providing the polymer in a pure form with full recovery of the co-former, at variance with the usual hydrogen bonded co-crystal strategies toward polydiacetylenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport Between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have drawn considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often   self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules to probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the  presence of stronger interaction between amine units and central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules, which has a modified effect on the dipole direction of porphyrins  to be quantized as  homogeneously large polarons (HLPs)  in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance as high as 24.2%. This work firstly proves that the modulation of intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Disulfide Bond Self&#8208;Heals Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized polyurethane is used as an additive to self&#8208;heal a CsPbIBr2 film by a disulfide&#8208;exchange reaction upon heat treatment. The inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 10.61&#8201;% with efficiency recovery after heat treatment.







Abstract
One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light, etc. Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61&#8201;% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in an air atmosphere over 80&#8197;days and persistent heat attack (85&#8201;&#176;C) over 35&#8197;days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via photocontrolled radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP) is developed. A variety of acrylates or acrylamides can be copolymerized with the macrocyclic allylic sulfone with near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios at all feed compositions. The unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by sulfur dioxide in rROCCP was resolved by reducing the solubility of sulfur dioxide.







Abstract
Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically chiral SuFEx (sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange) click reaction was used to produce a series of configurationally chiral high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. This step&#8208;growth polymerization occurs with high efficiency and enantiospecifically (ee&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced via this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding MnPS up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &#272; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNO3 is reported to dissolve at concentrations up to 0.7&#8197;M in ethylene carbonate (EC) without need for additives. We show further that various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes can be upgraded with LiNO3 to yield practical batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7&#8197;M LiNO3 without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility. We demonstrate the significance of our findings by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO3, which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes. Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.

Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost-effective approach towards practical LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quadruple helicene having two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92 sp2 carbon atoms. It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848&#8197;nm and 977&#8197;nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Truly&#8221; two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanobots based on graphene oxide and powered by enzymes have been fabricated by facile noncovalent interactions. The 2D nanobots can be propelled at ultralow H2O2 concentrations and show chemotactic behavior. Furthermore, in the presence of fuel, they showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye for environmental remediation.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus requires a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003&#8201;% H2O2). The 2D nanobots exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiIII&#8208;NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni2+ in NiII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8722;O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni2+ metal centers (t2g6eg2) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (NiII&#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) for NiIII&#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in NiIII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni3+ sites with the intermediate LiO2 promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 in the void space among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O2 battery based on NiIII&#8208;NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O2 batteries and beyond.

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208; and acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclopropanation of naphthols from cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening has been described. The reaction is scalable and highly chemoselective, and the vinyl cyclopropane products can be uniquely diversified. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

The polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes by neutral racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal catalysts affords perfect isotactic functional polystyrenes. Furthermore, the copolymerization of styrene with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrene produces gradient and random copolymer, respectively. The poison effect of the polar group on the catalysts is dramatically reduced by fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment around the active species.







Abstract
Syndioselective polymerization of unprotected polar styrenes has achieved great success via specially designed catalysts and the establishment of &#8220;self&#8208;assisted&#8221; theory. In contrast, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has remained less explored. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (mmmm&gt;99&#8201;%) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8211;100&#8197;mol&#8201;% by changing their loading ratios. The resultant isotactic polar polystyrenes are quantitatively transformed into hydroxyl or methylsulfonyl polystyrenes with high Tgs. DFT calculations reveal the isospecific mechanism.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &#963;&#8208;donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low&#8208;coordinate, cationic GeII and SnII ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni0, despite being &#963;&#8208;donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni0 complexes, [PhRDippENi(PPh3)3]+ (4&#8201;a/b (Ge) and 5 (Sn); PhRDipp={[Ph2PCH2SiR2](Dipp)N}&#8722;; R=Ph, iPr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic EII centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH3. Further, the GeII centre in 4&#8201;a/b readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF6]&#8722; to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex PhRDippGe(F)Ni(PPh3)3 9, despite this GeII centre simultaneously being a &#963;&#8208;donating ligand towards Ni0. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of 4 and 5 in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.

         <title>Supported &#963;&#8208;Complexes of Li&#8722;C Bonds from Coordination of Monomeric Molecules of LiCH3, LiCH2CH3 and LiC6H5 to Mo&#8803;Mo Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
The coordination of monomeric LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and LiC6H5 molecules to a Mo2 core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X&#8208;ray and computational studies.







Abstract
LiCH3 and LiCH2CH3 react with the complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(thf)2] (1&#8901;thf) with coordination of two molecules of LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and formation of complexes [Mo2{&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)CH2R}2(AdDipp2)2], 5&#8901;LiCH3 and 5&#8901;LiCH2CH3, respectively (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; thf=C4H8O). Due to steric hindrance, only one molecule of LiC6H5 adds to 1&#8901;thf generating the complex [Mo2(H){&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)C6H5}(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2], (4&#8901;LiC6H5). Computational studies disclose the existence of five&#8208;center six&#8208;electron bonding within the H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C&#8722;Li metallacycles, with a mostly covalent H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C group and predominantly ionic Li&#8722;C and Li&#8722;H interactions. However, the latter bonds exhibit non&#8208;negligible covalency, as indicated by X&#8208;ray, computational data and the large one&#8208;bond 6,7Li,1H and 6,7Li,13C NMR coupling constants found for the three&#8208;atom H&#8722;Li&#8722;C chains. By contrast, the phenyl group in 4&#8901;LiC6H5 coordinates in an &#951;2 fashion to the lithium atom through the ipso and one of the ortho carbon atoms.

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) enables production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 compatible with existing industrial processes. Herein we demonstrate the advantages of a methanation active catalyst, including superior activity, favorable temperature profile, and suppression of carbon formation.







Abstract
Utilization of CO2 is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. The reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO2 by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel&#8208;type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H2&#8201;:&#8201;CO2 in a ratio of 2.25 at 10&#8197;barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#8201;&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH4 as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions&#8208;free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H2/CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.

         <title>The First Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, and Its Acetylene Capture Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, uses earth&#8208;friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.







Abstract
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers). HUMs are of practical interest because of their benchmark gas separation performance for several industrial gas mixtures. We report herein design and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the prototypal sulfate&#8208;linked HUM, the fsc topology coordination network ([Zn(tepb)(SO4)]n), SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, tepb=(tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene). Alignment of the sulfate anions enables strong binding to C2H2 via O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC interactions but weak CO2 binding, affording a new benchmark for the difference between C2H2 and CO2 heats of sorption at low loading (&#916;Qst=24&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Dynamic column breakthrough studies afforded fuel&#8208;grade C2H2 from trace (1&#8201;:&#8201;99) or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H2/CO2 mixtures, outperforming its SiF62&#8722; analogue, SIFSIX&#8208;22&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu0&#8211;CuI Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst was constructed for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Cu nanoparticles (NPs) derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces and CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces show a tandem effect during the CO2RR process. A high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on this tandem catalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 on a polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt;2&#8201;e&#8722;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst for the production of C2+ products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu0&#8208;PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C2+ selectivity, whereas CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C2+ selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new topology diagram was developed for the efficient and designed synthesis of 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D sp2&#8208;carbon materials via a C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and exhibit two&#8208;photon up&#8208;conversion luminescence, create novel 2D semiconductors with low band gaps yet tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretical maxima.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress over the past decade, most polycondensation systems even upon a small structural variation of the building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than the desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers, and develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond&#8208;formation polycondensation reaction. The new sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low band gap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and strain engineering combined. The combination of two engineered enzymes (a methyltransferase and an ammonia lyase) and an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain (for regeneration of the SAM cofactor) has been developed to enable a fully biocatalytic one&#8208;pot methylation&#8211;hydroamination cascade. As an example, the synthesis of l &#8208;veratrylglycine from renewable lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid has been demonstrated, in high yield and excellent ee.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be exploited to produce high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial E.&#8197;coli strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM in&#8197;vivo, and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the l&#8208;DOPA precursor l&#8208;veratrylglycine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.

         <title>The Interplay between Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Furan Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry for Sustainable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass&#8208;derived furanic platform molecules have emerged as promising building blocks for renewable chemicals and functional materials. To this aim, the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) cycloaddition stands out as a versatile strategy to convert these renewable resources in highly atom&#8208;efficient ways. Despite nearly a century worth of examples of furan DA chemistry, clear structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stability relationships are still to be established. Detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in these very particular [4+2] cycloadditions is essential to push further development and truly expand the scope beyond the ubiquitous addend combinations of electron&#8208;rich furans and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Herein, we provide pertinent examples of DA chemistry, taken from various fields, to highlight trends, establish correlations and answer open questions in the field with the aim to support future efforts in the sustainable chemicals and materials production.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic C&#8208;to&#8208;C Protein Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N&#8208;to&#8208;C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of  L  &#8208;/  D  &#8208; or &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;amino acid junctions, we find C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;ethylenediamine (Leu&#8208;Eda) motifs to be  bona fide  mimetics of native N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu sequences. Appending a C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein&#8208;splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8211;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;  oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than  O  &#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite of indisputable advances,  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of interglycosidic C&#8211;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides  via  catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activations. Thus, a combinatorial wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides was readily available by palladium&#8208;catalysed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a  trans&#8208;  stereoselectivity for the C(sp  3  )&#8211;H glycosylation. The C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation manifold of glycosides was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3 nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules. However, studies of these materials have not been done, because their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic dendrimers onto host acidic dendrimers, the dendrimer&#8208;assembled&#8208;dendrimers were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule containing multiple imine ligands served as a scaffold for metal precursors and enabled a precise synthesis of metal quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles&#160;  via  &#160;formation of multinuclear complexes. The construction of this new class of supramolecules and the precise synthesis of the quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles are described along with a discussion about the effectivity of this new concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Unified Access to Carbon Radicals from Aliphatic&#160;Alcohols by Cost&#8208;Efficient Titanium&#8208;Mediated Homolytic C&#8211;OH Bond&#160;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent Ti&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;O bond cleavage offers unified access to carbon radicals from ubiquitous non&#8208;activated tertiary, secondary, and even primary alcohols. In contrast to the representative Ti reagents, which were ineffective for this purpose, "TiCl  2  (cat)"/Zn (cat = catecholate) was found to be specifically active. This method was applied to the addition reactions of radicals to alkenes and exhibited high generality and yields. More than 50 combinations were examined. The excellent cost&#8208;efficiency and accessibility of "TiCl  2  (cat)"/Zn further enhance its applicability. Control experiments proved the presence of a carbon radical intermediate and excluded the pathway via alkyl chlorides. Further mechanistic study indicated that the 1:2 complex of alkoxide (R&#8211;O  &#8211;  ) and Ti(III) is an active species in the C&#8211;O cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Engineering toward the Trade&#8208;off between Stability and Activity in Cluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag  21  nanoclusters, namely [Ag  21  (H  2  BTCA)  3  (O  2  PPh  2  )  6  ]SbF  6  (  1  ) and [Ag  21  (C&#8801;CC  6  H  3  &#8208;3,5&#8208;R  2  )  6  (O  2  PPh  2  )  10  ]SbF  6  (  2  ) (H  4  BTCA =  p  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene, R = OMe). Both Ag  21  possess identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that  1  is an 8&#8208;electron cluster and  2  has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P&#8208;symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO&#8208;1 and HOMO states in  1  , and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D&#8208;character, indicating  1  is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S  2  1P  6  while  2  has an incomplete shell configuration 1S  2  1P  2  . These two Ag  21  clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and  1  is robust even at 90&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30% H  2  O  2  ). Significantly,  2  exhibits much higher activity than  1  as catalysts in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can interfere the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Amides with Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8722;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI  2  mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8208;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene mediated C&#8208;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;-polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI  2  mediated deoxygenative cross-coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C-H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;-polyfluoroaryl amines.

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entity beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8208;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ions accumulation, while direct measuring the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. &#160;Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8208;2 &#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction of classical resistance&#8208;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5 times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via Pd(II)/Pd(IV) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in  anti  &#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under Pd catalysis. Detailed optimization of reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [  n  +2] (  n  = 3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through Pd/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct Pd(II)/Pd(IV) mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This distinction results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8211;H Bonds via Reversible &#951;6&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a convenient method for benzylic H/D exchange of a wide variety of substrates bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary C&#8211;H bonds via a reversible &#951;  6  &#8208;coordination strategy. A doubly cationic [Cp  CF3  Rh(III)]  2+  catalyst that serves as an arenophile facilitates deprotonation of inert benzylic hydrogen atoms (p  K  a  &gt; 40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in  &#945;  &#8208;positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /Cu&#8208;BTC, Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /Fe,Co&#8208;PBA, Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /ZIF&#8208;8, and Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /ZIF&#8208;67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity.

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88% conversion and 70% enantioselectivity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the TOF of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene  1  featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of  1  with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene  2  , which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to  1  ,  2  readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in  2  also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording  3  and  5  . The formation of  5  represents the first example of the cleavage of aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single atom center.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Supramolecule via Hydrogen Bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking for Ultrahigh Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, the reported electrode materials for ZIBs are facing the shortcomings including low capacity and unsatisfactory cycling stability etc. Herein, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;quione (HATNQ) is reported for aqueous ZIBs. The HATNQ electrodes delivered an ultrahigh capacity (482.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding cyclability of &gt;10000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . The capacity sets new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions out of plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn  2+  /H  +  , particularly the storage of Zn  2+  , due to the more favorable O&#183;&#183;&#183;Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;N coordination in HATNQ.</dc:description>

         <title>Passerini&#8208;Smiles Reaction of a&#8208;Ketophosphonates: Platform for Phospha&#8208;Brook/Smiles Embedded Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT:  The Passerini&#8208;Smiles reactions of a  &#8208;ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with Phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. When using 4&#8208;nitrophenols a rare 1,3&#8208;Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2&#8208;Nitroderivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a s&#8208;p metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N&#8208;aryl a&#8208;ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza&#8208;Nazarov access to hydroxy&#8208;indolones.</dc:description>

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered phase&#8208;change materials in the Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te system are widely used in data storage and are the subject of intense research to understand the quantum&#8208;chemical origin of their unique properties. To uncover the nature of the underlying periodic wavefunction, we study the interacting atomic orbitals including their phases by means of crystal orbital bond index and fragment crystal orbital analysis. In full accord with findings based on projected force constants, we demonstrate the role of multicenter bonding along straight atomic connectivities. While the here found multicenter bonding resembles three&#8208;center&#8208;four&#8208;electron bonding in molecules, its solid&#8208;state manifestation leads to distinct long&#8208;range consequences, thus serving to contextualize the material properties usually termed &#8220;metavalent&#8221;. Eventually we suggest multicenter bonding to be the origin of their astonishing bond&#8208;breaking and phase&#8208;change behavior, as well as the too small &#8220;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8221; gaps between individual layers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis. The reaction proceeds in water to provide significant yields of the two widely divergent chemical motifs. Additionally, the reaction of thiohydantoin and glyoxylate produces thioorotate in high yield under neutral aqueous conditions. The use of an open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivative also enables the potential pre&#8208;positioning of a nucleosidic bond prior to the synthesis of an orotate nucleoside. The observation that diverse building blocks of modern metabolism can be produced in a single reaction pot, from common reactants under mild conditions, supports the plausibility of orthogonal chemistries operating at the origins of chemical evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;d orbital hybridization induced by monodispersed Ga site on Pt3Mn nanocatalyst boosts ethanol electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing monodispersed metal site in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy to advance fundamental interface study on monodispersed metal site tailored Pt&#8208;based nanoctalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization to regulate the interfacial physico&#8208;chemical property. Serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the monodispersed Ga site on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn) covered with high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41 times of specific activities than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p&#8722;d orbital hybridized interface not only promote the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;breaking and rapid oxidation of &#8208;OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work disclosed a promising strategy to construct a novel active and stable nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenylazaarenes via Cooperative Photoredox and Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition to activated olefins has been widely used to access enantioenriched molecules containing stereocentres at the &#946;&#8208;position of the olefin activating groups. Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical&#8208;based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N&#8208;arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted stereocentres. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition to activated olefins has been widely used to access enantioenriched molecules containing stereocentres at the &#946;-position of the olefin activating groups. Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical-based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N-arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl-, alkyl- and silyl-substituted stereocentres. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H-bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Acetylene Batteries for Electricity Generation and Electrochemical Acetylene Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The available processes for removing acetylene impurities from crude ethylene are tremendously energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C  2  H  2  + Zn + H  2  O &#8594; C  2  H  4  + ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14 V and a peak power density of 2.2 mW cm  &#8208;2  , which exceed those of reported Zn&#8208;CO  2  batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97% and continuously produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene with only ~3 ppm acetylene during a long&#8208;term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Copper(I) Halides for High Efficiency Second Harmonic Generation with a Broadband Transparency Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) with intrinsic noncentrosymmetry have shown great promise for applications in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO). However, established chiral HOMHs often suffer from their relatively small bandgaps, which lead to negative impacts on transparent window and laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Here, we have synthesized two&#160;chiral HOMHs based on Cu(I) halides, namely (  R  &#8208;  /S&#8208;  MBA)CuBr  2  , which feature well&#8208;balanced NLO performances with a highly efficient SHG response&#160;outstanding optical transparency, and high LDT. The effective second&#8208;order NLO coefficient of (  R  &#8208;MBA)CuBr  2  has been determined to be ~24.7 pm V  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude higher than their Cu(II) counterparts. This work shows the promising potential of Cu(I) based chiral HOMHs for nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption at &#960;&#8208;Delocalizable Metallodendrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) has attracted interest for applications exploiting the tight spatial control of interaction volume and long wavelength excitation. However, a deficiency of molecules exhibiting higher&#8208;order nPA (n&#8208;photon absorption, n &gt; 2) and a lack of structure&#8208;property studies to define the key structural characteristics needed to optimize higher&#8208;order MPA performance have hindered practical development. We herein report the syntheses of second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero&#8208; and first&#8208;generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption to femtosecond&#8208;pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal&#8208;to&#8208;oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.</dc:description>
