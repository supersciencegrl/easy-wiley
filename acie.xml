         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). In contrast to the general trend in terminal halogenation of electron acceptors, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, featuring fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregate compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with more organized active layer morphology and denser molecular packing, resulting in improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#180;10&#8208;12 A cm&#8208;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8208;920 nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#180;1014 Jones at 800 nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge&#160;challenge&#160;because of the stability of extractants.&#160;Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH)&#160;generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#160;activation results in unsatisfactory &#8226;OH utilization and organics removal.&#160;Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and&#160;F&#160;sites activate&#160;H2O2, shortening the migration distance&#160;of &#8226;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)&#160;extraction wastewater degradation experiment&#160;showed that F site&#160;with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to&#160;H2O2,&#160;facilitating the continuous generation of &#8226;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2&#160;activation.&#160;As a result, 96.49% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater&#160;and 90.26% total organic carbon&#160;in real&#160;extraction wastewater&#160;were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst&#160;exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides&#160;an effective strategy&#160;for&#160;Fenton&#8208;like&#160;reaction&#160;to&#160;treat&#160;refractory extraction wastewater, promoting&#160;sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of&#160;Covalent Organic Frameworks with Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt for C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received great attention for their unique features, but the limited building blocks restrict their structural diversity and performance exploration. Reticular chemistry provides guidance for the structural expansion and performance regulation of COFs. Herein, we constructed two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt, denoted as UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;2, via [4+2] imine condensation with diamine building blocks of different length. Theoretical simulations combined with experimental results reveal that UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks, narrower pore sizes, and stronger host&#8208;guest interactions has better C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities. This work provides a new evidence for the performance regulation of isoreticular COFs with modular and tunable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group translocation is undoubtedly a pivotal synthetic transformation in organic chemistry. Numerous types of reactions involving radical 1,2&#8208;aryl or 1,4&#8208;aryl migration via electron transfer mechanism have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, energy&#8208;transfer enabled 1,4&#8208;arylation remains unknown. Herein we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The newly developed mild protocol exhibits tolerance towards diverse functional groups and enables the migration of a multitude of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;rich functional groups. The open&#8208;shell strategy has also found successful application in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported the involvement of radical species in this di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement and have also provided evidence for the energy transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Barium Promoter Enormously Enhanced Non&#8208;noble Metal Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a well&#8208;established topic, single&#8208;atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single&#8208;atom form, the intrinsic roles of single&#8208;atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst achieves extremely high H2 production rate of 138.3 mmolH2&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;min&#8722;1 at very low temperature (500 &#176;C, GHSV = 840,000 mL&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 exhibits excellent durability during the 350 h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Both Y2O3 and Co demonstrate positive interactions with Ba, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Ba species at high temperatures (&#8805; 600 &#176;C). Ba single atoms significantly enhance the charge density of Co and form additionally active Co&#8208;O&#8208;Ba&#8208;Y2O3 interfacial sites, which alleviates hydrogen poisoning and decreases the reaction barrier of the N&#8208;H bond activation of *NH. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and selectivity of ~99% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic Cell with Molecular Biomimetic Thylakoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) using a molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) can split water into hydrogen and oxygen at a low driving voltage (1.1&#8197;V) and mild conditions. By temporally and spatially coupling light and dark reactions, the APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1&#8201;%, showcasing the potential of artificial photosynthetic system.







Abstract
The construction of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion system by mimicking the photosynthetic network of the chloroplast holds great promise on efficient solar energy utilization. We developed an artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) based on molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltage (1.1&#8197;V) and neutral condition (pH&#8776;7). The CoTPP&#8208;FePy can emulate the light reaction in thylakoids to produce O2 by coupling light harvesting, photocatalysis, and electron/energy storage (FeIII/FeII&#8722;Py). Subsequently, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were employed to simulate the dark reaction, wherein the proton, electron and energy generated by the light reaction can drive the H2 producing process. By a temporally and spatially coupling of the light and dark reactions, the resulting APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1&#8201;%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrating the potential of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;Catalyzed, Photochemical Conversion of Dehydroalanine into 4,5&#8208;Dihydroxynorvaline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin catalysis under visible light irradiation unlocks the first synthetic method for converting dehydroalanine (Dha) into 4,5&#8208;dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv). The strategy relies on hydrogen bond abstraction from a masked 1,2&#8208;diol precursor by the excited flavin catalyst and subsequent radical addition to Dha. Various peptide substrates are compatible, and a mild deprotection protocol releases the free unnatural amino acid residue.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of unnatural amino acids (UAA) is a key strategy for preparing designed peptides, including pharmaceutically active compounds. Alterations of existing amino acid residues such as dehydroalanine (Dha) are particularly important since selected positions can be addressed without the necessity of a complete de novo synthesis. The intriguing UAA 4,5&#8208;dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv) is found in a variety of naturally occurring peptides and biologically active compounds. However, no method is currently available to modify an existing peptide with this residue. We report the use of flavin catalysts and visible light irradiation for this challenge, which serves as a versatile strategy for converting Dha into Dnv. Our study shows that excited flavins are competent hydrogen atom abstraction catalysts for ethers and acetals, which allows masked 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethylene functionalization from 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The masked diol was successfully coupled to Dha residues, and a series of Dnv&#8208;containing products is reported. A mild and orthogonal protocol for deprotection of the acetal group was also identified, allowing free Dnv&#8208;modified peptides to be obtained. This method provides a straightforward strategy for Dnv functionalization, which is envisioned to be crucial for accessing natural products and synthetic analogues with pharmaceutical activity.

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart weapons. The diazo group is an interesting tool in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology due to its selective and versatile reactivity. We show that chemically stable diazo peptides, which even tolerate 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid, can be generated and used as high&#8208;precision chemical tools.







Abstract
Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH&#8197;1&#8211;14 as amides and from pH&#8197;1&#8211;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Stereoselective Vinylic C&#8722;H Addition via Metallaphotoredox Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallaphotoredox migration strategy has been developed to achieve stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This innovative method employs a chiral nickel catalyst in conjunction with a photocatalyst to facilitate a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration, utilizing readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials.







Abstract
Geometrically defined allylic alcohols with SE, SZ, RE and RZ stereoisomers serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry, attributed to the stereoselective transformations enabled by the alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. When an ideal scenario presents itself with four distinct stereoisomers as potential products, the simultaneous control vicinal stereochemistry in a single step would offer a direct pathway to any desired stereoisomer. Here, we unveil a metallaphotoredox migration strategy to access stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This method harnesses a chiral nickel catalyst in concert with a photocatalyst to enable a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration by using readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials. The efficacy of this methodology is highlighted by the precise construction of all stereoisomers of allylic alcohols bearing analogous substituents and the efficient synthesis of key intermediates en route to Myristinin family. Experimental and computational studies have shed light on pivotal aspects including the synergy of metal catalysis and photocatalysis, the driving forces behind the migration, and the determination of absolute configuration in the C&#8722;H addition process.

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Image Random Nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) Technology Yields Highly Stable and Selective Macrocyclic Peptide Inhibitors for Matrix Metallopeptidase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mirror&#8208;image RaPID (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology was developed for the discovery of innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides. Metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Using MI&#8208;RaPID technology, we identified a highly selective and stable macrocyclic peptide, which consists of D&#8208;amino acids, one &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond, and inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 of 90&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Matrix metallopeptidase&#8197;7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror&#8208;image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology to discover innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7. One identified macrocyclic peptide against D&#8208;MMP7, termed D20, was synthesized in its mirror&#8208;image form, D&#8217;20, consisting of 12 D&#8208;amino acids, one cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond. Notably, it potently inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 value of 90&#8197;nM, and showed excellent selectivity over other MMPs with similar substrate specificity. Moreover, D&#8217;20 inhibited the migration of pancreatic cell line CFPAC&#8208;1, but had no effect on the cell proliferation and viability. D&#8217;20 exhibited excellent stability in human serum, as well as in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. This study highlights that MI&#8208;RaPID technology can serve as a powerful tool to develop in vivo stable macrocyclic peptides for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Dense Lithiophilic Sites as Protective Layer to Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries with remarkable energy densities are restrained by short lifetime and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), resulting from the accumulative Li dendrites and dead Li during cycling. Here, we prepared a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with dense lithiophilic sites (heteoatom weight contents of 32.32wt%) as an anodic protective layer of Li metal batteries. The 3D COF was synthesized using a [6+4] synthesis strategy by inducing flexible 6&#8208;connected cyclotriphosphazene derivative aldehyde and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based tetraphenylamines. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhancing a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition. The Li/Por&#8208;PN&#8208;COF&#8208;Cu cells achieved a record average CE of 99.1% for 320 cycles with smooth Li deposition. Meanwhile, the abundant lithiophilic sites can promote fast Li+ transport with Li+ transference number of 0.87, enabling LiFePO4 full cell with stable stripping/plating processes even at a harsh rate of 5 C. Theoretical calculations revealed that the strong interaction force between Li+ and the COF facilitated the dissolution of Li+ from the electrolyte, and the low migration barrier of 1.08 eV indicated a favorable interaction between the Li+ ions and the &#960;&#8208;electron system.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Redox Chemistry of Cobalt Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementally matched 55Co (PET imaging)/58mCo (therapy) radioisotope pair is suitable for tandem diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Modulation of the Co2+/3+ redox couple is facile in mild oxidative conditions compatible with radiopharmaceutical synthesis, including radiolysis by the isotope's endogenous decay properties. Redox control at tracer scale provides access to the varied and unexplored functionality of 2+ and 3+ 55/58mCo complexes.







Abstract
The elementally matched 55Co2+/3+ (t1/2=17.53&#8197;h, I&#946;+=77&#8201;%)/58mCo2+/3+ (t1/2=9.10&#8197;h, internal conversion=100&#8201;%) radioisotope pair is of interest for development of paired diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Due to the accessibility of the nat/55Co2+/3+ redox couple, the redox state can be readily modulated. Here, we show that macroscopic and radiochemical redox reactions can be closely monitored and controlled using spectroscopic and radiochemical methods. We employ model systems to inform how to selectively synthesize thermodynamically favored oxidation state coordination complexes. In addition to exogenous oxidants, our data indicates that 55Co&#8208;induced radiolysis of water efficiently and directly drives selective oxidation to the 55Co3+ species under no&#8208;carrier added (n.c.a.) conditions. Our synthetic strategies subsequently stabilize the respective 55Co2+ or 55Co3+ species for targeted positron emission tomography imaging in a mouse tumor model.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Hyponitrite Reactivity: The Fe&#8208;hyponitrite complex 3 was generated from preformed hyponitrite and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Upon protonation or oxidation, quantitative N2O formation occurs. Lewis acidity of iron plays a key role in reactivity, as a more Lewis acidic iron center leads to the cleavage of the N=N bond of hyponitrite.







Abstract
Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite many efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Multiblock Polymers by Modulating the Branch Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform for recyclable multiblock polymers has been explored, facilitating the production of various polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers with adjustable side chain mobility. This approach allows for tuning of thermal and mechanical properties while preserving high melting temperatures and consistent morphology. Additionally, this method advances the research of recyclable adhesive materials and selective recycling processes.







Abstract
Developing plastics that fill the need of polyolefins yet are more easily recyclable is a critical need to address the plastic waste crisis. However, most efforts in this vein have focused on high&#8208;density polyethylene (PE), while many different types of PE exist. To create broadly sustainable PE with modular properties, we present the synthesis, characterization, and demonstration of materials applications for chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers prepared from distinct hard and soft blocks using ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative polymerization. By altering the branching pattern within the soft blocks, a series of PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers were synthesized with tunable glass transition temperatures (Tg) while maintaining consistent high melting temperatures (Tm). A clear U&#8208;shape trend between Tg and mechanical properties was found, showcasing their potential as sustainable materials with tailored properties spanning commercial linear low&#8208;density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). These materials offer adjustable adhesive strength to metal and demonstrate chemical recyclability and selective depolymerization in mixed plastic streams, promoting circularity and separation.

         <title>Visualizing Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel NIR phosphors are constructed using a n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n molecular design strategy. Their phosphorescence can be readily modulated by altering the conjugated core structures. When incorporated into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host, these materials exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence ranging from 655&#8211;710&#8197;nm. Analysis of the exciton transition process reveals that the enhanced phosphorescence of the guest originates from the triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host material.







Abstract
Limited by the energy gap law, purely organic materials with efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence are rare and difficult to achieve. Additionally, the exciton transition process among different emitting species in host&#8211;guest phosphorescent materials remains elusive, presenting a significant academic challenge. Herein, using a modular nonbonding orbital&#8208;&#960; bridge&#8208;nonbonding orbital (n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n) molecular design strategy, we develop a series of heavy atom&#8208;free phosphors. Systematic modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores enables the construction of a library with tunable near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence from 655 to 710&#8197;nm. These phosphors exhibit excellent performance under ambient conditions when dispersed into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host matrix, achieving an extended lifetime of 11.25&#8197;ms and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 4.2&#8201;%. Notably, by eliminating the interference from host phosphorescence, the exciton transition process in hybrid materials can be visualized under various excitation conditions. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the improved phosphorescent performance of the guest originates from the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host, rather than from enhanced intersystem crossing efficiency between the guest singlet state and the host triplet state. The findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into constructing novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors and exploring emission mechanisms of host&#8211;guest materials.

         <title>Carbodicarbene&#8208;Stibenium Ion&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic carbodicarbene&#8208;stibenium ion mediates C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking of acetonitrile and terminal alkynes in the presence of an organic base. The resulting adducts were reacted with elemental iodine to functionalize these C&#8722;H bonds in stoichiometric fashion.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group element&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation remains experimentally challenging and the development of clear concepts and design principles has been limited by the increased reactivity of relevant complexes, especially for the heavier elements. Herein, we report that the stibenium ion [(pyCDC)Sb][NTf2]3 (1) (pyCDC=bis&#8208;pyridyl carbodicarbene; NTf2=bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of the base 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp3)&#8722;H bond breaking to generate the stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile complex [(pyCDC)Sb(CH2CN)][NTf2]2 (2). Kinetic analyses were performed to elucidate the rate dependence for all the substrates involved in the reaction. Computational studies suggest that C&#8722;H activation proceeds via a mechanism in which acetonitrile first coordinates to the Sb center through the nitrogen atom in a &#954;1 fashion, thereby weakening the C&#8722;H bond which can then be deprotonated by base in solution. Further, we show that 1 reacts with terminal alkynes in the presence of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking to form stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts of the type [(pyCDC)Sb(CCR)][NTf2]2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f). Compound 1 shows excellent specificity for the activation of the terminal C(sp)&#8722;H bond even across alkynes with diverse functionality. The resulting stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile and stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts react with elemental iodine (I2) to produce iodoacetonitrile and iodoalkynes, while regenerating an Sb trication.

         <title>Hollow Hydrogels for Excellent Aerial Water Collection and Autonomous Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conical hollow hydrogel architecture is reported, which can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water without any external assistance, demonstrating high potential for emergency water collection in arid areas. The hydrogel is biodegradable, and can eventually decompose, and become an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required.







Abstract
Air moisture is a valuable and omnipresent resource of fresh water. However, traditional water collectors come with an enduring problem of the water&#8208;release step, which requires special devices and additional energy to remove the water from the adsorbent, such as heat, sunlight, or both. Herein, we report the first composite conical hollow hydrogel architecture fabricated through a film&#8208;to&#8208;tube transforming protocol, designed to harvest water from aerial humidity. This hollow hydrogel device can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water at room temperature. The entire water collection and release process does not require any external assistance. Therefore, this device is highly suitable for emergency water collection in arid areas. As an exemplary demonstration, positioning the hollow hydrogel device next to a plant turns into an individualized system for irrigation. Since the device is biodegradable, it eventually decomposes and becomes an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required. For long&#8208;term application, the water&#8208;release process can be monitored in real time by an electronic device to indicate the amount of collected water. The hollow hydrogel combines the humidity&#8208;adsorbing capacity with autonomous water release that carries the potential for harvesting water from humidity to address the shortage of fresh water, especially in arid locations where other sources of water are scarce or inaccessible.

         <title>Multiple Resonance Quasi&#8208;fluorescence from BN&#8208;Doped Aromatic Compounds Modified with &#8220;Naphthalene&#8221; Units Approaches the BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>

         <dc:description>
By introducing a prototypical &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon unit, specifically the naphthalene unit, into the structure of a classical blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting molecular framework, we can enhance the bonding properties of the target green emitters to meet the BT.2020 standard without sacrificing their optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Developing fluorophores that conform to the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT.2020) standard presents a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an innovative approach that integrates two and three&#8208;boron/nitrogen (BN2)&#8208;embedded [4]helicene subunits with naphthalene, resulting in the synthesis of two novel narrowband bright green quasi&#8208;fluorescent emitters, NT&#8208;2B and NT&#8208;3B for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. These emitters exhibit minimal reorganization energy and Huang&#8211;Rhys factor, emitting at 510 and 511&#8197;nm in dilute toluene solution with exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum values of 15 and 14&#8197;nm, respectively. Notably, NT&#8208;2B demonstrates an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.5&#8201;%, rapid radiative decay rate, and slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate. Owing to their narrowband emission characteristics and outstanding optoelectronic properties, corresponding OLEDs based on NT&#8208;2B demonstrate a high external quantum efficiency of 30.6&#8201;%, with an FWHM value of 21.5&#8197;nm and a CIEy of 0.74, positioning it as one of the leading narrow&#8208;band green emitters.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Photoswitches for High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and cis&#8208;trans isomerization, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven solid&#8208;state fluorescent photoswitch has been developed. It was obtained by incorporating a bulky naphthalimide group into a salicylaldimine. The photoswitch shows triple fluorescence switching, showing potential application in high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Developing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches in the solid state remains an enormous challenge in smart materials. Such photoswitches are obtained from salicylaldimines through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and subsequent cis&#8208;trans isomerization strategies. By incorporating a bulky naphthalimide fluorophore into a Schiff base, three photoswitches achieve dual&#8208;mode changes (both in color and fluorescence) in the solid state. In particular, the optimal one generates triple fluorescence changing from green, to yellow and finally to orange upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This switching process is fully reversible and can be repeated at least 10&#8197;times without obvious attenuation, suggesting its good photo&#8208;fatigue resistance. Mechanism studies reveal that the naphthalimide group not only enables the tuning of multicolor with an additional emission, but also induces a folded structure, reducing molecular stacking and facilitating ESIPT and cis&#8208;trans isomerization. As such, photopatterning, ternary encoding and transient information recording and erasing are successfully developed. The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.

         <title>Interface Energy&#8208;Level Reorganization for Efficient Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface molecular engineering of perovskites is used to adjust energy levels and block leakage currents from deficient contact barriers under high bias voltage. In this work, detectors treated with strong dipole ligands show enhanced energy resolution (3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays at room temperature) and remain stable under a continuous electric field for over 300&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for gamma&#8208;ray (&#947;&#8208;ray) spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217; leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;100&#8197;V. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date.

&lt;p&gt;Surface molecular engineering of perovskites is used to adjust energy levels and block leakage currents from deficient contact barriers under high bias voltage. In this work, detectors treated with strong dipole ligands show enhanced energy resolution (3.9&#8201;% for &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na 511&#8197;keV &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-rays at room temperature) and remain stable under a continuous electric field for over 300&#8197;minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for gamma-ray (&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-ray) spectrum detectors. However, achieving high-resolution energy spectra in single-photon pulse-height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge-density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217; leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;100&#8197;V. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9&#8201;% for &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na 511&#8197;keV &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-spectrum, representing one of the best &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field (1,000&#8197;V&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for over 300&#8197;minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Metal&#8208;Ion Selectivity Induced by Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Precise Heterometallic Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic architectures usually fail to assemble in a one&#8208;pot method with only one type of organic motif due to its low metal&#8208;ion selectivity. An effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; strategy has new be utilized for the successful and precise construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by the one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions with a tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3, which encodes the definite metal ion sequence.







Abstract
Heterometallic supramolecules, known for their unique synergistic effects, have shown broad applications in photochemistry, host&#8208;guest chemistry, and catalysis. However, there are great challenges to precisely construct heterometallic supramolecules rather than a statistical mixture, due to the limited metal&#8208;ion selectivity of coordination units. In particular, heterometallic architectures precisely encoded with different metal ions usually fail to form in a one&#8208;pot method when only one type of coordinated motif exists due to its poor metal&#8208;ion selectivity. Herein, we propose an effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; (IC&#960;) strategy and successfully constructed the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by the one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3 with Zn(II) and Cu(II), following a clear self&#8208;assembly mechanism in which only thermodynamic dimers ZnL12 and Cu2L22 were constructed with model ligands L1, L2, Zn(II) and Cu(II) with perfect self&#8208;sorting and an ultra&#8208;high metal&#8208;selectivity feature. The successful construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34, in which the definite sequence of metal ions Zn(II) and Cu(II) is encoded in the one&#8208;pot method, will offer a novel approach to precisely construct heterometallic architectures.

         <title>Localized Water Restriction in Ternary Eutectic Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage in extreme conditions due to the small ionic radius and efficient transport of protons. Hydrogen gas, with its low working potentials, fast kinetics, and stability, further enhances the performance of proton batteries but necessitates the development of novel electrolytes with low freezing points and reduced corrosion. This work introduces a localized water restriction strategy by incorporating a tertiary component with a high donor number, which forms strong bonds with water molecules. This approach restricts free water molecules and reduces the average hydrogen bond ratio and strength. As&#8208;prepared ternary eutectic electrolytes lowered the freezing point to &#8722;103 &#176;C, significantly lower than the traditional binary electrolyte (9.5 m H3PO4, &#8722;93 &#176;C). This electrolyte is highly compatible with the Cu0.79Co0.21[Fe(CN)6]0.64&#183;4H2O (CoCuHCF) cathode, reducing material dissolution and current collector corrosion. The H2||CoCuHCF battery using this electrolyte demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 23664.3 W kg&#8722;1, excellent performance at &#8722;80 &#176;C, and stable cyclability over 1000 cycles (&gt; 30 days)&#160; at &#8722;50 &#176;C. These findings provide a framework for proton electrolytes, highlighting the potential of hydrogen batteries in challenging environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Framework&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20% to 95%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Early Detection of High&#8208;altitude Hypoxic Brain Injury by In Vivo Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) is a kind of acute mountain sickness and the survival rate of patients with HHBI can be improved only if it is detected and treated at the early stage. However, limited by speediness and accuracy, it is still very difficult for most of current approaches to realize the early detection of HHBI. We propose herein a novel strategy for this goal based on spatiotemporal changes in the brain oxygen level. As revealed by in vivo electrochemistry, the characteristic changes of brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure are directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the degree of HHBI can be diagnosed by the variation of brain oxygen, making the early detection of HHBI feasible. In addition, the risk of HHBI for mouse exposed to high&#8208;altitude hypoxia environments can be also prognosed days in advance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Bartoli Indole Synthesis by the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes with Nitro(hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the unique charm of dipole chemistry, intercepting N&#8208;O=C dipoles precisely generated by designed processes to develop novel reactivity has become a seminal challenge. The polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species generated through the radical addition of excited nitro(hetero)arenes to alkenes represents a significantly underappreciated mechanism for generating N&#8208;O=C dipoles. Herein, we present a photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. Various indoles and azaindoles are constructed through the multi&#8208;step spontaneous rearrangement of carbonyl imine intermediates generated by the polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations support that the reaction involves radical cycloaddition, ozonolysis&#8208;type cycloreversion, intramolecular H&#8208;shift of carbonyl imines, and 3,3&#8208;sigmatropic shift of O&#8208;Alkenyl hydroxylamines, etc. The implementation of continuous&#8208; flow photochemistry, in particular, significantly enhances efficiency, thereby overcoming obstacles to the commercialization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning proton affinity on Co&#8211;N&#8211;C atomic interface to disentangle activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in acidic oxygen reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2via two&#8208;electron pathway (2e&#8208; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for highly active and selective 2e&#8208; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN4 (Co1&#8208;NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H2O2 formation. As a result, Co1&#8208;NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&#8208; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724 V vs. RHE and H2O2 selectivity of 94%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co1&#8208;NBC exhibits a record&#8208;high H2O2 productivity of 202.7 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and a remarkable stability of 60 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in flow cell. This work provides new insights into resolving activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cycloheptadienones Starting from Phenols and Using a Rhodium/Boron Asymmetric Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing offers a unique route to assemble complex architectures from simple feedstocks that are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the asymmetric version of skeletal editing has not been widely studied. Herein, we present a modular rhodium/boron asymmetric catalytic system that enables ring&#8208;expansion of phenols with cyclopropenes to synthesize highly functionalized cycloheptadienones in excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. This unique protocol features with low&#8208;catalyst loading, atom and step&#8208;economies, and mild neutral reaction conditions. Isotope&#8208;labelling experiments and DFT calculations have been conducted to reveal that boron reagent plays a vital role in the whole catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocycle Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Amphoteric Organic Superstructures for Superior Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple redox&#8208;active amphoteric organics with more n&#8208;p fused electron transfer is an ongoing pursuit for superior zinc&#8722;organic batteries (ZOBs). Here we report multi&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;site donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures (AOSs) by integrating three&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type triazine motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type piperazine units via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. AOSs expose flower&#8208;shaped N&#8208;heteromacrocyclic electron delocalization topologies to promise full accessibility of built&#8208;in n&#8208;p redox&#8208;active motifs with an ultralow activation energy, thus liberating superior capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1) for Zn||AOSs battery. More importantly, the extended multiple donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;fused conjugated AOSs feature satisfied discharge voltage and anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, pushing both the energy density and cycle life of the ZOBs to a new level (412 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles@10 A g&#8722;1). An anion&#8722;cation hybrid 18 e&#8722; charge storage mechanism is rationalized for heteromacrocyclic modules of AOSs cathode, entailing six tert&#8208;N motifs coupling with CF3SO3&#8722; ions at high potential and twelve imine sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential. These findings constitute a major advance of amphoteric multielectron organic materials and stand for a good starting point for advanced ZOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides Facilitates Stereospecific SuFEx Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;centered electrophilic 'warheads' have emerged as key components for chemical proteomic probes through sulfur&#8208;exchange chemistry (SuFEx) with protein nucleophiles. Among these functional groups, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs) stand out for their modifiable sites, tunable electrophilicities, and chiral sulfur&#8208;center, presenting exciting possibilities for new covalent chemical probes. However, the synthetic access to chiral SIFs has been a challenge, limiting their exploration and applications. In this study, we describe a convenient route to obtain chiral SIFs from readily available sulfenamides via a series of one&#8208;pot tandem reactions with high enantiomeric excess (ees). The resulting chiral SIFs were further converted into a diverse array of chiral S(VI) derivatives under mild conditions or in buffer solutions. Most significantly, the specificity of the chiral SIFs in protein ligation experiments underscored the critical role of sulfur&#8208;center chirality in the design and screening of more&#8208;selective covalent probes and therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Dication Disulfuranes as Photoactivatable Sources of Radical Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent development of photoredox and energy transfer catalysis has led to a significant expansion of visible light&#8208;driven chemical transformations. These methods have demonstrated exceptional efficiency in converting a wide range of substrates into radical intermediates and generating open&#8208;shell catalytic species. However, the simplification of catalytic systems and the direct generation of highly reactive radical organocatalysts through direct visible light irradiation from stable precatalysts remains largely an unrealized goal. This challenge is mainly due to the limited availability of precatalysts that are responsive to visible light. Herein, we introduce a new class of bench&#8208;stable dicationic disulfuranes, which release highly reactive thiyl radicals upon blue light excitation. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that this reactivity arises from a combination of structural features and intermolecular interactions. This family of molecules has been employed to catalyze radical cascades previously incompatible with photoredox conditions, enabling the efficient formation of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;hydroxyketones in excellent yields and short reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>I3&#8208;&#8208;Mediated Oxygen Evolution Activities to Boost Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance with Low Charging Voltage and Long Cycling Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal&#8208;air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8208;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8208; to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn&#8208;air battery performs an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I&#8208; mainly generates I3&#8208; on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH&#8208; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8208;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system. This work offers a strategy to simultaneously improve the cycling life and reduce the charging voltage of Zn&#8208;air batteries through redox mediator methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Ring Translocation in a pH&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Driven Tristable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane comprising a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle and a thread containing three recognition sites (ammonium, bipyridinium and triazolium) is described. The ammonium and bipyridinium stations are responsive to orthogonal stimuli, pH and electrochemical, allowing control over the macrocycle movement along the axle. The thermodynamic characterization elucidated the processes driving the operation.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane comprising a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) macrocyclic component and a thread containing three recognition sites: ammonium (AmH+), bipyridinium (Bpy2+) and triazolium (Trz+). AmH+ and Bpy2+ are responsive to fully orthogonal stimuli, pH and electrochemical, which allows to precisely control the directional translation of the macrocycle along the axle. A better understanding of the processes driving the operation of the system was obtained thanks to an in&#8208;depth thermodynamic characterization. Orthogonal stimuli responsive tristable rotaxanes represent the starting point for the creation of linear motors and the development of molecular logic gates.

         <title>Metallic Impurities in Electrolysis: Catalytic Effect of Pb Traces in Reductive Amination and Acetone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the reductive amination of acetone with methylamine as nitrogen source using electrochemistry revealed the catalytic activity of 1&#8197;ppm Pb. In addition, the effects of the applied potential and the cathode materials on the reaction were investigated. Finally, the results were transferred to the electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone.







Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the active species in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1&#8197;ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structured IrOx Foam Platelets as the Building Block of Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets as an active and stable OER electrocatalyst, which enables multiscale tuning of the anodic catalyst layer from atomic to microscopic scales in PEM water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Achieving robust long&#8208;term durability with high catalytic activity at low iridium loading remains one of great challenges for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of iridium oxide foam platelets comprising edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, and demonstrate the structural advantages of this material for multilevel tuning of anodic catalyst layer across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;microscopic scales for PEMWE. The integration of IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, foam&#8208;like texture and platelet morphology into a single material system assures the generation and exposure of highly active and stable iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while facilitating the reduction of both mass transport loss and electronic resistance of catalyst layer. As a proof of concept, the membrane electrode assembly in single&#8208;cell PEMWE based on honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets, with a low iridium loading (~0.3 mgIr/cm2), is demonstrated to exhibit high catalytic activity at ampere&#8208;level current densities and to remain stable for more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular flasks are hollow supramolecular structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions, often exhibiting complex catalytic mechanisms and selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. This Review discusses the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, and showcases the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through their use, focusing on examples relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe this summary will facilitate the design and development of novel catalysis examples inside molecular flasks







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks&#8211;supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.

         <title>&#8220;Boron Ylide&#8221; Enables Stereoselective Construction of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The umpolung of diborodibromomethane (DBDBM) offers a convenient approach to generate &#945;&#8208;bromo &#8220;boron ylide&#8221;. The &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; serves as C1 synthon for cyclopropanation reaction, facilitating the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. Asymmetric cyclopropanation was achieved with the aid of chiral auxiliary. Control experiments exhibit that the boryl groups are essential for the smooth progress of the reaction and the control of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins with &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; is disclosed for the first time, providing a modular strategy for the synthesis of stereospecific diboryl&#8208;functionalized cyclopropanes. The chiral gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes are synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity with the aid of a chiral auxiliary. Based on the powerful transformable ability of boryl group, those challenging multi&#8208;quaternary carbon centers in cyclopropane units have been facilely constructed with excellent stereoselectivity. Control experiments indicate that the boryl groups are necessary for both chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity control.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Enables Anions&#8208;Regulated Solvation Structure for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TEG co&#8208;solvent with two&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions&#8208;involved solvation shell, leads to the formation of a bilayer SEI, consisting of carbon&#8208;rich organic outer and ZnF2&#8208;rich inner layer, protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, their practical application is hindered by the excessive use of zinc anodes and poor high&#8208;temperature performance, caused by severe side reactions and dendritic growth issues. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bidentate coordination of Zn2+ and solvent to tailor the solvation structure. The triethylene glycol (TEG) co&#8208;solvent with two&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions&#8208;involved solvation shell, greatly reducing the activity of coordinated H2O molecules. The sequential reduction of OTF&#8722; anions and TEG leads to the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic bilayer SEI (hydrophobic organic layer and high ion conductivity inorganic layer), protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth, thus ensuring an unprecedented Zn reversibility (99.95&#8201;% over 5000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

&lt;p&gt;The TEG co-solvent with two-oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions-involved solvation shell, leads to the formation of a bilayer SEI, consisting of carbon-rich organic outer and ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich inner layer, protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, their practical application is hindered by the excessive use of zinc anodes and poor high-temperature performance, caused by severe side reactions and dendritic growth issues. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bidentate coordination of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and solvent to tailor the solvation structure. The triethylene glycol (TEG) co-solvent with two-oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions-involved solvation shell, greatly reducing the activity of coordinated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. The sequential reduction of OTF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions and TEG leads to the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic bilayer SEI (hydrophobic organic layer and high ion conductivity inorganic layer), protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth, thus ensuring an unprecedented Zn reversibility (99.95&#8201;% over 5000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). More importantly, the full cells of Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit a record-high cumulative capacity (2552&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio=15&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.9) and a high areal capacity (3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aryl C&#8208;H Fluorocarbonylation with CF2Br2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibromo difluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an abundant and inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8722;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals photocatalyzed, solvent tunable strategy for synthesizing fluorocarbonylated products and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. The diverse transformations of fluorocarbonylated products highlight the utility of this protocol.







Abstract
The use of abundant and inexpensive fluorine feedstocks to synthesize fluorinated compounds is a promising strategy that has not been extensively investigated. Dibromodifluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8722;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals an iridium&#8208;catalyzed, tunable strategy for synthesizing acyl fluorides and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. To achieve the desired products, this process only requires the change of solvent (from DMSO to 1,4&#8208;dioxane) under blue LED illumination. A variety of arenes and heteroarenes with electron&#8208;donating substituents were successfully used, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic experiments revealed that DMSO served a dual role, functioning as both solvent and nucleophilic reagent in C&#8722;H fluorocarbonylation.

         <title>Chemical Synergic Stabilization of High Br&#8208;Content Mixed&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Durable Multi&#8208;Terminal Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Pb Leakage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was incorporated to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic performance and prevent the Pb leakage of high Br&#8208;content wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells via chemical synergistic interaction&#8208;assisted halide stabilization and Pb fixation. The integrated multi&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells realized efficiencies over 24&#8201;%, extended operational lifespan and Pb sequestration efficiency of over 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
High Br&#8208;content lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) of 1.6&#8211;2.0&#8197;eV have showcased vast potential to be used in tandem solar cells. However, WBG perovskites often suffer from severe halide segregation, phase separation and ion migration under the stress of light, heat, moisture and electric bias, which would accelerate the decomposition of perovskite films and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance and even aggravate the lead leakage from damaged devices. Here, we report a novel chemical synergic interaction strategy to mitigate the abovementioned issues in WBG perovskites. To achieve that, a small amount of cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, composed of multiple ammonium cations, chlorine ions and abundant hydroxyl functional groups, was introduced into WBG perovskites, which effectively stabilized the halide ions and homogenized the phase distribution, comprehensively passivated the crystallographic defects, as well as efficiently immobilized the Pb2+ ions. Encouragingly, the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was universal and useful for different WBG perovskite compositions (i.e. 1.68&#8197;eV, 1.79&#8197;eV and 1.99&#8197;eV), which favorably boosted the efficiencies by 10&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% and extended the operational stability of resultant devices to 2680&#8197;h. The four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem and six&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells integrated with different WBG perovskite sub&#8208;cells exhibited efficiencies up to 24.39&#8201;% and 22.42&#8201;%, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted internal chemical encapsulation effectively prevented the Pb leakage when the devices were severely damaged and immersed in water. Surprisingly, there was only 5.63 ppb Pb leaching out for the single&#8208;junction devices, far below than the U.S. standard for safe drinking water (&lt;15&#8197;ppb). The target tandem solar cells with cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modification also realized a Pb sequestration efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under the most adverse environment.

         <title>Harnessing 4f Electron Itinerancy for Integrated Dual&#8208;Band Redox Systems Boosts Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving a balance between catalyst activity and stability is a critical challenge in catalysis. This study proposes the &#8220;electron itinerancy&#8221; mechanism, where the high&#8208;energy, localized f&#8208;bands of rare&#8208;earth elements couple with the broadened d&#8208;bands of transition metals. This creates a flexible &#8220;electron reservoir&#8221; for the reaction process, facilitating temporary storage for electron transfer for ORR and OER reactions.







Abstract
In&#8208;depth comprehension and manipulation of band occupation at metal centers are crucial for facilitating effective adsorption and electron transfer in lithium&#8208;oxygen battery (LOB) reactions. Rare earth elements play a unique role in band hybridization due to their deep orbitals and strong localization of 4&#8201;f electrons. Herein, we anchor single Ce atoms onto CoO, constructing a highly active and stable catalyst with d&#8208;f a dual&#8208;band redox center. It is discovered that the itinerant behavior of 4&#8201;f electrons introduces an enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which facilitates ideal &#963;/&#960; bonding and flexible adsorption between the Ce/Co active sites and *O. Simultaneously, the injection of localized Ce 4&#8201;f electrons strengthens the orbital bonding capacity of Co&#8722;O, effectively inhibits the dissolution of Co sites and improves the structural stability of the cathode material. Bracingly, the Ce1/CoO&#8208;based LOB exhibits an ultra&#8208;low charge&#8211;discharge polarization (0.46&#8197;V) and stable cyclic performance (1088&#8197;hours). This work breaks through the traditional limitations in catalyst activity and stability, providing new strategies and theoretical insights for developing high&#8208;performance LOBs powered by rare&#8208;earth elements.

         <title>Electronic Response and Charge Inversion at Polarized Gold Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new first&#8208;principles&#8208;based simulation method to model the electrified metal&#8208;electrolyte interface has been developed and applied to both Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces in NaCl solution. It reveals that the electronic response of Au electrode contributes significantly to the experimental reported high capacitance and the unexpected instantaneous adsorption of Cl ions at anodic polarized Au (100) (instead at PZC) can lead to a charge inversion.







Abstract
We have studied polarized Au(100) and Au(111) electrodes immersed in electrolyte solution by implementing finite&#8208;field methods in density functional theory&#8208;based molecular dynamics simulations. This allows us to directly compute the Helmholtz capacitance of electric double layer by including both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, and the results turn out to be in excellent agreement with experiments. It is found that the electronic response of Au electrode makes a crucial contribution to the high Helmholtz capacitance and the instantaneous adsorption of Cl can lead to a charge inversion on the anodic polarized Au(100) surface. These findings point out ways to improve popular semi&#8208;classical models for simulating electrified solid&#8211;liquid interfaces and to identify the nature of surface charges therein which are difficult to access in experiments.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Accessing 3D Heterocycles via 1,2&#8208;Dicyanation of Planar N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative functionalization approach of abundant N&#8208;heteroarenes has been developed to harvest valued 3D N&#8208;heterocyclic skeletons. This robust method is enabled by the in situ generation of highly reactive non&#8208;symmetric iodane from bench&#8208;stable hypervalent iodane, PhI(OAc)2, and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 A wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes were transformed into their corresponding 3D analog via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector.







Abstract
The rapid construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic frameworks is a key challenge in contemporary medicinal chemistry. The molecules with three&#8208;dimensional complexity hold a greater probability to improve clinical outcomes, solubility, selectivity for target proteins, and metabolic stability. However, the prevalence of flat molecules persists among new drug candidates, primarily owing to the multitude of chemical methods available for their synthesis. In principle, the dearomative functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene allows for the conversion of readily available planar molecules into partially or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are most significant structural motifs of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Unfortunately, these reactions are very rare because of the inherent challenge imposed by heteroarenes&#8217; poor reactivity, rendering the process thermodynamically unfavorable. Herein, we report a modular approach for accessing 3D chemical space in translating planar heteroarenes into valuable 3D heterocycles via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector. This approach is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive, non&#8208;symmetric iodane by combining cyanide anion and bench&#8208;stable PhI(OAc)2. This reaction represents a rare example of 1,2&#8208;dicyanation of N&#8208;heteroarenes that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug and agrochemical discovery. The transformation is highly selective and amenable to a wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes and late&#8208;stage partial saturation of drugs and agrochemicals.

         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition reaction to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was developed via &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations that are generated in situ through the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals by the organic super&#8208;photoreductant CBZ6. The &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals are formed by the &#946;&#8208;addition of alkyl radicals generated in situ by the photocatalytic fragmentation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and esters.







Abstract
We report the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals of amides or esters to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations through super photoreductant CBZ6 induced redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis. The &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals are formed by the &#946;&#8208;addition of alkyl radicals generated in situ by the photocatalytic fragmentation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and esters. This method enables the &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition of hydroxyl or alkoxyl radicals to amides and esters without any prefunctionalization.

         <title>Indole N&#8208;Linked Hydroperoxyl Adduct of Protein&#8208;Derived Cofactor Modulating Catalase&#8208;Peroxidase Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW&#8208;OOH (golden color). MYW&#8208;OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.

         <title>All&#8208;Atom Protein Sequence Design Based on Geometric Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GeoSeqBuilder successfully design sequences that fold to the desired protein target structures with atomic consistence.







Abstract
Designing sequences for specific protein backbones is a key step in creating new functional proteins. Here, we introduce GeoSeqBuilder, a deep learning framework that integrates protein sequence generation with side chain conformation prediction to produce the complete all&#8208;atom structures for designed sequences. GeoSeqBuilder uses spatial geometric features from protein backbones and explicitly includes three&#8208;body interactions of neighboring residues. GeoSeqBuilder achieves native residue type recovery rate of 51.6&#8201;%, comparable to ProteinMPNN and other leading methods, while accurately predicting side chain conformations. We first used GeoSeqBuilder to design sequences for thioredoxin and a hallucinated three&#8208;helical bundle protein. All the 15 tested sequences expressed as soluble monomeric proteins with high thermal stability, and the 2 high&#8208;resolution crystal structures solved closely match the designed models. The generated protein sequences exhibit low similarity (minimum 23&#8201;%) to the original sequences, with significantly altered hydrophobic cores. We further redesigned the hydrophobic core of glutathione peroxidase 4, and 3 of the 5 designs showed improved enzyme activity. Although further testing is needed, the high experimental success rate in our testing demonstrates that GeoSeqBuilder is a powerful tool for designing novel sequences for predefined protein structures with atomic details. GeoSeqBuilder is available at https://github.com/PKUliujl/GeoSeqBuilder.

         <title>Mn&#8722;Ce Symbiosis: Nanozymes with Multiple Active Sites Facilitate Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Based on Electron Transfer and Confinement Anchoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanozyme inspired by the mutual exchange of nutrients between nitrogen&#8208;fixing bacteria and leguminous plants as well as the confinement of rhizobia colonization within root cells was constructed by confinement anchoring of rhizobium&#8208;like CeOx nanoclusters on root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports, leading to lattice interlacing and electron transfer from Mn2+ to Ce4. CeOx/Mn3O4 showed enhanced ROS scavenging in chemical simulations and cellular environments.







Abstract
Regulating appropriate valence states of metal active centers, such as Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+, as well as surface vacancy defects, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of cerium&#8208;based and manganese&#8208;based nanozymes. Drawing inspiration from the efficient substance exchange in rhizobia&#8208;colonized root cells of legumes, we developed a symbiosis nanozyme system with rhizobia&#8208;like CeOx nanoclusters robustly anchored onto root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports (CeOx/Mn3O4). The process of &#8220;substance exchange&#8221; between Ce and Mn atoms&#8212;reminiscent of electron transfer&#8212;not only fine&#8208;tunes the metal active sites to achieve optimal Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios but also enhances the vacancy ratio through interface defect engineering. Additionally, the confinement anchoring of CeOx on Mn3O4 ensures efficient electron transfer in catalytic reactions. The final CeOx/Mn3O4 nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase&#8208;like (CAT&#8208;like) and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like (SOD&#8208;like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying the efficacy of nanozymes.

&lt;p&gt;A nanozyme inspired by the mutual exchange of nutrients between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and leguminous plants as well as the confinement of rhizobia colonization within root cells was constructed by confinement anchoring of rhizobium-like CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters on root-like Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosupports, leading to lattice interlacing and electron transfer from Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ce&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; showed enhanced ROS scavenging in chemical simulations and cellular environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating appropriate valence states of metal active centers, such as Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as surface vacancy defects, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of cerium-based and manganese-based nanozymes. Drawing inspiration from the efficient substance exchange in rhizobia-colonized root cells of legumes, we developed a symbiosis nanozyme system with rhizobia-like CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters robustly anchored onto root-like Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosupports (CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The process of &#8220;substance exchange&#8221; between Ce and Mn atoms&#8212;reminiscent of electron transfer&#8212;not only fine-tunes the metal active sites to achieve optimal Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios but also enhances the vacancy ratio through interface defect engineering. Additionally, the confinement anchoring of CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; on Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ensures efficient electron transfer in catalytic reactions. The final CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase-like (CAT-like) and superoxide dismutase-like (SOD-like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying the efficacy of nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming the Dynamic Range of Nanochannel Biosensors for MicroRNA Detection through Allosteric DNA Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors are extensively utilized for microRNA detection owing to their high sensitivity and rapid response. However, conventional nanochannel biosensors face limitations in their fixed dynamic range, restricting their versatility and efficacy. Herein, we introduce tunable tri&#8208;block DNA probes with varying affinities for target miRNA to engineer solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors capable of programmable dynamic range adjustment. The tri&#8208;block DNA architecture comprises a poly&#8208;adenine (polyA) block for adjustable surface density anchoring, alongside stem and loop blocks for modulating structural stability. Through systematic manipulation of these blocks, we demonstrate the ability to achieve diverse target binding affinities and detection limits, achieving an initial 81&#8208;fold dynamic range. By combining probes with different affinities, we extend this dynamic range significantly to 10,900&#8208;fold. Furthermore, by implementing a sequestration mechanism, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor was narrowed to only a 3&#8208;fold range of target concentrations. The customizable dynamic range of these advanced nanochannel biosensors makes them highly promising for a broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional bonds integrated strategy is proposed to regulate cathode electrolyte interphase by the trip&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). It endows the 3&#8197;Ah hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 pouch full cell with a capacity retention up to 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8722; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8722; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8722; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3&#8197;Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.

         <title>Chemodivergent Parallel Kinetic Resolution of Paracyclophanes: Enantiomer Fishing with Different Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of catalytic strategy in asymmetric synthesis is disclosed, through which the parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) of the racemic substrate can be realized with two distinct achiral reactants. The current study also represents the seminal investigations on the PKR reaction of racemic compounds bearing planar chirality, the chemodivergent PKR reaction with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, and the catalytic approach for the preparation of chiral pyridines bearing multi&#8208;functionalities.







Abstract
An unprecedented chemodivergent strategy for parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) is disclosed through which two planar chiral products bearing different structures were simultaneously afforded with opposite stereoselectivities. Two achiral esters are activated by one single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to react with the different enantiomers of the racemic imine substrate in a parallel fashion. Two products bearing distinct structures and opposite stereoselectivities are respectively afforded from the same reaction system in good to excellent yields, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Control experiments and kinetic studies are carried out to probe the kinetic and dynamic properties during the reaction progress. The planar chiral pyridine and lactam products show interesting applications in both asymmetric synthesis and pesticide development.

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>

Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n=4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Computation&#8208;Guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>

This paper designs a substrate&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional conducting metal&#8211;organic framework with high density of active sites (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)) as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. This strategy provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites. Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics are combined to explain the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental conclusions, which provides a referable direction for further computationally guided experiments.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;Based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium&#8208;based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2&#8242;s kinetic role in MDR.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/Non&#8208;Natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To explore the combinatorial space of peptidomimetics with a broad selection of building blocks, not limited to the 20&#8197;natural amino acids, we have developed a chemical evolution process. Ancestral molecules can be generated by screening an initial library with representative building blocks. Unbiased random mutagenesis in natural evolution was replaced by the chemoinformatics&#8208;based design of iteration cycles. We can generate tens of thousands of mutations and explore an expansive combinatory space exceeding 1017, allowing the discovery of high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;generations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;natural building blocks (BBs) present a vast reservoir of chemical diversity for molecular recognition and drug discovery. However, leveraging evolutionary principles to efficiently generate bioactive molecules with a larger number of diverse BBs poses challenges within current laboratory evolution systems. Here, we introduce programmable chemical evolution (PCEvo) by integrating chemoinformatic classification and high&#8208;throughput array synthesis/screening. PCEvo initiates evolution by constructing a diversely combinatorial library to create ancestral molecules, streamlines the molecular evolution process and identifies high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;cycles. By employing PCEvo with 108 BBs and exploring &gt;1017 chemical space, we identify bicyclic peptidomimetic binders against targets SAR&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and Claudin18.2, achieving nanomolar affinity. Remarkably, Claudin18.2 binders selectively stain gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines and patient samples. PCEvo achieves expedited evolution in a few rounds, marking a significant advance in utilizing non&#8208;natural building blocks for rapid chemical evolution applicable to targets with or without prior structural information and ligand preference.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Reversible Local Protonation&#8208;Deprotonation: Tuning Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Zinc Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs). The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism, which transforms a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.







Abstract
Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparations and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device is fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of phosphonium iodide featuring blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence was reported. Benefitting from the efficient exciton utilization, near&#8208;unity PLQY, large Stokes shift, and high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability contributed by I&#8722;, the prepared phosphonium iodide delivers outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, providing the application potential in high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures. However, the weak X&#8208;ray attenuation ability and low exciton utilization efficiency result in unsatisfactory scintillation performance. Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8722;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100&#8201;%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X&#8208;ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Novel Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions in Polymer&#8208;Derived Sodium&#8208;Doped Amorphous Si&#8722;B&#8722;N Ceramic: Towards Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Activation</title>

We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass&#8208;derived electrochemical refinery.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom&#8208;cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH4 and CO2, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work provides insightful understanding for exploring more multi&#8208;molecule systems at an atomic scale.

NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.







Abstract
A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Decorated Rhodium Nanoparticles Incorporated in Covalent Organic Framework for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>

Tiny Rh nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in a covalent organic framework and then decorated with chiral diene ligands to create chiral microenvironment for asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. The results demonstrate that decorating the Rh NPs with ligands initiates activity, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the ligand and the substrate are crucial for achieving high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
While metal nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated their great potential in catalysis, introducing chiral microenvironment around metal NPs to achieve efficient conversion and high enantioselectivity remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this work, tiny Rh NPs, modified by chiral diene ligands (Lx) bearing diverse functional groups, are incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) for the asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. Though Rh NPs hosted in the COF are inactive, decorating Rh NPs with Lx creates the active Rh&#8722;Lx interface and induces high activity. Moreover, chiral microenvironment modulation around Rh NPs by altering the groups on chiral diene ligands greatly optimizes the enantioselectivity (up to 95.6&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic investigations indicate that the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between Lx and nitroalkenes plays critical roles in the resulting enantioselectivity. This work highlights the significance of chiral microenvironment modulation around metal NPs by chiral ligand decoration for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into crystalline microrods by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. CH2Cl2&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered domino transformation or patterned&#8208;mask&#8208;assisted vapor treatment transforms these microrods into multiblock polarized photonic heterojunctions with alternate yellow/red phosphorescence and orthogonal polarization directions, as a result of the vaporchromic switching of crystal packing and excited&#8208;state properties.







Abstract
Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors with different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into highly polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, the Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rods). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of the Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, the R&#8208;rod can be further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of the crystal packing and excited&#8208;state property is critical for the construction of these PPHs.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant fluorescence improvement and considerable piezochromism are firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Pressure&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancement is also observed, because of the promoted electron orbitals coupling resulting from the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.

Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a 91.5-fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure-tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure-optical relationships of ACI-type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure-suppressed nonradiative recombination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural systems optimize charge carrier behavior via molecular spatial arrangement, a phenomenon largely unexplored in artificial systems. PFC&#8208;1, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with controllable &#960;&#8208;stacking, offers valuable insights into this process. Varying &#960;&#8208;stacking perpendicular to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in HOFs alters electron density, redox potential, and charge carrier transport and separation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance.







Abstract
Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8722;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first&#8208;shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO2RR performance of C2 products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C2H4 generation, while short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C2H5OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1&#8201;%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites are accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites are beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites.

         <title>Boosting Organic Solar Cells to Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency through Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Fluorinated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>

Harnessing dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, NFREA 412&#8208;6F with halogen atoms exhibit exceptional crystallinity and improved charge transport. The D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend in OSCs shows enhanced efficiency over 18&#8201;%. 412&#8208;6F&#8242;s lower MOC compared to Y6 underscores its cost&#8208;effectiveness. This innovative approach in non&#8208;covalent forces yields a high&#8208;performance electron acceptor for superior photovoltaic outcomes.







Abstract
This study successfully designed and synthesized two nonfused ring electron acceptors, 412&#8208;6F and 412&#8208;6Cl, modified with fluorine and chlorine substituents, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that 412&#8208;6F possesses a planar molecular backbone and exhibits pronounced dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between the fluorine atoms on the lateral phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the end groups. This specific interaction promotes dense end&#8208;group stacking, leading to a reduced interlayer spacing. Improved crystallinity and coherence length are observed in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend film. Conversely, 412&#8208;6Cl adopts a more distorted configuration and lacks these interactions. As a result, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, surpassing the performance of the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6Cl OSC. This underscores the importance of designing novel acceptors with beneficial intermolecular interactions to enhance OSC efficiency, thus providing a new direction for organic photovoltaic advancement.

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>

In this study, we innovatively proposed a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition technique to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer and perovskite surface by introducing the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T). Ultimately, we successfully fabricated efficient deep&#8208;blue device delivering the stable emission at 460&#8197;nm with enhanced EQE of 5.01&#8201;% with superior half&#8208;time of 31.3&#8197;min.







Abstract
The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device performance of deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep-blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6-Tris(4-(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (P-POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet-dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep-blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrapodal hole&#8208;collecting monolayer materials based on a saddle&#8208;like cyclooctatetraene core were developed. These molecules were found to form monolayers on transparent electrode substrates, with some phosphonic acid anchoring groups pointing upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. The perovskite solar cell devices using these hole&#8208;collecting monolayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and good operational stability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a &#960;&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and 21.4&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1&#8197;cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62&#8197;cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.

         <title>Precisely Regulating Asymmetric Charge Distribution by Single&#8208;Atom Central Doped Ag&#8208;Based Series Clusters for Enhanced Photoreduction of CO2 to Alcohol Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom central doped Ag&#8208;based series clusters (M1Ag24, M=Ag, Au, Pt) were introduced to precisely regulate the charge density of FePPc, in which Pt1Ag24 caused the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe sites (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation and showing enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system.







Abstract
High efficiently photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) into liquid fuels in pure water system remains challenged. Iron polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with strong light harvesting, unique Fe&#8208;N4 structure, abundant pores, and good stability could serve as a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. To further improve the catalytic efficiency, herein, symmetry&#8208;breaking Fe sites are constructed by coupling with atomically precise M1Ag24 (M=Ag, Au, Pt) series clusters. Especially, the introduction of Pt1Ag24 causes the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe in FePPc (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation. In addition, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc exhibits the most effective photogenerated carriers transfer and separation. As a result, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc shows the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system under visible light irradiation, ~1.65/1.25&#8208;fold, 1.83/1.37&#8208;fold, and 3.60/1.61&#8208;fold higher than that of Au1Ag24&#8208;FePPc, Ag25&#8208;FePPc, and FePPc, respectively. This work provides a concept for precisely construction and regulation symmetry&#8208;breaking sites of cluster&#8208;based catalysts for effective CO2 conversion.

         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to introduce CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation sites into the framework. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport, which achieves an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%).







Abstract
The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method to synthesize highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks containing dual redox&#8208;active units. The synergistic effect of these units significantly reduces the redox energy barrier and improves the efficiency of neuromorphic computation.







Abstract
Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13&#8201;% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56&#8201;% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Size Control and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Heteroleptic Pd3A3B3 and Pd4A4B4 Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;statistical multicomponent assembly gives simple synthetic access to the first Pd3A3B3 bowls, capable of showing guest&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Adjustment of ligand angle or backbone functionality allows control over the ring size, yielding Pd4A4B4 bowls or saddle&#8208;type structures.







Abstract
Two new structural motifs within the class of heteroleptic PdnAnBn assemblies, namely syn&#8208;cis&#8208;Pd3A3B3 bowls and bowl&#8208; (syn) or saddle&#8208; (anti) shaped cis&#8208;Pd4A4B4 rings are introduced. All of the ten examples share a common longer fluorenone&#8208;based bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, equipped with meta&#8208;pyridine donor groups. The ring size (3&#8208; vs. 4&#8208;membered) and conformational preference (bowl vs. saddle) are controlled by the choice of the shorter ligand. These carry para&#8208;pyridine donors, different aromatic backbones (benzene, thiophene or selenophene) and either no or small or bulky endohedral substituents, serving to control the nuclearity of the heteroleptic rings through different effects (ligand angle, charge distribution or backbone bulk). Moreover, the luminescence of the fluorenone ligand is conserved in the formed architectures. Emission intensity as well as host&#8211;guest properties vary depending on the inward&#8208;pointing functions. All Pd3A3B3 assemblies are shown to bind chiral guest BINOL bis&#8208;sulfonate which imparts its chirality to the entire host&#8211;guest complex. This results in a guest&#8208;induced circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor glum up to 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2.&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field&#8208;assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoOxHy, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.







Abstract
The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between the recently reported organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes and previously published direct methods display that his transformation does not establish a novel concept, but simply an addition to the portfolio of known reactions. Addition of mediators to our established direct electrolysis protocol and direct conversion of reported scope examples serve further to strengthen this statement.







Abstract
The recently reported electrochemical, organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes, a reaction referred to as &#8220;electrochemical deuterium atom transfer&#8221;, differs mechanistically from reported direct electrochemical hydrogenations/deuterations only by a mediated, homogeneous SET to the substrates. By comparing direct vs. mediated processes in general and for styrene reduction, we display that Qiu's work does not change the concept of this chemistry. Experiments with mediators and the direct reduction of examples from the reported scope show that even electron&#8208;rich substrates can be reduced when our direct protocol, published six months before Qiu's work, is applied.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2024)</title>

The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <title>Cover Picture: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/Non&#8208;Natural Building Blocks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of housanes from cyclopropenes via highly strained intramolecular cyclopropanation is described. The reaction proceeds in synthetically useful yields and diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the application to the synthesis of unnatural housane&#8208;containing terpenoids is disclosed.







Abstract
The synthesis of housane derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergoes an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.

Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)2][(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 (Dy5Te6, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] (Dy6Te10), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single&#8208;molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.

These co-existing properties qualify them as the first lanthanide-based molecular magnetic semiconductors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next-generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(15-crown-5)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2-cryptand)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*Dy)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Dy&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single-molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide-based molecular magnetic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

         <title>Formation of a Decanuclear Organometallic Dysprosium Complex via a Radical&#8211;Radical Cross&#8211;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy10} complex. This ring&#8208;like {Dy10} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.







Abstract
Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complex, where all DyIII metal centres are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units (CpR = substituted cyclopentadienyl), 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of a chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid three&#8208;dimensional covalent framework (named CityU&#8208;22) were prepared, which is a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. CityU&#8208;22 shows good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat. CityU&#8208;22 also exhibits an ultraviolet nonlinear optical behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4. CityU&#8208;22 is the first chiral organic&#8211;inorganic covalent framework with a high SHG response.







Abstract
Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400&#8197;&#956;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300&#8201;&#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8722;Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;-electron-rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox-active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor-acceptor &#960;-&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution&#8208;processable non&#8208;doped device and the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution&#8208;processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film. Consequently, the non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed device with D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as the emitter achieves an ultra&#8208;high maximum EQE of 32.6&#8201;%, which remains at 26.6&#8201;% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m2. Furthermore, when using D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as a sensitizer, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7&#8201;% at a luminance of 575&#8197;cd/m2 and a full width at half maximum of 36&#8197;nm.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Ordering in A One&#8208;Dimensional Organic Copper Chloride Hybrid Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) organic metal halide hybrid, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6, has been synthesized and characterized for the first time, which exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. This work paves novel pathways for developing functional low&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids for spintronics.







Abstract
Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under&#8208;explored. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic&#8208;copper (II) chloride hybrid (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu2Cl62&#8722;]&#8734; chains, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. The two&#8208;terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 single crystal reveals its insulating nature. This work shows the potential of LD OMHHs as a highly tunable quantum material platform for spintronics.

         <title>Copper Intercalation Induces Amorphization of 2D Cu/WO3 for Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was achieved for a Cu intercalated, amorphous 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO3 is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.







Abstract
Ferromagnetism in the two&#8208;dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO3 through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO3). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO3, room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO3, which is consist of unpaired spins from W5+/W4+ with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO3, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Metastable Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes with Tunable Threading Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planetary centrifugal mixing was the key to the rapid and convenient synthesis of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs). The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction served as the end&#8208;capping reaction using glutathione (GSH) to prepare metastable PRs. The GSH stoppers prevent de&#8208;threading at room temperature, such that heating controls the de&#8208;threading rate, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyrotaxanes (CD&#8208;PRs) are gaining attention for their dynamic sliding rings along the polymer axis, enabling various applications in molecular shuttles, drug delivery, and durable polymers with slidable cross&#8208;links. However, the conventional synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs with tunable threading ratios is typically laborious, time&#8208;consuming, and complicated, which limits their scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we highlight the great potential of planetary centrifugal mixing, a process that significantly accelerates and simplifies the initial synthesis of polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs), followed by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction as an efficient end&#8208;capping reaction for the synthesis of PRs. Notably, PRs synthesized with glutathione (GSH) as the end&#8208;capping reagent are in a metastable state, where GSH act as a molecular bumper that significantly prevent de&#8208;threading of &#945;&#8208;CD rings at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of ring de&#8208;threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework based on perylene diimide (PDI&#8208;PDA) has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic efficiency in thioether oxidation to sulfoxide compounds was more than ten&#8208;fold higher than that of PDI&#8208;PH. The enhanced electron&#8208;induced O2 activation under visible light was due to improved charge separation and transfer.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron&#8208;transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving the charge&#8208;separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy was utilized to rapidly prepare electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films at room temperature, which exhibited stable polymorphic electrochromic properties. Additionally, the electrochromic behavior of COFs films at negative potentials can be regulated by uranium, demonstrating the unique color tunability of COFs.







Abstract
A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic color variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.

         <title>Methoxide&#8208;Enabled Zirconium&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes is presented that allows the direct use of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst through mild activation with a methoxide additive. The reaction can be applied to terminal, internal, and conjugated alkenes. A catalytic zirconium walk ensures the selective formation of linear silane products. Based on additional experiments and calculations, a zirconium(IV) mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber's Nightmare&#8221;&#8212;A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A most common cubic phase in lyotropic (surfactant&#8208;water) systems, the &#8220;plumber's nightmare&#8221; labyrinth, has never been found in thermotropic liquid crystals. Here the first example is reported. Intriguingly, removal of just a methyl branch from the fluorescent mesogen's six alkyls converts the double&#8208;network cubic into an array of counter&#8208;twisting helices.







Abstract
Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.

While the first two are also present in solvent-free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six-fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod-like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side-branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side-chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod-like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end-chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework-forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry-based explanation is given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones as well as &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process.

The mild reaction conditions allow use of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes bearing a variety of functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process, in which a cationic acylcobalt(IV) complex is proposed as the key intermediate.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in a Photostable Ion&#8208;Paired Yb&#8722;Eu Heteronuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion emission of Eu3+ was achieved in a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] and the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified. In addition, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 of 420&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes have potential application in diverse fields and attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the similar coordination reactivity of lanthanide ions has constrained the designability of target molecule with well&#8208;defined structure, and many attempts obtained statistical mixtures. Herein, an ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] (TpPy=tris[3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl]hydroborate, ND=3&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;4&#8208;olate) was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07&#8197;&#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98&#8197;&#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95&#8201;% of the initial emission intensity) of 420&#8197;minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Locking and Sulfur&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Constructing Deep&#8208;Red Organic Electroluminescent Emitter with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, the lack of construction strategies for purely red MR&#8208;TADF materials significantly impedes their application in full&#8208;color high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking and sulfur&#8208;embedding strategy to modify the parent MR&#8208;TADF framework, resulting in a red MR&#8208;TADF emitter with high color purity. The reported MR&#8208;TADF molecule (namely, FSBN) demonstrates a pure red emission with an emission maximum of 621 nm in toluene solution. The OLED with FSBN as emitter exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), which exactly matches the red standard defined by the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC). Importantly, the single&#8208;host OLED achieves a high power efficiency (PE) of up to 50.1 lm W&#8722;1, suggesting the potential for the development of low power consumption red OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hypothesis on the Function of High&#8208;Valent Fe in NiFe (Hydr)oxide in the Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in&#8208;situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96 hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Pentacoordinate Halogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar hypercoordinate motifs represent an intriguing frontier in chemistry, challenging traditional bonding norms. As electronegativity of the central atom increases, achieving planar hypercoordination becomes more difficult due to restricted delocalization, making the design of planar hypercoordinate halogens particularly puzzling. Here, we conduct an extensive computational survey of LinXn+1&#8211; (n = 4, 5, 6; X = F, Cl, Br, I) clusters, revealing a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum in Li5X6&#8211; (X = F, Cl, Br) with a planar pentacoordinate halogen (ppX), where X&#8211; is located at the center of Li5X5 crown. The clusters are stabilized predominantly through electrostatic interactions between X&#8211; and Li5X5, complemented by weak covalent bonding from dative interaction. Due to the weak orbital overlap, ppX clusters exhibit localized diatropic ring currents around X and Li.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Confinement&#8208;Induced Excited Charge Transfer in Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Promoting CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allows for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C and 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35 &#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200 h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52 mAh cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6% capacity retention after 70000 cycles (7 months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;30 to 50 &#176;C) and fast charging ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Photoinduced&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Probe with a Turn&#8208;ON Chemiluminescence Mode&#8208;of&#8208;Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PeT&#8208;based fluorescent probes were demonstrated to be powerful tools for detection and imaging, owing to their significant fluorescence enhancement in response to specific targets. While numerous examples of fluorescence&#8208;based PeT have been frequently reported, there is not even a single example of a PeT probe that operates via a chemiluminescence mode. Here we report the first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe that acts via a chemiluminescent operation mode. We designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel chemiluminescent probe, featuring a PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on mechanism. The probe consists of a phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane, linked to an azide unit that acts as a PeT quencher. Upon cycloaddition of a strained cycloalkyne with the azide, a triazole&#8208;dioxetane is formed, which undergoes relatively slow chemiexcitation, resulting in a measurement window with an exceptionally high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (over 5000&#8208;fold). The PeT&#8208;dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc&#8208;DBCO and Max&#8208;DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT&#8208;based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT&#8208;quenching pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Lysosomal Thiols for Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number and stability of lysosomes (LYs) are different in cancer and healthy cells that makes them a possible target for cancer specific therapy. However, no LY&#8208;targeting drug is clinically approved yet. We describe in this paper a new therapeutic approach based on alkylation of lysosomal thiols in cancer cells by reversible thiol binder 11. The treatment with 11 increases the level of lysosomal reactive oxygen species leading to their destabilization, disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. These effects are not observed in healthy cells. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner (NK)/Ly&#8208;RB model, 11 exhibits the spectacular therapeutic effect: it extends the lifespan of the treated mice from 21 to 85 days and cures 40% of mice. The survived mice develop antibodies against tumor NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells. Their repeated challenge with the NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells results in 100% mice survival compared to 0% survival in the control group of na&#239;ve mice. Ex vivo data indicate that neutrophils in spleen of the cured animals are also involved in targeting cancer cells and produce neutrophil extracellular traps. In summary, 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil&#8217;s reaction against tumors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click&#8208;release chemistry is a cutting&#8208;edge tool for exploring&#160;and manipulating&#160; biomolecule functions&#160;in native biological systems. However, it is challenging to achieve the precise regulation or therapy of individual cells via click&#8208;release strategies driven by proximity and thermodynamics. Herein, we propose a novel photoclick&#8208;release approach based on a photo&#8208;induced cycloaddition between 4,4'&#8208;bis(N&#8208;arylsydnone) or&#160;C&#8208;bithienyl&#8208;diarylsydnone and 2&#8208;arylamino&#8208;naphthoquinone via irradiation with&#160;405 or 485 nm light. It&#160;constructs 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[f]indazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione (BIZON) as a pharmacophore while releases an arylamine for fluorescence turn&#8208;on probing. Both of the photoclick reagents were tailored by&#160;connecting to the triphenyl phosphonium&#160;delivery&#160;motif for enrichment in the mitochondria of live cells.&#160;This enables&#160;an intracellular photoclick and release under the control of 405 or 485 nm light. We then discovered that the in situ photo&#8208;generated BIZON is capable of photosensitizing upon 485 or 520 nm light to produce singlet oxygen inside the mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Therefore, we&#160;realized wash&#8208;free fluorescence tracking and subsequent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at single&#8208;cell resolution by using global illumination, which provides a foundation for wavelength&#8208;gated single&#8208;cell theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenating Polyethylene Terephthalate into Degradable Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling and upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester plastic globally, has attracted growing attention concerning its disposal as non&#8208;degradable waste in the natural environment. Transforming end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET into (bio)degradable polyester offers a novel approach to managing its waste. In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt; 87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. Pronounced depolymerization would occur with deeper hydrogenation, which generates a blend of PET&#8208;PECHD and polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) with lower Mw, and finally a single&#8208;type polymer PECHD. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and (bio)degradability in acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil. This research highlights the potential for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production of degradable polyester from real&#8208;life plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Suppression of Multilayer Ion Migration via Molecular Complexation Strategy toward High&#8208;Performance Regular Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The migration and diffusion of Li+, I&#8208; and Ag impedes the realization of long&#8208;term operationally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a multifunctional and universal molecular complexation strategy to simultaneously stabilize hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite layer and Ag electrode by the suppression of Li+, I&#8208; and Ag migration via directly incorporating bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO) into HTL. Meanwhile, TCPO co&#8208;doping results in enhanced hole mobility of HTL, advantageous energy band alignment and mitigated interfacial defects, thereby leading to facilitated hole extraction and minimized nonradiative recombination losses. TCPO&#8208;doped regular device achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.68% (certified 25.59%). The unencapsulated TCPO doped devices maintain over 90% of their initial efficiencies after 730 h of continuous operation under one sun illumination, 2800 h of storage at 30% relative humidity, and 1200 h of exposure to 65 &#176;C, which represents one of the best stabilities reported for regular PSCs. This work provides a new approach to enhance the PCE and long&#8208;term stability of PSCs by host&#8208;guest complexation strategy via rational design of multifunctional ligand molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvation via Ion Dipole Interactions for Low&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extending the stability of ether solvents is pivotal for developing low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4&#8208;, PF6&#8208; and di&#64258;uoro(oxalato)borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in&#8208;situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether&#8208;Li+&#8208;anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high&#8208;voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent&#8208;deficient electric double layer and an anti&#8208;oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0 C and high capacity retention of 93.12% after 200 cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99% at both 25 and &#8208;30 &#176;C.</dc:description>

Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4-, PF6- and di&#64258;uoro(oxalato)borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in-situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether-Li+-anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high-voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent-deficient electric double layer and an anti-oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0 C and high capacity retention of 93.12% after 200 cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99% at both 25 and -30 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high Li+ conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700 cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40 V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>LAMP&#8208;MS for Locus&#8208;Specific Visual Quantification of DNA 5mC and RNA m6A Using Ultra&#8208;Low Input</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the effectiveness of utilizing circulating cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) for disease screening remains a challenge, necessitating improved sensitivity, specificity, cost&#8208;efficiency, and patient adherence. We present here LAMP&#8208;MS, an innovative technology that integrates linear amplification with single&#8208;base quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry on silicon chips. This approach overcomes several limitations in utilizing cfDNA 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) status for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. LAMP&#8208;MS enables unbiased amplification of as little as 1 ng of cfDNA, site&#8208;specifically quantify methylation levels of tens to hundreds of 5mC sites, thereby facilitating cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution quantitative detection of cfDNA methylation markers. We have validated the accuracy of DNA methylation determination using DNA probes and cfDNA from patient plasma samples, confirmed by mass spectrometric peak areas. Additionally, we have further shown this Mass Array technology could be expanded to also quantify RNA m6A modification sites. Combining the ability to work with ultra&#8208;low input materials and a visually interpretable output, LAMP&#8208;MS stands out as a promising method for real&#8208;world applications in clinics and laboratories for nucleic acid methylation detection and quantification.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic carbonyl compounds have been recognized as promising electrodes due to multiple active sites, abundant element resources and flexible structural designability, while their practical applications are still hindered by the easy solubility and low discharge potential. Herein, a novel bipolar polymer composite (TAC) was well&#8208;designed by grafting p&#8208;type triphenylamine units onto n&#8208;type anthraquinone to form an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and in&#8208;situ growing on carbon nanotubes, which was proved not only with higher discharge potential but also effectively suppress the dissolution issues. Moreover, TAC combined the advantages of different active sites and behaved a dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. Benefitting from the in&#8208;situ polymerization process, TAC with tube&#8208;type core&#8208;shell structure exhibited enhanced electron transport and improved utilization of active sites, resulting in high capacity (193 mAh g&#8208;1), outstanding rate performance (fast charging within 17 s), long&#8208;term stability (a high capacity retention of 87% after 1000 cycles) and high mass loading (10 mg cm&#8208;2). Additionally, TAC can well adapt to the temperature change, outputting a capacity of 72 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;60 &#176;C and&#160;165 mAh g&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C. Such versatile polymer structure inspires the design of high performance organic materials for rechargeable batteries to satisfy high stability and wide temperature operations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Gaseous Alkanes with (Hetero)Aryl Bromides via Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic methodology for the direct cross&#8208;coupling of gaseous alkanes with (hetero)aryl bromides through the combination of metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis is reported. The method provides an efficient platform for the conversion of these abundant chemical feedstocks into high&#8208;value alkyl(hetero)arenes and bypasses the longstanding need of using preactivated alkylating agents in C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Gaseous alkanes represent the most abundant carbon&#8208;based chemical feedstocks in our planet. However, the intrinsic inertness of their C&#8722;H bonds has rendered the use of these alkanes very difficult for purposes beyond aerobic combustion and energy intensive processes. Thus, clean and energy&#8208;efficient transformations for their use in synthetic organic chemistry are still rare. Here we report a catalytic methodology for the direct cross&#8208;coupling of gaseous alkanes with (hetero)aryl bromides through the combination of metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This protocol provides an efficient platform for the addition of short alkyl groups into diverse (hetero) aromatic rings, providing a wide range of high&#8208;value alkyl(hetero)arenes, and bypassing the longstanding need of using preactivated alkylating agents in C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings. The method features high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and a remarkable functional group tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and exhibits operational simplicity

A broad range of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes with noteworthy optical properties (&#934;F up to 0.94) have been constructed in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (72 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.

         <title>Fighting Mutations with Mutations: Evolutionarily Adapting a DNA Aptamer for High&#8208;Affinity Recognition of Mutated Spike Proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBA5SA1, a new DNA aptamer with picomolar affinity to the spike protein of diverse Omicron subvariants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, is derived by in vitro selection for the recognition of the spike protein of BA.5 from a mutational library built on the scaffold of MSA52, an aptamer originally developed to recognize the spike protein of the wild&#8208;type virus. MBA5SA1&#8217;s affinity to the Omicron spike protein is &gt;100&#8208;fold higher than MSA52 and has set up a more reliable and sensitive clinical diagnostic tool for the Omicron variants.







Abstract
An on&#8208;going challenge with COVID&#8208;19, which has huge implications for future pandemics, is the rapid emergence of viral variants that makes diagnostic tools less accurate, calling for rapid identification of recognition elements for detecting new variants caused by mutations. We hypothesize that we can fight mutations of the viruses with mutations of existing recognition elements. We demonstrate this concept via rapidly evolving an existing DNA aptamer originally selected for the spike protein (S&#8208;protein) of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to enhance the interaction with the same protein of the Omicron variants. The new aptamer, MBA5SA1, has acquired 22 mutations within its 40&#8208;nucleotide core sequence and improved its binding affinity for the S&#8208;proteins of diverse Omicron subvariants by &gt;100&#8208;fold compared to its parental aptamer (improved from nanomolar to picomolar affinity). Deep sequencing analysis reveals dynamic competitions among several MBA5SA1 variants in response to increasing selection pressure imposed during in vitro selection, with MBA5SA1 being the final winner of the competition. Additionally, MBA5SA1 was implemented into an enzyme&#8208;linked aptamer binding assay (ELABA), which was applied for detecting Omicron variants in the saliva of infected patients. The assay produced a sensitivity of 86.5&#8201;% and a specificity of 100&#8201;%, which were established with 83 clinical samples.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;switching strategy for in situ formulating stationary or removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in ESE&#8208;NiOOH is developed with ultrahigh selectivity for electrocatalytic upgrading of aromatic secondary alcohols via direct dehydrogenation to acetophenones or C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage to benzoic acids. Precisely modulating lattice&#8208;oxygen removability is reported for the first time to activate C&#8722;H and vector downstream reactions.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99&#8201;%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH's intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8722; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94&#8201;% yield. This in situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.

         <title>Extending Shelf&#8208;Life of Two&#8208;Step Method Precursor Solutions through Targeted Regulation for Highly Efficient and Reproducible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The commercialization of PVSCs is hindered by poor reproducibility due to the chemical instability of the solution&#8208;processed materials. We first observe that the aging phenomenon is more pronounced in the precursor solution of the two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in the one&#8208;step method due to the difference in the used solvents. Here, an effective targeted strategy for precursor stabilization by introducing benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol (BDT) and decamethylferrocene (FcMe10) additives into the organic amine salt solution and the PbI2 precursor solution, thus extending the shelf&#8208;life of the two&#8208;step precursor solutions.







Abstract
Precursor solution aging process can cause significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Notably, we first observe that the aging phenomenon is more severe in the precursor of two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in one&#8208;step method due to that the protic solvent isopropanol facilitates amine&#8208;cation side reaction and iodide ions oxidation. Herein, we report a novel approach for selectively stabilizing both organic amine salt and lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solutions in two&#8208;step method. The introduction of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol into organic amine salt solution can mitigate amine&#8208;cation side reactions due to the formation of an acidic and reducing environment. Simultaneously, decamethylferrocene (FcMe10/FcMe+10) pair can act as a redox shuttle in PbI2 solution to concurrently oxidize Pb0 and reduce I2 in cyclic manner. Consequently, the PVSCs device fabricated from ameliorative precursor solutions demonstrates superior power conversion efficiency of 25.31&#8201;%, retaining 95&#8201;% of its efficiency after 21&#8197;days of solution aging. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency for 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination. This work establishes a fundamental guidance and scientific direction for the stabilization of two&#8208;step perovskite precursor solutions.

         <title>Revealing and Inhibiting the Facet&#8208;related Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal the unknown relation between ion migration and crystal facet, in which the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to occur cationic migration than the (111) facet, and then control the (111)&#8208;orientation through an antisolvent strategy. The PSCs with (111)&#8208;dominated perovskite achieve a PCE of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification), and can maintain &gt;95&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 3500&#8208;hours operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Ion migration is a major issue hindering the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As an intrinsic characteristic of metal halide perovskite materials, ion migration is closely related to the atomic arrangement and coordination, which are the basic characteristic differences among various facets. Herein, we report the facet&#8208;related ion migration, and then achieve the inhibition of ion migration in perovskite through finely modulating the facet orientation. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to cationic migration than the (111) facet. The main reason for this difference in migration is that the cationic migration route in the (111) facet deviates from that in the (100) facet, which increases the active migration energy and weakens the contribution from the electric field during operation. We prepare a (111)&#8208;dominated perovskite film by incorporating a facile and green addition of water (H2O) into the antisolvent, further achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification) on regular planar PSCs and 25.8&#8201;% on inverted PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3500&#8208;hours operation under simulated AM1.5 illumination at the maximum power point.

     alt="Revealing and Inhibiting the Facet-related Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first reveal the unknown relation between ion migration and crystal facet, in which the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to occur cationic migration than the (111) facet, and then control the (111)-orientation through an antisolvent strategy. The PSCs with (111)-dominated perovskite achieve a PCE of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification), and can maintain &amp;gt;95&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 3500-hours operation under 1-sun illumination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion migration is a major issue hindering the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As an intrinsic characteristic of metal halide perovskite materials, ion migration is closely related to the atomic arrangement and coordination, which are the basic characteristic differences among various facets. Herein, we report the facet-related ion migration, and then achieve the inhibition of ion migration in perovskite through finely modulating the facet orientation. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to cationic migration than the (111) facet. The main reason for this difference in migration is that the cationic migration route in the (111) facet deviates from that in the (100) facet, which increases the active migration energy and weakens the contribution from the electric field during operation. We prepare a (111)-dominated perovskite film by incorporating a facile and green addition of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into the antisolvent, further achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification) on regular planar PSCs and 25.8&#8201;% on inverted PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3500-hours operation under simulated AM1.5 illumination at the maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Acidity Chloride Electrolyte Enables Exceptional Reversibility and Stability in Aqueous Tin Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a low&#8208;acidity tin chloride electrolyte (pH~1.09) for aqueous tin metal batteries, which leads to superior plating efficiency (99.23&#8211;99.97&#8201;%) and long cyling stability (~3000&#8197;hours) across various harsh conditions.







Abstract
Tin (Sn) metal has emerged as a promising anode for aqueous batteries, due to its high capacity, non&#8208;toxicity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, Sn metal has often been coupled with strong and corrosive sulfuric acids (2&#8211;3&#8197;M), leading to severe electrode corrosion and hydrogen evolution issues. Although high efficiency and long cycling were reported, the results were achieved using high currents to kinetically mask electrode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions. Herein, we introduce a low&#8208;acidity tin chloride electrolyte (pH=1.09) as a more viable option, which eliminates the need of strong acids and enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;free Sn plating chemistry. Remarkably, the plating efficiency approaches unity (99.97&#8201;%) under standard testing conditions (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), which maintains high at 99.23&#8211;99.93&#8201;% across various aggressive conditions, including low current (0.1&#8211;0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), high capacity (5&#8211;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and extended resting time (24&#8211;72&#8197;hours). The battery calendar life is further prolonged to 3064&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing literature reports. Additionally, we presented an effective method to mitigate the potential Sn2+ oxidization issue on the cathode, demonstrating long&#8208;cycling Sn||LiMn2O4 hybrid batteries. This work offers critical insights for developing highly reversible Sn metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Battery with Innovative Anolyte based on Steric Hindrance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries retain stability exceeding 1831&#8197;cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding an energy efficiency of ~80&#8201;% and maintains a steady discharge capacity.







Abstract
All&#8208;soluble all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries (AIRFBs) are an innovative energy storage technology that offer significant financial benefits. Stable and affordable redox&#8208;active materials are essential for the commercialization of AIRFBs, yet the battery stability must be significantly improved to achieve practical value. Herein, ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. The coordination structure and failure mechanism of our Fe&#8208;TIPA complexes were determined by molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic experiments. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFBs retained excellent stability exceeding 1831&#8197;cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding an energy efficiency of ~80&#8201;% and maintaining a steady discharge capacity. Moreover, the all&#8208;soluble electrolyte was tested in an industrial&#8208;scale Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFB prototype energy storage system, where an energy efficiency of 81.3&#8201;% was attained. Given the abundance of iron resources, we model the TIPA AIRFB electrolyte cost to be as low as 32.37&#8197;$/kWh, which is significantly cheaper than the current commercial level. This work demonstrates that steric hindrance is an effective measure to extended battery life, facilitating the commercial development of affordable flow batteries.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Switching of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Norbornadienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient energy storage system using underexplored sensitization strategies has been developed. Quantitative conversion and maximum isomerization quantum yields of aryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes to the stable quadricyclane counterpart with exceptional energy storage capabilities are achieved, while harvesting photons from the solar spectrum efficiently.







Abstract
Norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches have emerged as promising candidates for harnessing and storing solar energy, holding great promise as a viable solution to meet the growing energy demands. Despite their potential, the effectiveness of their direct photochemical conversion into the resulting quadricyclanes has room for improvement owing to (i) moderate quantum yields, (ii) poor overlap with the solar spectrum and (iii) photochemical back reactions. Herein, we present an approach to enhance the performance of such molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems through the triplet&#8208;sensitized conversion of aryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes. Our study combines deep spectroscopic analyses, irradiation experiments, and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the energy transfer mechanism and inherent advantages of the resulting MOST systems. We demonstrate remarkable quantum yields using readily available sensitizers under both LED and solar light irradiation, significantly surpassing those achieved through direct excitation with photons of higher energy. In contrast to the conventional approach, light&#8208;induced back reactions of the high&#8208;energy products do not play any role, allowing quantitative switching within minutes. These results not only underscore the potential of triplet&#8208;sensitized MOST systems to leverage the high energy storage capabilities of multistate photoswitches but they might also stimulate the broader usage of sensitization strategies in photochemical energy conversion.

         <title>Non&#8208;Natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non&#8208;natural glycopeptide antigen with a site&#8208;specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.







Abstract
Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non&#8208;natural amino acids and has an &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross&#8208;Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re&#8208;bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1&#8208;like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site&#8208;specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.

&lt;p&gt;Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin-1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor-associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non-selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1-based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure-guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non-natural amino acids and has an &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt; (Cross-Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re-bridging of a disulfide in CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt;, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1-like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor-associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch-to-batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site-specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;efficient domino strategy maximizing the yield of non&#8208;phenolic dealkylated aromatics from the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif by one&#8208;pot catalytic cascade, consisting of selective dehydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;carbinol group, retro&#8208;aldol to cleave C&#8722;C bonds, and decarbonylation of the generated aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, a subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction that cleaves the C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond, followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75&#8201;% selectivity for 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers, alongside syngas (CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2&#8776;1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through an enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.

         <title>Simultaneous Cycloadditions in the Solid State via Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous [4+4] and [2+2] cycloadditions are achieved within a single crystalline solid for the first time. The cycloadditions occur with complete control over regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and in high yield, whereas simultaneous solution reactions afford a mixture of isomers. Reaction reversibility and application to solar thermal storage materials is also discussed.







Abstract
Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline&#8208;state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self&#8208;assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline&#8208;phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self&#8208;assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well&#8208;controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution&#8208;state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually&#8208;reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.

         <title>Assembly Regulates Gamma Radiation Polymerization of Polytelluoxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetic&#8208;based strategy for regulating responsiveness of gamma radiation&#8208;induced chemical reaction was developed. The strategy was realized in the polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO) through the construction of different assembly microenvironment. The assembly also kept changing with radiation and make it a milder method to prepare such polymer.







Abstract
Regulating chemical drug's responsiveness to gamma radiation is crucial for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. Most research focused on thermodynamic chemical structure design, while little attention was paid to kinetic regulate strategy, which possesses greater universality and security. In this study, we achieved a kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy of gamma radiation reaction, through the construction of microphase environment during polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO). We designed hydrophobic segments forming large compound micelles (LCMs) assembly to create kinetically favorable higher concentration for radiation&#8208;induced reaction. It exhibited a &gt; ten times higher responsiveness and, as far as we know, merely required a minimum dosage of 5 Gy for polymerization to occur. What's more, by taking advantages of the assembly change with Te&#8722;O hydrophilic segments and gamma radiation, polymerization became milder with lower polydispersity than previous methods. Such kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy could offer a novel perspective on the design of radiation&#8208;responsive chemoradiotherapy and other radiation&#8208;induced chemical process.

         <title>Concise and Modular Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Bisbenzylisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bisBIAs) were synthesized in five to seven steps through a chemoenzymatic approach. An enzymatic Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction followed by selective enzymatic methylation or chemical functionalizations enabled the scalable synthesis of BIA monomers. Subsequent modular assembly was achieved by a modified Ullmann coupling or oxidative coupling, with macrocyclization through intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction or Ullmann coupling.







Abstract
The bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bisBIAs) have attracted tremendous attention from the synthetic community due to their diverse and intriguing biological activities. Herein, we report the convergent and modular chemoenzymatic syntheses of eight bisBIAs bearing various substitutes and linkages in 5&#8211;7 steps. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various well&#8208;designed enantiopure benzylisoquinoline monomers was accomplished through an enzymatic stereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, followed by regioselective enzymatic methylation or chemical functionalization in a sequential one&#8208;pot process. A modified intermolecular copper&#8208;mediated Ullmann coupling enabled the concise and efficient total synthesis of five different linear bisBIAs with either head&#8208;to&#8208;tail or tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail linkage. A biomimetic oxidative phenol dimerization selectively formed the sterically hindered, electron&#8208;rich diaryl ether bond, and subsequent intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura domino reaction or Ullmann coupling facilitated the first enantioselective total synthesis of three macrocyclic bisBIAs, including ent&#8208;isogranjine, tetrandrine and O&#8208;methylrepandine. This study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in the total synthesis of diverse bisBIAs and paves the way to further explore the biological functions of these natural products.

         <title>Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Inhibiting Catalyst Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni catalyst readily react with S8 to form NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slows down kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Conversely, Ni&#8722;N coordination catalyst, usually as Ni&#8722;N4, offers effective passivation resistance and rapid LiPSs conversion kinetics. Preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various transition metals and coordination numbers of N.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries exhibit great potential as the next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. Application of catalyst is widely adopted to accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions and improve battery performance. Although significant attention has been devoted to seeking new catalysts, the problem of catalyst passivation remains underexplored.

The Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits excellent resistance to passivation and rapid kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits a high rate capability of 604.11&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;C and maintains a low capacity decay rate of 0.046&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. Furthermore, preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various coordination numbers and transition metals. This study reveals a new aspect of metal&#8208;N coordination in inhibiting catalyst passivation, improving our understanding of catalysts in Li&#8722;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Ni catalyst readily react with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to form NiS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slows down kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Conversely, Ni&#8722;N coordination catalyst, usually as Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, offers effective passivation resistance and rapid LiPSs conversion kinetics. Preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; but also to various transition metals and coordination numbers of N.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Asymmetric Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling has been successfully developed, not only enabling the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriching the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Oxindolyl&#8208;Based Radicals with Tunable Mechanochromic and Thermochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four oxindolyl&#8208;based monoradicals (OxRs) with different substituents were synthesized and characterized. These OxRs can associate and dissociate reversibly in response to soft external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, and solvent polarity. Notably, the bond dissociation energies of OxR dimers can be finely tuned by the captodative effect between the radical sites and the attached substituents.







Abstract
Organic radicals based dynamic covalent chemistry is promising in preparing stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials, due to their simplicity of dissociation/association, accompanied with distinct color changes during the process. However, suitable organic radicals for dynamic covalent chemistry have not been widely explored yet. Herein, a series of oxindolyl&#8208;based mono&#8208;radicals (OxRs) with different substituents were successfully synthesized and studied systematically as potential building blocks for stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials. These OxRs would dimerize spontaneously to form their corresponding dimers. The structures of dimers were unambiguously confirmed through low&#8208;temperature 1H&#8197;NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Dynamic interconversion between monomers and dimers was achieved by reversible cleavage and recovery of the &#963;&#8208;bond upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure, and solvent polarity), accompanied by significant color changes. It is interesting that the stability of the mono&#8208;radical could be tuned through changing different substituents, and consequently altering the bond dissociation energy of the dynamic covalent bond between monomers. These new OxRs characterized by appreciable properties are entitled to more opportunities in developing mechanochromic and thermochromic materials, where their responsiveness to stimuli can be readily controlled by the substituents adhered.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of Helicene Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters in Molecular Solids and Bright Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic molecular chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence) of helicences are perfectly transferred from solution to the crystal state and to water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by encapsulating the chiral emitter in supramolecular small&#8208;molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). Furthermore, CPL brightness is enhanced by combination with a rhodamine antenna system.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from chiral molecules is attracting much attention due to its potential use in optical materials. However, formulation of CPL emitters as molecular solids typically deteriorates photophysical properties in the aggregated state leading to quenching and unpredictable changes in CPL behavior impeding materials development. To circumvent these shortcomings, a supramolecular approach can be used to isolate cationic dyes in a lattice of cyanostar&#8208;anion complexes that suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and which we hypothesize can preserve the synthetically&#8208;crafted chiroptical properties. Herein, we verify that supramolecular assembly of small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) allows translation of molecular ECD and CPL properties to solids. A series of cationic helicenes that display increasing chiroptical response is investigated. Crystal structures of three different packing motifs all show spatial isolation of dyes by the anion complexes. We observe the photophysical and chiroptical properties of all helicenes are seamlessly translated to water soluble nanoparticles by the SMILES method. Also, a DMQA helicene is used as FRET acceptor in SMILES nanoparticles of intensely absorbing rhodamine antennae to generate an 18&#8208;fold boost in CPL brightness. These features offer promise for reliably accessing bright materials with programmable CPL properties.

         <title>Effective Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with an Iron&#8208;Xantphos Catalyst: Mechanistic and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction, and reactivity studies are utilized to identify the key organoiron intermediates and reaction pathways, including ligand effects on iron speciation, that enable effective iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
While iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings have been widely studied and developed in the last decade, alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling systems with iron remain underdeveloped despite the importance of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in organic synthesis. A major challenge to the development of these reactions is the current lack of fundamental insight into ligand effects and organoiron intermediates that enable effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl couplings. The current study addresses this longstanding limitation using a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and reactivity studies of alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling with iron&#8208;Xantphos to define the in situ formed iron&#8208;Xantphos intermediates in catalysis. Combined with detailed reactivity studies, the nature of the key mechanistic pathways in catalysis and ligands effects to achieve effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling over competing &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathways are probed. Overall, these foundational studies provide a platform for future bespoke ligand and pre&#8208;catalyst design for alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling methods development with sustainable iron catalysis.

         <title>A Tandem Catalysis for Isoindolinone Synthesis over Single&#8208;Atom Pd/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel tandem catalysis for synthesizing the isoindolinone (IIO) over a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst. The TiO2 efficiently converts phthalic anhydride (PA) with ammonia and the spillover hydrogen species activated over single&#8208;atom Pd to form IIO. Notably, NH3 serves as not only a reactant but also could accelerate the reduction of amide intermediate through the formation of a key intermediate 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one (NH2&#8208;IIO).







Abstract
Developing an efficient strategy to replace the conventional synthesis method for producing isoindolinone (IIO) scaffold, a crucial structural motif for constructing pharmaceutical molecules, remains to be a great challenge. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 tandem catalysis has been developed for the IIO scaffold synthesis by using readily available phthalic anhydride (PA), ammonia, and H2. The single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving a PA conversion of 99&#8201;%, an IIO selectivity of 91&#8201;%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4807&#8197;h&#8722;1. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the tandem catalysis between TiO2 support and single&#8208;atom Pd. The TiO2 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of PA with ammonia to form phthalimide (PAM), subsequently transformed into IIO over TiO2 through the reaction of PAM with NH3 and the spillover hydrogen species derived from single&#8208;atom Pd. Notably, NH3 functions not only as a reactant but also as a promoter to accelerate the reduction of amides combined with the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This tandem catalysis of a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of the crucial IIO platform molecules.

         <title>A Helicene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Inductor and Capacitor with Frequency&#8208;Dependent Charge&#8208;Transport Pathways</title>

Investigation of charge transport behaviors in Helicene&#8208;based molecular wires under alternating currents of varying frequencies.







Abstract
Despite extensive studies has been explored on single&#8208;molecule switches and rectifiers, the design of single&#8208;molecule inductors has not been explored due to the experimental challenges in the investigation of frequency&#8208;dependent charge transport at the single&#8208;molecule scale. In this study, we synthesized a helicene&#8208;based helical molecular wire and carried out meticulous single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, combined with current&#8211;voltage (IV) studies with varying frequencies using the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Our results reveal the formation of a single&#8208;molecule junction and highlight the unique behavior of the molecular wire in response to different alternating current (AC) varying frequencies. The transport of charges occurs selectively either through the coiled backbone of the conjugated helical structure or vertically via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, depending on the frequency of the applied AC. Notably, our investigation demonstrates the functionality of the wire as an inductor at low frequencies, and a capacitor at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for a systematic approach to designing, fabricating, and implementing single&#8208;molecule logic devices such as inductors and wave filters.

         <title>Synergistic Tuning of Microstructure and Morphology in Carbon Molecular Sieve Hollow Fibers for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure in the dense &#8220;skin&#8221; and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers derived from 6FDA&#8201;:&#8201;BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors via a pre&#8208;pyrolysis sub&#8208;Tg thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables significantly increased propylene permeance while maintaining adequate propylene/propane selectivity.







Abstract
Asymmetric carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes with tunable micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structural morphologies for energy efficient propylene&#8208;propane separation are reported here. A sub&#8208;glass transition temperature (sub&#8208;Tg) thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables simultaneous optimization of the intrinsic molecular sieving properties while also reducing the thickness of the CMS &#8220;skin&#8221; derived from the 6FDA&#8201;:&#8201;BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors. Such synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers enables significantly increased propylene permeance (reaching 186.5&#8197;GPU) while maintaining an appealing propylene/propane selectivity of 13.3 for 50/50 propylene/propane mixed gas feeds. Our findings reveal a more refined and versatile tool than available with previous O2&#8208;doping pretreatments. The advanced approach here should be broadly useful to other polyimide precursors and diverse gas pairs.

         <title>Nonconventional Fluorescent Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams for Multipurpose Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isocyanate&#8208;free polyurethane foams prepared by the facile, upscalable water&#8208;induced self&#8208;foaming technology present a nonconventional fluorescent behaviour with a multicolor emission. This clusteroluminescence is exploited for sensing and quantifying gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+) and antibiotics.







Abstract
Fluorescent foams with interconnected pores are attractive for the detection and quantification of various products. However, many fluorescent probes are suffering from aggregation&#8208;caused fluorescence quenching in their solid/aggregated state, are costly, and/or not straightforward to incorporate in foams, limiting their utility for this application. Herein, non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams, prepared by the simple water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blowing process, present a nonconventional fluorescence behaviour, i.e. they are intrinsically fluorescent with a multicolor emission without requiring ex situ traditional fluorescent probes. These foams demonstrate utility for capturing&#8208;sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+). They are also able to selectively sense tetracycline antibiotic in a ratiometric way with a high sensitivity. By exploiting the unique multicolor photoluminescent foam properties, a smartphone&#8208;compatible device is used for the facile antibiotic quantification. This nonconventional fluorescence behaviour is discussed experimentally and theoretically, and is mainly based on clusteroluminescence originating from multiple hydrogen bonding and hetero&#8208;atomic sub&#8208;luminophores, thus from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens that are naturally present in the foams. This work illustrates that easily accessible non&#8208;conventional fluorescent NIPU foams characterized by a modular emission wavelength have an enormous potential for multiple substrates detection and quantification.

         <title>Stable Dendrite&#8208;Free Room Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Novel Sodium Thiotellurate Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this rational design, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C under practically necessary conditions, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries is severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfides shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3 interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid&#8208;electrolyte Na2TeS3 interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na2TeS3 interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid-electrolyte Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite-free Na-metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode-free cell fabricated with the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, which could pave a new path to design high-performance cathodes for anode-free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying the Hydration&#8208;Dependent Dynamics of Cu Migration and Activity in Zeolite Omega for the Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega's (Cu&#8208;omega) activity in partial methane oxidation via oxygen looping significantly varies with the conditions applied. Using primarily in situ anomalous x&#8208;ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) the source of this divergent behavior is revealed to be due to a migration of Cu throughout the framework, which in turn is predominantly controlled by the system's degree of hydration.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega) is a potent material for the selective conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) via the oxygen looping approach. However, its performance exhibits substantial variation depending on the operational conditions. Under an isothermal temperature regime, Cu&#8208;omega demonstrates subdued activity below 230&#8201;&#176;C, but experiences a remarkable increase in activity at 290&#8201;&#176;C. Applying a high&#8208;temperature activation protocol at 450&#8201;&#176;C causes a rapid deactivation of the material. This behavioral divergence is investigated by combining reactivity studies, neutron diffraction and in situ high&#8208;resolution anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (HR&#8208;AXRPD), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, to reveal that the migration of Cu throughout the framework is the primary cause of these behaviors, which in turn is predominantly governed by the degree of hydration of the system. This work suggests that control over the Cu migration throughout the zeolite framework may be harnessed to significantly increase the activity of Cu&#8208;omega by generating more active sites for the MtM conversion. These results underscore the power of in situ HR&#8208;AXRPD for unraveling the behavior of materials under reaction conditions and suggest that a re&#8208;evaluation of Cu&#8208;zeolites priorly deemed inactive for the MtM conversion across a broader range of conditions and looping protocols may be warranted.

         <title>Exchange of CO2 with CO as Reactant Switches Selectivity in Photoreduction on Co&#8722;ZrO2 from C1&#8211;3 Paraffin to Small Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathways from CO2 to paraffin while from CO to C2H4 and C3H6 using Co&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst were switched. CO2 at the O vacancy on ZrO2 transformed into COH and hopped onto Co0 to be paraffin while CO and H competed on Co0 leading to preferable coupling of CH2 to olefins.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2,3 hydrocarbons completes a C&#8208;neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C2,3 paraffin and C2H4 from CO2 are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co0&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst converted CO2 into C1&#8211;3 paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C2H4 and C3H6 (6.0&#177;0.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, 70&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only under UV/Visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under 13CO and H2, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C2H4 and C3H6 up to 61&#8211;87&#8197;mol&#8201;%, attributed to the accumulation of CH2 species at the interface between Co0 nanoparticles and the ZrO2 surface. CO2 adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO2 surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co0 surface to yield C1&#8211;3 paraffin using either H2 or H2O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co0 surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO2, respectively. This comprehensive study elucidates intricate photocatalytic pathways governing the transformation of CO2 into paraffin and CO to olefins.

         <dc:description>
Core fucosylation, catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is implicated in various diseases, making FUT8 inhibitors highly desirable. In their Research Article (e202414682), Yoshiyuki Manabe, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. developed FUT8 inhibitors with potent cellular activity. Through high&#8208;throughput screening and structural optimization, potent FUT8 inhibitors were identified. Additionally, prodrug derivatization enhanced the stability of these inhibitors, enabling the suppression of core fucose expression in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Improving the Selectivity and Stability of Supported Cobalt Catalysts via Static Bi&#8208;Doping and Dynamic Trace CO2 Co&#8208;Feeding During Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a strategy combining static and dynamic combination strategy to enhance both product selectivity and catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation. Static Bi doping facilitates electron transfer from Bi to Co, promoting C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and mitigating undesired side reactions. CO2 acts as a dynamic decarburizing agent that efficiently inhibits coking while prolonging catalyst lifespan.







Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing selectivity and stability on supported propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a combined static and dynamic strategy to address these issues synergistically. Firstly, we demonstrate a feasible sol&#8208;gel method for preparing atomically&#8208;dispersed Bi&#8208;decorated metal nanoparticle catalysts (MBi/Al2O3, M=Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). In PDH testing, the total selectivity of by&#8208;products (CH4 and C2H6) significantly decreases to 4&#8201;% for CoBi catalysts due to the static Bi&#8208;doping, compared with 16&#8201;% for Co&#8208;supported catalysts. Secondly, to enhance catalytic stability, we introduce a dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding route. 10CoBi/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit superior durability against coke formation for 330&#8197;hours in PDH under a 40&#8201;% C3H8 atmosphere followed by pure C3H8 conditions at 600&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining propylene selectivity at 96&#8201;%. Notably, introducing trace CO2 leads to a remarkable 6&#8208;fold decrease in the deactivation rate constant (kd). Multiple characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that charge transfer from atomically&#8208;distributed Bi to Co nanoparticles benefits lowering the energy of C3H6 adsorption thereby suppressing by&#8208;products. Furthermore, the dynamic co&#8208;feeding of trace CO2 facilitates coke removal, suppressing catalyst deactivation. The static Bi&#8208;doping and dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding strategy contributes simultaneously to increased selectivity and stability on supported PDH catalysts.

Notably, introducing trace CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a remarkable 6-fold decrease in the deactivation rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). Multiple characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that charge transfer from atomically-distributed Bi to Co nanoparticles benefits lowering the energy of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption thereby suppressing by-products. Furthermore, the dynamic co-feeding of trace CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates coke removal, suppressing catalyst deactivation. The static Bi-doping and dynamic trace CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; co-feeding strategy contributes simultaneously to increased selectivity and stability on supported PDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li2ZnCu3 Modified Cu Current Collector to Regulate Li Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the good lithiophilicity, low work function, Li+ ion concentration regulation, and strong anion interaction, of Li2ZnCu3 alloy, the surface modified&#8208;Cu can endow homogeneous initial Li deposition, thereby achieving a low&#8208;porosity and smooth Li deposition even at an ultrahigh Li loading of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as the high energy density of the 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 when coupled with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity cathode.







Abstract
Rationally designing a current collector that can maintain low lithium (Li) porosity and smooth morphology while enduring high&#8208;loading Li deposition is crucial for realizing the high energy density of Li metal batteries, but it is still challengeable. Herein, a Li2ZnCu3 alloy&#8208;modified Cu foil is reported as a stable current collector to fulfill the stable high&#8208;loading Li deposition. Benefiting from the in situ alloying, the generated numerous Li2ZnCu3@Cu heterojunctions induce a homogeneous Li nucleation and dense growth even at an ultrahigh capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Such a spatial structure endows the overall Li2ZnCu3@Cu electrode with the manipulated steric hindrance and outmost surface electric potential to suppress the side reactions during Li stripping and plating. The resultant Li||Li2ZnCu3@Cu asymmetric cell preserves an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200 cycles. Moreover, the Li&#8208;Li2ZnCu3@Cu||LiFePO4 cell maintains a cycling stability of 87.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. After coupling with the LiCoO2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the cell exhibits a high energy density of 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with remarkable cycling reversibility at an N/P ratio of 3. All these findings present a doable way to realize the high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and dense Li deposition for high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Integrated Ziegler&#8208;Natta/Brookhart&#8208;Ni Catalysts for the Synthesis of Sutured Polar High&#8208;Impact Polypropylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes using industrially&#8208;preferred heterogeneous catalysts is challenging due to the poisoning of polar functional groups towards metal center and the high stereo&#8208;selectivity requirement. In this work, dual&#8208;site catalysts combining Ziegler&#8208;Natta and Brookhart&#8208;Ni catalysts were used to produce polar polyolefin ionomers, followed by polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes containing isotactic polypropylene and branched polyethylene as toughening agents. Three combination modes between these catalysts were investigated, including mixed, core&#8208;shell, and integrated types. The integrated dual&#8208;site catalyst achieved the optimal material properties because the polyolefin ionomer acted as a suture molecule that stitched different components into a whole network. This produced sutured polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes with excellent mechanical properties and compatibility with polar substances. The restraining effect of the suture molecules greatly reduced the release of microplastic particles after aging. Moreover, the obtained polar high&#8208;impact polypropylene can serve as an efficient compatibilizer to recycle polyethylene/polypropylene mixed&#8208;waste plastics. This work provides an appealing and potentially practical strategy to upgrade the widely used polypropylenes and to alleviate the ever&#8208;growing plastic pollution issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Heavy n&#8208;type Behaviours in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Non&#8208;Conjugated Passivants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial issues between the perovskite film and electron transport layer greatly limit the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite organic ammonium passivants have been widely established as interfacial layers, they failed to improve electron extraction. Here, we reported that the heavy n&#8208;type characteristics in a low bandgap perovskite film could be modulated by incorporating non&#8208;conjugated ammonium passivants with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities. This resulted in a significant enhancement of electron extraction in the heavily n&#8208;type doped perovskite. The passivant&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 25.74% with an excellent fill factor of 85.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.166 V, which are significantly higher than that of the control device. The unencapsulated devices maintained 88% of their initial PCEs after 1,200 hours at 85 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivative (chemical substitution of the 9th carbon) crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of motions reminiscent of controllable sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate a critical obstacle&#160;towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in nonaerial environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8208;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selanyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8208;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selanylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron Enolates from Alkynes and Their&#160;Catalyst&#8208;Free Alkyne Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are powerful synthetic tools for constructing organic molecular frameworks. In this study, strongly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates were generated from alkynes through oxygen transfer from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide using tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. Boron enolates were highly reactive owing to the strong acidity of the boron centers, and thus immediately coupled with alkynes. N&#8208;Ethynylphthalimide reacted as an alkyne with 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide and B(C6F5)3 to form a semi&#8208;stable bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolate through the coordination of the carbonyl group to the boron center. This enolate underwent coupling with another alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2] Annulation for the Construction of Chiral Benzocyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric de novo synthesis of benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) via catalytic intermolecular reaction is highly desired for efficient access to this important class of compounds, yet such a strategy remains unmet challenge. Here, we report a Pd/Pyrox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation between arylboronic acids and functionalized alkenes, providing an unprecedented efficient protocol to access various enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs in a modular and versatile manner under mild conditions. A broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity has been achieved under the current protocol. The isolation and characterization of the key chiral palladacycle intermediate, together with DFT calculations, provides strong evidence for the catalytic pathway including an enantiodetermining arylpalladation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Free Alkaline Polyelectrolytes for Water Electrolyzers: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether&#8208;free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in&#8208;situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Modulation of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide toward Long&#8208;Enduring Anionic Redox with Fast Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with anionic redox reactions hold great potential for energy storage applications due to their ultra&#8208;high capacity and cost effectiveness. However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen&#8208;redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn&#8208;based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn&#8211;O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O&#8211;O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long&#8208;enduring reversible oxygen&#8208;redox activity (100% high capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 84.28% retention after 300 cycles at 5C). Time&#8208;resolved operando two&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero&#8208;strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra&#8208;low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1C: 1.75%, 1C: 0.31%, 5C: 0.04%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211 Wh kg&#8722;1 with superior performance. This work highlights the significance of crystal modulation and presents a universal approach in developing Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes with stable anionic redox for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild&#8208;condition Photocatalytic Reforming of Methanol&#8208;water by a Hierarchical, Asymmetry Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a reproducible intermediate for hydrogen (H2) and carbon cycling, methanol mixed with water (H2O) in a ratio of 1:1 can multiply the outcome of green H2 generation via Photocatalytic reforming of methanol&#8208;H2O (PRMW). Hitherto, low&#8208;energy and mild&#8208;condition PRMW remains a serious challenge. Here, the amino acid&#8208;derived carbon nitrides (ACN) were synthesized supramolecular precursor strategy for PRMW and achieved excellent performance (H2, 35.6 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1; CO2, 11.5 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) under sunlight at 35 &#176;C. We revealed that the surface&#8208;terminating carboxyl groups (&#8211;COOH) promote the dark dehydrogenation of methanol on MetCNx to form methoxy (&#8270;OCH3) and methylol (&#8270;CH2OH) simultaneously, with the hydroxyl (&#8270;OH) generated by photostimulated H2O oxidation promotes the C&#8208;H activation of formaldehyde, then leads the whole reaction into the formation of CO2 and three H2. The extended light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transport, and efficient surface reaction improve photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180 nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100 folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well-defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium-based metal-organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180 nm).

         <title>Engineered Nanobodies Bind Bismuth, Indium and Gallium for Applications in Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted theranostics heavily rely on metal isotopes conjugated to antibodies. Single&#8208;domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, are much smaller in size without compromising specificity and affinity. The conventional way of conjugating metals to nanobodies involves non&#8208;specific modification of amino acid residues with bifunctional chelating agents. We demonstrate that mutagenesis of a single residue in a nanobody creates a triple cysteine motif that selectively binds bismuth which is, for example, used in targeted alpha therapy. Two mutations create a quadruple cysteine mutant specific for gallium and indium used in positron emission tomography and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Labelling is quantitative within a few minutes. The metal nanobodies maintain structural integrity and stability over weeks, resist competition from endogenous metal binders like glutathione, and retain functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Modulation through the Inverted Energy Gap Law in Triply N&#9472;B&#8592;N&#8208;Containing Windmill&#8208;Shaped Triazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of windmill&#8208;shape heterocyclic molecules containing three N&#9472;B&#8592;N units, TBN and its derivatives, with quasi&#8208;planar C3 symmetric backbone, are synthesized. The parent TBN exhibits a strongly allowed, doubly degenerate lowest excited state but suffers from very low fluorescence, due to very fast nonradiative decay rate through a conical intersection (CI) as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Introducing peripheral phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;groups (Ph&#8208;TBN or Th&#8208;TBN) induces pronounced bathochromic shifts and enhances fluorescence, which is beneficial from inhibited nonradiative pathway by the increased energy barriers to access the CI at excited state. The understanding of this rather uncommon behaviour may open routes for the design of novel fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanoprobes with Tunable Exchange Coupling for High Resolution and Sensitive Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has demonstrated versatile applications in biomedicine, including tumor imaging, cell tracking, and image&#8208;guided hyperthermia. Despite these advancements, the prevalent use of clinically approved tracers has posed limitations on MPI's resolution and sensitivity. In this study, we engineered a bimagnetic core/shell nanocrystals (BMCS) tailored for MPI by optimizing the heterostructure and modulating the exchange coupling effect between the two magnetic components. The resulting BMCS exhibited remarkably heightened susceptibility and magnetization while maintaining low coercivity, thereby substantially improved both MPI resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional tracers such as VivoTrax. At an equivalent mass concentration, BMCS demonstrated a notable 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieved an unprecedentedly high resolution down to 1 mm. The excellent MPI performance contributes to high resolution MPI and the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. The design strategy employed in BMCS, centered on the exchange coupling effect, introduces an efficacious approach for the development of high performance MPI tracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Silver Clusters from Ag57 to Ag72 via Laminating Multiple Different Anion Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The established capability of anion templates in precisely manipulating the size, geometry, and function of metal clusters is well acknowledged. However, the development of a systematic methodology for orchestrating the assembly of silver clusters, particularly those encompassing multiple distinct types of anion templates, remains elusive due to the formidable synthetic challenge. In this work, we report two novel silver clusters, Ag57 and Ag72, using two and three different anion templates, respectively. Ag57 features a gyroscope&#8208;like monovalent cation with an Ag3 triangle core sandwiched by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722; and a triad of Cl&#8722; anion templates. By intentionally introducing the third anion template, SO42&#8722;, the structure is expanded to the unprecedented Ag72 (with 15 silver atoms epitaxially grown on top of Ag57) resembling a tumbler, inside of which two Ag3 layers are laminated by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722;, seven Cl&#8722; and one SO42&#8722; anion templates in parallel with respect to longitudinal orientation. It is noteworthy that Ag72 exhibits remarkable structural complexity and represents a pioneering achievement as the first silver cluster incorporating three distinct types of anion templates. In addition, Ag72 demonstrates a significant advantage over Ag57, particular in terms of applications such as luminescent thermometers and remote laser ignition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Hidden Mechanism: Excited&#8208;State Proton&#8208;Electron Pair Transfer in Metal Nanocluster Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comprehending the underlying factors that govern photoluminescence (PL) in metal nanoclusters (NCs) under physiological conditions remains a highly intriguing and unresolved challenge, particularly for their biomedical applications. In this study, we evaluate the critical role of excited&#8208;state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer in the emission of metal NCs. Our findings demonstrate that hydronium ion (H3O+) binding can trigger a nonlinear, pH&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state concerted electron proton transfer (CEPT) reaction. This involves simultaneous electron transfer from the Au(0) core to the Au(I)&#8208;ATT (ATT denotes 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymidine) surface and proton transfer from H3O+ to the ATT ligand in a single step, greatly promoting vibrations and rotations of the Au(I)&#8208;ATT surface, resulting in substantial PL quenching of Au10(ATT)6 NCs. Further analyses show that the unique CEPT dynamics are strongly influenced by the opposing effects of increased reorganization energy and a larger pre&#8208;exponential factor on the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the proposed excited&#8208;state CEPT process is found to be prevalent in core&#8208;shell relaxation metal NCs, such as Au25(SR)18 (SR denotes thiolate) NCs, and serves as an important factor in limiting their PL emission. By simply controlling the pKa of the ligands, the emission performance of Au25(SR)18 can be easily regulated in physiological environments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Because of the unique and superior optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted great interests in photocatalysis. Element doping strategy is adopted to modify perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance. However, the contribution of bare doping&#8208;site onto photocatalytic efficiency, and the correlation between doping locations and activity have not yet to be demonstrated. This&#160;promoted us to explore the potential of A&#8208;site&#8208;doped MHPs for photocatalysis. Herein, we dope potassium (K+) into CsPbBr3 and first reveal that the occupied locations of K+ in CsPbBr3 is lattice incorporation rather than surface segregation, which would change from A&#8208;site substitution to interstitial site in lattice with the increase of K+ concentrations. Taking H2 evolution as a model reaction, photocatalytic activity of CsPbBr3 after K+ doping could be significantly improved ~11&#8208;fold with A&#8208;site substitution, which is superior to that of interstitial site doping. Moreover, other alkali metals including Li, Na, and Rb doping give the same results. The structure of photocatalysts during reaction confirmed the contribution of A&#8208;site doping onto enhanced photocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights show it is a result of the relaxed residual lattice strain induced promoted charge&#8208;carriers dynamics and formed upward shifting of band after K+ A&#8208;site doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Corannulene&#8208;based Quintuple [6]/[7]helicenes: Well&#8208;preserved Bowl Core, Inhibited Bowl Inversion and Supramolecular Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, corannulene&#8208;based quintuple [6]helicenes (Q[6]H&#8208;1 andQ[6]H&#8208;2) and [7]helicene (Q[7]H) were synthesized via penta&#8208;fold Heck and Mallory reaction. Notably, Q[7]H represents the highest reported helicene based on corannulene. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, while Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[7]H exhibit quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformations. Upon heating, conformer Q[6]H&#8208;1 undergoes conversion to the thermodynamically more stable conformer Q[6]H&#8208;2, whereas conformer Q[7]H remains unchanged due to larger steric congestion. Racemization of the enantiomer of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and conformational conversion were observed simultaneously at elevated temperature, with DFT studies indicating a racemization barrier of 28.64 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1. In contrast, the racemization barrier for Q[6]H&#8208;2 was calculated to be 45.46 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1, indicating exceptional chiral stability. Surprisingly, the bowl inversions of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers are somewhat inhibited by the helical blades, whereas this was not observed for other possible conformers of Q[6]H. These results first demonstrated that subtle conformational variations can lead to significant changes in chiral stability and bowl inversions of multihelicenes. Due to the well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, propeller&#8208;shaped conformation and electron complementarity, Q[6]H&#8208;2 can recognize fullerenes in both solution and solid state, which is a rare instance of co&#8208;crystallization assembly between multiple helicenes and fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline NiO for Industrial&#8208;Scale Electrocatalytic PET Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of plastic waste into valuable chemicals through innovative and selective nano&#8208;catalysts offers significant economic benefits and positive environmental impacts. However, our current understanding of catalyst design capable of achieving industrial&#8208;grade current densities is limited. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;supported amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate and hydrogen (H2) fuel. The catalyst achieves an industrial current density of over 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, with an 80% Faradaic efficiency and a formate production rate of 7.16 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the rapid transformation of amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH at the amorphous&#8208;crystalline interface provides a thermodynamic advantage for formate desorption, leading to the high activity required for industrial applications, which is difficult to achieve for fully crystalline NiO. A techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates that recycling waste PET using this catalytic process could generate a profit of $501 per ton. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient approach to promoting the sustainable utilization of waste PET.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologation of Alkenyl Carbonyls via a Cyclopropanation/Light&#8208;Mediated Selective C&#8208;C Cleavage Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein our studies on the direct photoactivation of carbonyl cyclopropanes to give biradical intermediates, leading to selective cleavage of the more substituted carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Depending on the substrate structure, extended alkenes were isolated or directly reacted in a photo&#8208;Nazarov process to give bicyclic products. Based on these results, a unified reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction was developed by using diphenyl disulfide as a HAT reagent. By performing a sequential cyclopropanation/selective ring opening reaction, we achieved a CH2 insertion into the &#945;,&#946; bond of both acyclic and cyclic unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Our protocol provides a further tool for the modification of the carbon framework of organic compounds, complementing the recent progress in &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite&#160; H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT&#160; Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. A well&#8208;grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#246;nsted&#8208;acidic zeolites. We show that the tert&#8208;butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8208;&#8208;873 K), being therefore a short&#8208;lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.</dc:description>
