         <title>The Interplay Between Component Denticity and Flexibility Promotes the Formation of [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised Links and Knots</title>

         <dc:description>
The interplay between the diamine&#8216;s flexibility and the coordination domain&#8216;s denticity governed the self&#8208;assembly of four distinct [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised architectures. Reactions with 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine produced molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link, while 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot. Selected assemblies showed interesting luminescent properties.







Abstract
A subtle interplay between the flexibility of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;based diamine and the denticity of the coordination domain formed upon self&#8208;assembly enabled the formation of four distinct topologies stabilised by [Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag]2+ pairs. The reactions utilising 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine resulted in the formation of silver(I)&#8208;stabilised molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link. The 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot, demonstrating very close AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI distances. Two of the studied assemblies demonstrated interesting luminescent properties in the solid state.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper designs a series of nonplanar and precise triple&#8208;coordinated SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis and proposes a new descriptor (&#916;&#1013;d&#8208;p). Moreover, constant&#8208;potential kinetics explain a low kinetic barrier under alkaline conditions due to hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the OOH* intermediate and interfacial water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) with metal atoms triple&#8208;coordinated by pyrrole&#8208;N, for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor on the energy difference between d&#8208;band center of metal sites and p&#8208;band centers of N&#8208;ligands (&#916;&#1013;d&#8722;p) is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951;=0.08&#8197;eV) and selectivity, as well as a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition owing to a strong hydrogen bonding between OOH* intermediate and interfacial water, which is then experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92&#8201;%) under alkaline condition. This study thus presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the performance&#8208;oriented and precise coordination design of nonplanar SACs for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, and, more importantly, provides an essential complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities of catalysts with nonplanar configurations for series potential electrochemical processes.

         <title>Regularly Arranged Heterogeneous Pores in Gas Separation Membranes Constructed by Cocrystallization of Porous Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating two or more materials to construct membranes with heterogeneous pore structures is an effective strategy for enhancing separation performance. Regularly arranging these heterogeneous pores can significantly optimize the combined effect of the introduced components. Porous Organic Cages (POCs), an emerging subclass of porous materials composed of discrete molecules, assemble to form interconnected pores and exhibit permanent porosity in the solid state. A unique feature of POCs is their modularity, enabling a "mix and match" approach to create co&#8208;crystal structures driven by the intermolecular interactions. Herein, we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating gas separation membranes. We prepared membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. By optimizing the cocrystalization conditions, we successfully fabricated continuous, defect&#8208;free gas membranes, benefiting from chiral recognition interactions. By introducing regularly alternating small and large pores, we addressed challenges such as the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in gas separation membrane. Moreover, the cocrystallization strategy has been proven effective for other molecular systems besides POCs, such as macrocycles, for the preparation of co&#8208;crystal membranes. This method broadens the scope for fabricating high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes with ordered heterogeneous pores.</dc:description>

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8315; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8315;) with Cl&#8315; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8315;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8315;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30 K and 1 bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8315;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50 K and 1 mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8315; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.</dc:description>

However, this process is impeded by slow kinetics and limited Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to a poor understanding of the reaction mechanism. Herein, NiCo2O4/CeO2 is developed to enable the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to AA with a 0.0992 mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 yield rate and 87% Faradaic efficiency at a lower potential. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that cyclohexanol electrooxidation to AA is a gradual oxidation process involving the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, the generation of 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone, and subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. Theoretical calculations reveal that electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, leading to AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE. Kinetic analysis further elucidates the effect of CeO2 on promoting cyclohexanone adsorption and activation on the electrode surface, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, a two&#8208;electrode flow reactor is constructed to produce 72.1 mmol AA and 10.4 L H2 by using KA oil as the anode feedstock at 2.5 A (200 mA cm&#8722;2), demonstrating promising potential.</dc:description>

         <title>1.5D Chiral Perovskites Mediated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network with Remarkable Spin&#8208;Polarized Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we developed new chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, by incorporating achiral guanidinium (GA+) and chiral R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA+) into the perovskite framework. The resulting materials possess a distinctive structural configuration, positioned between 1D and 2D perovskites, which we describe as 1.5D. This structure is featured by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag inorganic chains, further forming an organized layered architecture. The structural dimensionality affects both electronic and spin&#8208;related properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal Rashba splitting induced by the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure, while circularly polarized transient absorption spectroscopy confirms spin lifetime on the nanosecond timescale. Magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (mCP&#8208;AFM) measurements demonstrate exceptional chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) with maximum spin polarization degrees of (92 &#177; 1)% and (&#8208;94 &#177; 2)% for (R&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 and (S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, also highlight the critical role of chemical environment in sculpturing the structural dimension and spin&#8208;polarized property of chiral perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.</dc:description>

         <title>Buffered Hydroxyl Radical for Photocatalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative Methane Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxy radical (&#8226;OH) is a prestigious oxidant that allows the cleavage of strong chemical bonds of methane but is untamed, leading to over&#8208;oxidation of methane and waste of oxidants, especially at high methane conversion. Here, we managed to buffer &#8226;OH in an aqueous solution of photo&#8208;irradiated Fe3+, where &#8226;OH almost participates in methane oxidation. Due to the interaction between Fe3+ and SO42&#8722;, the electron transfer from OH&#8722; to excited&#8208;state Fe3+ for &#8226;OH generation is retarded, while excessive &#8226;OH is consumed by generated Fe2+ to restore Fe3+. When combined with a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst, the buffered &#8226;OH converts methane to C2+ hydrocarbons and H2 with formation rates of 246 and 418 &#956;mol h&#8722;1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches 13.0 &#177; 0.2%, along with 10.2% methane conversion and 81% C2+ selectivity after 80 hours of reaction. Overall, this work presents a strategy for controlling active radicals for selective and efficient photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plastic waste accumulation requires facile yet effective solutions. Currently mechanical recycling typically leads to downcycling, while the environmental footprint of chemical recycling is often unacceptable. Here, we introduce a dual circularity concept, where rational molecular design paves the way for complementary closed&#8208;loop mechanical and chemical recyclability under mild conditions. Very small changes in macromolecular structures, thermal and mechanical properties were observed, after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, showing that a wide processing window could be the key for closing the mechanical recycling loop. Facile, time and energy efficient closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling into products with identical performance to original ones was also realized, thanks to the abundant free volume and accessible ester&#8208;functionalities. With these design criteria at hand, dual circulation in recyclability can be realized; proceeding with mechanical recycling when we can, and switching to chemical recycling when we must.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence of Interpenetrated Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (TPE&#8208;MOFs) by Linker Installation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene&#8208;based MOF (TPE&#8208;MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine&#8208;tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections, reaching an impressive 8801 GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145 ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Drug for the Self&#8208;Checking of Mitophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitophagy that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), represents a critical focus in pharmacology. However, the discovery and evaluation of MMP&#8208;disrupting drugs are often hampered using commercially available marker molecules that target similar or identical zones. These markers can significantly interfere with, obscure, or amplify the functional effects of MMP&#8208;targeting drugs, frequently leading to clinical failures. In response to this challenge, we propose a &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy that integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting within a single small&#8208;molecule drug. We have developed a novel mitophagy self&#8208;check drug (MitoSC) that exhibits dual&#8208;color and dual&#8208;localization properties. The functional component of this system is a variable&#160;MitoSC&#160;that disrupts MMP homeostasis, thereby inducing mitophagy. Upon activation, this component transforms into a blue&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;fun) specifically within the mitochondrial target zone. The biological reporting component is represented by a red&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;rep) that localizes to lysosomes, the non&#8208;target zone. As mitophagy progresses, the fluorescent signals from&#160;MitoSC&#8208;rep&#160;(lysosomes) and&#160;MitoSC&#8208;fun&#160;(mitochondria) converge, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the mitophagy process. Our findings underscore the potential of a single&#8208;molecule drug to exert target&#8208;zone specific actions while simultaneously providing non&#8208;target zone self&#8208;checking, offering a new perspective for drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyrrole&#8208;Fused Nanographene and its Edge&#8208;Perchlorinated Derivative Featuring a Corannulene Core and Five N&#8208;doped Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrrole&#8208;fused analogue of warped nanographene, designated as deca&#8208;nitrogen doped 'WNG' (azaWNG), was synthesized through the annular fusion of decapyrroylcorannulene. The resulting azaWNG exhibited extremely limited solubility in common organic solvents and was characterized solely by mass spectrometry. Theoretical calculations revealed that azaWNG has a sunflower&#8208;like molecular structure with electron&#8208;deficient corannulene as the core and electron&#8208;rich pyrrole as the petals, demonstrating a significantly narrower energy gap compared to all&#8208;carbon WNG. To improve its solubility and facilitate precise structural characterization, iodine monochloride was utilized for edge&#8208;perchlorination of azaWNG, enabling successful separation and purification of chlorinated azaWNG in solution phase. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis unequivocally confirmed that edge&#8208;perchlorinated azaWNG contains 5 heptagons and 11 pentagons embedded within the warped &#960; skeleton. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the first oxidation potential of azaWNG is &#8211;0.59 V, representing the lowest value reported for any previously studied aza&#8208;nanographene. Consequently, azaWNG can be readily oxidized by AgPF6 or even atmospheric oxygen to yield stable oxidation states, as corroborated by UV&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy; this behavior is attributed to the fusion of ten pyrroles around corannulene. This work marks the first instance of nitrogen doping in WNG (C80H30), underscoring the significant modification to electronic structure induced by such doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Carbon&#8208;centered Radical Sites for Promoting the 4e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical covalent organic frameworks (RCOFs) have demonstrated significant potential in redox catalysis and energy conversion applications. However, the synthesis of stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers is challenging due to the inherent radical instability, limited synthetic methods and characterization difficulties. Building upon the understanding of stable carbon radicals and structural modulations for preparing crystalline COFs, herein we report the synthesis of a crystalline carbon&#8208;centered RCOF through a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. Moreover, the RCOF demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in the 4e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82 V (vs. RHE) and electron transfer number of 3.98, among the highest in reported COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The promoted 4e&#8208; and suppressed 2e&#8208; ORR pathway (99.5% vs. 0.5%) can be attributed to facilitated reaction initiation and smoother transition steps at the carbon radical sites, which is practically beneficial for minimizing peroxide formation, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications. Overall, our study not only provided a facile strategy for preparing stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers but also demonstrated their capability to fine&#8208;tune the redox catalytic activity of COF materials, which could be potentially useful in electrocatalysis and energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Acetylene Layered Hybrid Perovskites in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptional potential in converting solar energy to electric power in photovoltaics, yet their application is hampered by limited operational stability. This stimulated the development of hybrid layered (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D) halide perovskites based on hydrophobic organic spacers, templating perovskite slabs, as a more stable alternative. However, conventional organic spacer cations are electronically insulating, resulting in charge confinement within the inorganic slabs, thus limiting their functionality. This can be ameliorated by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the spacer cations. We&#160;demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating for the first time aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based (4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methylammonium (BMAA) and buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylbis(4,1&#8208;phenylene)dimethylammonium (BDAA) spacers, respectively. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and apply them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior device performances with a power conversion efficiency of up to 23% and higher operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Defects as Highly Active Sites for Gold Detection and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon defects of carbon dot as an active sites for the reduction of gold. The formation of gold particles involves the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (fast) and an Ostwald ripening process (slow). Importantly, this process occurs independently of interference from other ions, and self&#8208;settling is observed in this mechanism. This interplay between carbon defects and gold ions highlights a nuanced pathway for the creation of Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
The use of precious metals (PMs) in many areas, such as printed circuit boards, catalysts, and target drugs, is increasing due to their unique physical and chemical properties, but their recovery remains a great challenge in terms of zero&#8208;valent PMs as the final product. We report a highly hydrophilic carbon dot (CD) as a reductant (electron donor), in which the defects in CD served as efficient active sites for zero&#8208;valent PMs recovery with an electron&#8208;donating capacity of ~1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The reduction of gold follows a two&#8208;step dynamic model characterized by the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (initial rapid electron transfer process) followed by an Ostwald ripening process (subsequent slow process). Finite element method (FEM) simulation shows that the reaction efficiency and confinement effect of AuCl4&#8722; ions are positively correlated with defect density, indicating that the quantitative control of carbon defect density is the key to enhancing reduction activity. Combining density functional theory (DFT) with XPS and FTIR technology, we found that the electron is transferred from CD to Au(III) via hydrogen bonding. This nano carbon material can be exploited to recover gold from e&#8208;waste water directly, with the characteristics of reducing energy consumption and avoiding environmental pollution.

         <title>Enhancing battery longevity by regulating the solvation chemistry of organic iodide</title>

Incorporating formamidinium iodide into zinc&#8208;iodine batteries regulates the solvation chemistry to enhance redox kinetics and suppress polyiodide dissolution for improved longevity.







Abstract
For rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, the low electrical conductivity of iodine and the easy dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte need to be carefully managed to ensure efficient operation. Herein, we introduce an organic iodized salt, formamidinium iodide (CH5N2I), to modulate the solvation structure of iodide ion, aimed to improve the reaction kinetics of iodine for reversible redox conversion. The participation of formamidinium ion (FA+) into solvation structure leads to the formation of the favorable FAIZn(H2O)42+ complex, facilitating easier desolvation for redox conversion with iodine. Consequently, the inhibited formation of soluble polyiodide efficiently suppresses self&#8208;discharging and improves reversible redox conversion. Specifically, the fabricated battery demonstrates extraordinary cycling stability, with 90.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. These results provide inspiring principles to develop organohalide materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries through the solvation modification and interface regulation strategies.

         <title>Multifaceted Hidden Catalysis Revealed by Mechanistic Analysis of FeBr3&#8208;Catalysed Arene Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic analysis revealed the iron&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ([H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]2) operates through hidden catalysis with the iron salt mediating the formation of Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, the active catalyst. The reaction was shown to proceed through an electrophilic borylation mechanism.







Abstract
Arene borylation reactions provide direct access to aryl organoboranes, including aryl boronic esters. Precious metals, namely Ir, Rh, Pt, remain the go&#8208;to for metal&#8208;catalysed borylation reactions, however, significant efforts have been expended in developing Earth&#8208;abundant metal alternatives. The iron&#8208;catalysed borylation of 2&#8208;aryl pyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN) offers unique reactivity by using only FeBr3 as the catalyst, without added ligand(s). Mechanistic analysis of this borylation reaction revealed an alternative, hidden catalysis pathway whereby the iron salt acts not as a borylation catalyst, but as an initiator for the generation of a catalytically active haloborane, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. The roles of iron salt, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, and HBr in catalyst formation, the mode of catalytic turnover, and catalyst regeneration were all determined using single&#8208;turnover and catalytic studies. The borylation reaction was found to proceed by a catalytic electrophilic borylation using, in situ generated, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. These studies highlight a new, orthogonal method of generating haloboranes and their previously unobserved role as hidden catalysts within arene borylation reactions.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Mussel&#8208;inspired Adhesive Polymers as a Novel Class of Transient Enzyme Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical oxidation of multifunctional catechols represents a &#8220;green&#8221; and clean alternative pathway to ortho&#8208;quinones, which are used to form oligomer networks with branched multi&#8208;thiols. In these networks, the catechols are restored and represent adhesive points, which can establish transient interactions with enzymes. These oligomer/enzyme&#8208;conjugates are shielding the enzymes from heat stress, thus preventing denaturation.







Abstract
Multifunctional ortho&#8208;quinones are required for the formation of thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) but can be delicate to handle. We present the electrochemical oxidation of the dipeptide DiDOPA, achieving up to 92&#8201;% conversion efficiency of the catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. Graphite and stainless steel could be employed as cost&#8208;efficient electrodes. The electrochemical activation yields quinone&#8208;solutions, which are free of undesired reactive compounds and eliminates the challenging step of isolating the reactive quinones. The DiDOPA quinones were employed in polyaddition reactions with multi&#8208;thiols, forming oligomers that functioned as transient enzyme stabilizers (TES). These TCC&#8208;TES&#8208;additives improved the thermal stability and the activity of tyrosinase in heat stress assays.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Topology&#8208;Controlled BODIPY and CO2&#8208;Based Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first successful direct synthesis of topology&#8208;controlled BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs with distinct fcu and hcp topologies, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. Both materials exhibited excellent crystallinity and demonstrated suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO, using H2O as the electron donor, achieving the high CO yields up to 16.72&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) possess strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities and great potential for artificial photosynthesis without the use of sacrificial reagents. However, their direct preparation has not yet been achieved due to challenges in synthesizing suitable ligands. Herein, we reported the first successful direct synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. By controlling synthetic conditions, we successfully obtained two distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The first, CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB, exhibits a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcu) topology based on a Zr6(&#956;3&#8208;O)4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4 node, while the second, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB, features a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) topology, structured around a Zr12(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(&#956;3&#8208;OH)8(&#956;2&#8208;OH)6 node. Both MOFs demonstrated excellent crystallinity, as verified through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. These MOF catalysts displayed suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for the reduction of CO2 to CO using H2O as the electron donor in the absence of co&#8208;catalyst or toxic sacrificial reagent. Under light irradiation, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB and CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB offered high CO yields of 16.72 and 13.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity. CO2 uptake and photoelectrochemical experiments revealed key insights into the mechanisms driving the different catalytic activities of the two MOFs. These BODIPY and CO2&#8208;based, light&#8208;responsive Zr&#8208;MOFs represent a promising platform for the development of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Bionic Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy&#8208;Dense and Rapid Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging electrospinning technology in combination with coordination chemistry, capillary&#8208;like hollow carbon nanofibers were synthesized. Attributable to their unique microstructure and optimized nanopore size, those nanofibers, when employed as cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, achieve battery&#8208;level energy density at high power outputs, coupled with remarkable cycling stability.







Abstract
Suboptimal spatial utilization and inefficient access to internal porosity preclude porous carbon cathodes from delivering high energy density in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs). Inspired by the function of capillaries in biological systems, this study proposes a facile coordination&#8208;pyrolysis method to fabricate thin&#8208;walled hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with optimized pore structure and surface functional groups for ZIHCs. The capillary&#8208;like CNFs maximize the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitating the optimal utilization of energy storage sites. The precision&#8208;engineered pore sizes in the fiber walls are specifically tailored to accommodate solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+, thus enhancing ion storage capacity and supporting accelerated transport kinetics. The resultant ZIHCs achieve a battery&#8208;grade energy density of 132.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (based on active material), remarkable stability (98.7&#8201;% retention after 80,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), along with practically high areal capacities. Combined in situ/ex&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations revealed that the superior energy storage performance arises from the advantageous microstructure of the biomimetic CNFs and the reversible physical/chemical adsorption process. This investigation offers a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency zinc ion storage carbon nanomaterials and provides insights into the cathodic storage mechanisms essential for advancing ZIHCs.

         <title>Innate Immune Activation with Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the roles of innate immune modulators (IIMs) in cancer therapy and their ability to enhance the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade and summarizes recent progress in the development of IIM nanotherapeutics to target cGAS&#8208;STING, TLR, and RLR pathways. Multifunctional nanoparticles combining IIMs and chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or tumor vaccines are discussed next, followed by brief summaries of the lessons learned, current challenges, and future perspectives in optimizing IIM nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies. However, its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and other regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. Innate immune modulators (IIMs) provide potent immune activation to complement adaptive immune responses and help overcome resistance to ICB. This minireview provides an overview of IIMs and their roles in antitumor immune responses and summarizes recent advances in developing nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of IIMs to tumors for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and mitigating systemic toxicity. We discuss innovative nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of IIMs targeting the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes pathway, the toll&#8208;like receptor pathway, and the retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I&#8208;like receptor pathway. We review the preliminary clinical readouts of representative IIM nanoptherapeutics and highlight the development of multifunctional nanoparticles for combination treatments of IIMs with conventional treatment mdoalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynmic therapy, and tumor antigens. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the existing systems, the challenges in the field, and future perspectives for this exciting field of nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Lewis Base Activation of Carbonyls and Hexafluorobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto elusive side&#8208;on Pd(0) arene and organic carbonyl complexes are reported, as well as the catalytic hydrodefluorination of hexafluorobenzene by cyclohexene. Detailed spectroscopic studies and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations reveal that bonding between Pd(0) and &#960;&#8208;ligands may occur, opposed to common belief, by two different mechanisms. Hence, we present evidence for selective &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of &#960;&#8208;systems.







Abstract
We report hitherto elusive side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;bonded palladium(0) carbonyl (anthraquinone, benzaldehyde) and arene (benzene, hexafluorobenzene) palladium(0) complexes and present the catalytic hydrodefluorination of hexafluorobenzene by cyclohexene. The comparison with respective cyclohexene, pyridine and tetrahydrofuran complexes reveals that the experimental ligand binding strengths follow the order THF&lt;C6H6&lt;C6F6&lt;cyclohexene&lt;pyridine&lt;benzaldehyde&lt;anthraquinone. To understand this surprising order, the complexes&#8217; electronic structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), single crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD), ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) electronic absorption, infrared (IR) vibrational, Pd L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopic techniques, complemented by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations including energy decomposition (EDA&#8208;NOCV) and effective oxidation state (EOS) analyses. For benzene, pyridine and cyclohexene, bonding follows the donor/acceptor picture of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. In stark contrast, hexafluorobenzene, benzaldehyde and anthraquinone bind via essentially the &#960;&#8208;channel only and thus as &#960;&#8208;analogues of Z&#8208;acceptor ligands. This contribution elucidates the control of functional&#8208;group selectivity in palladium(0) catalysis and delineates a novel strategy to activate electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>B12&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzymes Catalyze C&#8208;Fluoromethylation via a CH2F&#8208;Cobalamin Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferases were found to fluoromethylate unactivated carbon centers of peptide and natural products. This process was initiated by the 5'&#8208;dA radical produced from F&#8208;SAM and involved the important intermediate CH2F&#8208;cobalamin.







Abstract
Fluorine and fluorine&#8208;containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12&#8208;RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT. QCMT can cleave F&#8208;SAM to produce the 5'&#8208;dA radical. The significant reaction intermediate CH2FCbI was characterized by HR&#8208;MS, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, B12&#8208;RSMTs CysS and GenD1 can also transfer fluoromethyl groups onto natural products. We also found that F&#8208;SAM is not compulsory. The reduced B12&#8208;RSMTs can directly generate CH2FCbI with CH2FI and transfer the CH2F group when SAM is used as the radical initiator. Our results demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated enzymatic strategy for fluoromethylation with abiological cofactors and expand radical SAM enzymes to the field of fluorine chemistry.

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long range proton migrations are known to play a role in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. This study demonstrates the involvement of long distance hydrogen transfers also in the mass spectrometric fragmentation, and combined approaches through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and enzymatic conversion of designed substrate analogs give detailed insights into their involvement in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene and related compounds.







Abstract
Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxa-4,11-diene is made by the taxa-4,11-diene synthase (TxS) from &lt;i&gt;Taxus brevifolia&lt;/i&gt;. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI-MS fragmentation of taxa-4,11-diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa-4,11-diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Dicarboxylation of Vinyl Epoxide with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of Diacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electrochemical dicarboxylation of vinyl epoxides using CO2, featuring a CO2 radical anion addition induced sequential cleavage of two C&#8211;O bonds. This method displays high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity and is applicable to &#945;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8208;styryl epoxides, and cyclic carbonates. The versatility of the resulting multifunctional diacids is highlighted by their diverse functionalizations.







Abstract
We present a novel electrochemical dicarboxylation of epoxides with CO2, characterized by the cleavage of two C&#8722;O single bonds. Not only are vinyl epoxides viable, but cyclic carbonates also serve as effective substrates, facilitating the synthesis of E&#8208;configured adipic and octanedioic acids with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic practicality is further highlighted by the diverse functionalizations of the resulting multifunctional diacids. Mechanistic studies support the single&#8208;electron transfer reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO2, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.

         <title>Autocatalytic Interfacial Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Amide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal two&#8208;step method based on autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP) has enabled the synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes with Turing structures. The representative AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane with its built&#8208;in robust amide knots exhibits a good performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built&#8208;in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra&#8208;long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.

         <title>Establishing the Link Between Oxygen Vacancy and Activity Enhancement in Acidic Water Oxidation of Trigonal Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and sustained activity for over 650 hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70 V (~1200 mA cm&#8208;2) for over 140 hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8208;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Heck Silylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes is an efficient strategy for the synthesis of useful organosilicon compounds. However, extensive efforts have been dedicated to only achieving achiral molecules. Herein, a highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilanes is reported for the first time, providing access to axially chiral alkenes in good to excellent yields with 87&#8208;98% ee. Aryl and alkyl groups as well as quaternary carbon centers at the 4&#8208;position of vinylcyclohexane could be well tolerated, featuring good functional group tolerance. The gram&#8208;scale reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions even with 0.5 mol% catalyst loading. A possible mechanism has been proposed, in which enantioselectivity is controlled by alkene insertion. A templating strategy that enhances weak bond interaction is employed to control regioselectivity by modifying the substituents on the ligand and silane.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of TADF by Internal and External Heavy Atom Effect in D&#8208;A MOF for Heterocrystal based Temperature&#8208;Compensated Photonic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8208;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8208;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592 nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02%&#8208;47.39%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8208;A regimes featuring substituent&#8208;based linkers. Notably, temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8208;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215 K to 295 K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8208;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The application of temperature-compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymer Tubesomes: Boosting Gas Delivery of Nanovehicles via Membrane Stretching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as a gasotransmitter,&#160;not only plays a vital role in mediating many cellular activities but also manifests exciting applications in clinical therapy. However, one main obstacle in using H2S as a gaseous therapeutic agent is to realize on&#8208;demand storage and delivery of gas, and thus, it is of great importance to develop H2S&#8208;donating vehicle platforms. Although a variety of polymer&#8208;based gas&#8208;releasing carriers have been designed, almost all the systems are limited to spherical structures. Here we explore the role of polymer self&#8208;assembled morphologies, especially toward those non&#8208;spherical nanostructures, on the H2S release capacity. A kind of tubular polymersomes (i.e. tubesomes), formed by the membrane stretching of polythionoester&#8208;containing block copolymer vesicles, exhibit enhanced cysteine&#8208;responsive H2S&#8208;releasing behavior in contrast to their spherical counterparts. Moreover, we found that the amount and rate of H2S release from diverse polymersomes is relied on the extent of membrane elongation, which allows us to regulate the gas releasing kinetics through tailoring the membrane geometries. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the tubesomes as polymer&#8208;type H2S donors have better anticancer performance than those spherical polymersomes. This would inspire new possibilities to boost gas therapeutic efficacy through shaping the morphology of gas nanovehicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8211;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8211;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidine as an Easy&#8208;On and Easy&#8208;Off Linker for Reversible Crosslinking of Two Alkyl Amines in Peptide Stapling and Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino groups are abundant in both natural and synthetic molecules, offering highly accessible sites for modifying native biorelevant molecules. Despite significant progress with more reactive thiol groups, methods for connecting two amino groups with reversible linkers for bioconjugation applications remain elusive. Herein, we report the use of oxidative decarboxylative condensation of glyoxylic acid to crosslink two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, applicable in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular contexts. This linking chemistry exhibits unique hetero&#8208;coupling selectivity between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Although the formamidine linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral buffers and acidic conditions, it can be readily cleaved with ethylenediamine or hydrazine under mild conditions in alcohol solvents or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups. This study introduces a rare &#8216;easy&#8208;on and easy&#8208;off&#8217; strategy for connecting two native amines in peptide stapling and biomolecule conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorescence Behavior of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes from the Perspective of Excited State Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have diverse applications in luminescence, imaging and sensing. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of CMA complexes, which were subsequently doped into a PMMA host. These materials demonstrate light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence, attributed to their long intrinsic triplet state lifetime (&#964;P,int, in the &#956;s&#8208;ms scale), high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant (kISC, up to 107 s&#8208;1), and bright phosphorescence. The extended &#964;P,int, and elevated kISC facilitate efficient sensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is rapidly consumed by the host material, creating a localized anaerobic environment conducive to bright phosphorescence emission. The Sn&#8208;T1 process exhibits a large spin&#8208;orbital coupling matrix element (SOCME) value, while the SOCME value between T1 and S0 is comparatively smaller, resulting in a large kISC and long &#964;P,int, Computational results indicate that the hole&#8208;electron configuration in the lowest triplet state exhibits low contributions from gold. Based on the dynamic phosphorescence properties, an encryption material capable of achieving a "burn after reading" effect was developed. This work illustrates that those phosphorescent emitters with minimal heavy atom contribution can produce dynamic phosphorescent phenomena, providing a novel strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Hybrid Vanadium&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Targeted Tool for Selective Protein Oxidative Modifications and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of oxidative modification on protein structure and functions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to combat macromolecular damage and cell death. However, selectively inducing oxidative modifications in proteins&#160;remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2&#8208;&#160;(V6&#8208;OH) hybrid metal&#8208;oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein&#8208;bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where&#160;interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) of the V6&#8208;OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective modifications of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species &#160;in presence of ascorbate as a reducing agent. The oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6&#8208;OH to result either in selective oxidation of &#160;side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC&#8208;MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters in protein modification.</dc:description>

Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2-&#160;(V6-OH) hybrid metal-oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein-bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where&#160;interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SC-XRD) of the V6-OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective modifications of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species &#160;in presence of ascorbate as a reducing agent. The oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6-OH to result either in selective oxidation of &#160;side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC-MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal-oxo clusters in protein modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Target&#8208;Templated Construction of Functional Proteomimetics Using Photo&#8208;Foldamer Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expedient generation of functional proteomimetics was achieved without relying on any a&#8197;priori structural hypotheses concerning target binding. A 100&#8208;membered photoreactive local surface mimetic foldamer library mapped the challenging protein targets, yielding the primary hits. From these building blocks, a dynamic covalent selection based affinity amplification was achieved by hit&#8208;ligation.







Abstract
Current methods for proteomimetic engineering rely on structure&#8208;based design. Here we describe a design strategy that allows the construction of proteomimetics against challenging targets without a&#8197;priori characterization of the target surface. Our approach employs (i) a 100&#8208;membered photoreactive foldamer library, the members of which act as local surface mimetics, and (ii) the subsequent affinity maturation of the primary hits using systems chemistry. Two surface&#8208;oriented proteinogenic side chains drove the interactions between the short helical foldamer fragments and the proteins. Diazirine&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking was applied to sensitively detect and localize binding even to shallow and dynamic patches on representatively difficult targets. Photo&#8208;foldamers identified functionally relevant protein interfaces, allosteric and previously unexplored targetable regions on the surface of STAT3 and an oncogenic K&#8208;Ras variant. Target&#8208;templated dynamic linking of foldamer hits resulted in two orders of magnitude affinity improvement in a single step. The dimeric K&#8208;Ras ligand mimicked protein&#8208;like catalytic functions. The photo&#8208;foldamer approach thus enables the highly efficient mapping of protein&#8208;protein interaction sites and provides a viable starting point for proteomimetic ligand development without a&#8197;priori structural hypotheses.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Enables Anions&#8208;Regulated Solvation Structure for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TEG co&#8208;solvent with two&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions&#8208;involved solvation shell, leads to the formation of a bilayer SEI, consisting of carbon&#8208;rich organic outer and ZnF2&#8208;rich inner layer, protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, their practical application is hindered by the excessive use of zinc anodes and poor high&#8208;temperature performance, caused by severe side reactions and dendritic growth issues. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bidentate coordination of Zn2+ and solvent to tailor the solvation structure. The triethylene glycol (TEG) co&#8208;solvent with two&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions&#8208;involved solvation shell, greatly reducing the activity of coordinated H2O molecules. The sequential reduction of OTF&#8722; anions and TEG leads to the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic bilayer SEI (hydrophobic organic layer and high ion conductivity inorganic layer), protecting Zn anodes from side reactions and dendrite growth, thus ensuring an unprecedented Zn reversibility (99.95&#8201;% over 5000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity (2552&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio=15&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.9) and a high areal capacity (3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Photocatalytic Generation by Silanized TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface silanization of TiO2 (P25) with hexadecylsilane (HD) induces changes in the coordination of surface titanium centers and stabilizes Ti3+ defects in the sub&#8208;surface region. These defects could act as photosensitizers for the production of singlet oxygen through F&#246;rster&#8208;type resonance energy transfer (FRET), while interfacial electron transfer is efficiently suppressed.







Abstract
A commercial TiO2 sample, used as received or hydrothermally treated to increase surface hydroxylation, has been functionalized by surface modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane. The anchoring of the silane has been characterized by means of FTIR and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopies, and the grafting density was determined by thermogravimetric and N2 physisorption analyses. The silane moieties induce a partial decrease of the shielding of the valence electrons of the Ti ions at the surface, and a local modification of their crystal field, as demonstrated by XPS and UV/Vis spectroscopy, respectively. The changes in coordination and the produced oxygen vacancies result in the formation of Ti3+ defects localized in the sub&#8208;surface region, as revealed by EPR spectroscopy. These paramagnetic centers are stabilized in the silanized samples, as the electron transfer to O2 is efficiently inhibited even under UV irradiation. However, the amount of Ti3+ centers appears to be correlated with the singlet oxygen (1O2) formation rate. Accordingly, epoxidation of limonene under UV light, chosen as a model photocatalytic reaction triggered by 1O2, occurred with higher selectivity when TiO2 was silanized and upon simultaneous NIR irradiation. These evidences suggest that in the silanized sample 1O2 may be generated through F&#246;rster&#8208;type energy transfer from excited sub&#8208;surface Ti3+ centers.

These paramagnetic centers are stabilized in the silanized samples, as the electron transfer to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is efficiently inhibited even under UV irradiation. However, the amount of Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers appears to be correlated with the singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) formation rate. Accordingly, epoxidation of limonene under UV light, chosen as a model photocatalytic reaction triggered by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, occurred with higher selectivity when TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was silanized and upon simultaneous NIR irradiation. These evidences suggest that in the silanized sample &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be generated through F&#246;rster-type energy transfer from excited sub-surface Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Dynamic Chirality in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a molecular design where the dynamic chirality of donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores is controlled using a configurationally stable chiral unit. Beyond illustrating the potential of dynamic chirality control to facilitate the access to chiral functional materials, this work highlight the positive influence of chiral perturbation from the configurationally stable chiral unit on the dissymmetry factors of the dynamically chiral fluorophores.







Abstract
Recently, the control of dynamic chirality has emerged as a powerful strategy to design chiral functional materials. In this context, we describe herein a molecular design in which a tethered configurationally stable binaphthyl chiral unit efficiently controls the dynamic chirality of donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores, involving diverse indolocarbazoles as electron donors and terephthalonitrile as an electron acceptor. The high conformational discrimination in such a molecular system suggested by density functional theory calculations is experimentally probed using electronic and vibrational circular dichroism and confirmed by the crystallization of these chiral molecules in gel and their single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work also highlights the positive effect of the configurationally stable chiral unit on the magnitude of the dissymmetry factors of the active dynamically chiral fluorophores, both in ground and excited states, through chiral perturbation.

         <title>Moir&#233; Lattice of Twisted Bilayer Graphene as Template for Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

Utilization of the mori&#233; lattice formed by twisted bilayer graphene as template for non&#8208;covalent functionalization with HATCN molecules confirmed by Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree of non&#8208;covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with twist angles varying between ~5&#176; and 7&#176; was non&#8208;covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11&#8208;hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy, where areas with larger twist angles exhibited a lower HATCN peak intensity compared to areas with smaller twist angles. We suggest that the HATCN adsorption follows the moir&#233; pattern of tBLG by avoiding AA&#8208;stacked areas and attach predominantly to areas with a local AB&#8208;stacking order of tBLG, forming an overall ABA&#8208;stacking configuration. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir&#233; lattice in controlling the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials using moir&#233; structures as a template. This could facilitate the fabrication of nanoscale devices with locally controlled varying chemical functionality.

         <title>Selective Glycan Presentation in Liquid&#8208;Ordered or &#8208;Disordered Membrane Phases and its Effect on Lectin Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of sequence&#8208;defined, lipidated glycomimetics was synthesized and incorporated into phase&#8208;separating GUVs to mimic cellular lipid rafts. Depending on the lipid anchor, the glycomimetics partition into either the Lo or Ld domain of the vesicles, enabling the construction of spatially defined glycocalyx models. Moreover, ligands in the Lo domain were shown to engage more effectively in lectin recruitment than those in the Ld domain.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;protein interactions play a key role in various biological processes from fertilization to infections. Many of these interactions take place at the glycocalyx&#8212;a heavily glycosylated layer at the cell surface. Despite its significance, studying the glycocalyx remains challenging due to its complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature. This study introduces a glycocalyx model allowing for the first time to control spatial organization and heterogeneity of the glycan moieties. Glycan&#8208;mimetics with lipid&#8208;moieties that partition into either liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo, lipid rafts) or liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phases of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which serve as simplified cell membrane models mimicking lipid rafts, are developed. This phase&#8208;specific allocation allows controlled placement of glycan motifs in distinct membrane environments, creating heteromultivalent systems that replicate the natural glycocalyx's complexity. We show that phase localization of glycan mimetics significantly influences recruitment of protein receptors to the membrane. Glycan&#8208;conjugates in the ordered phase demonstrate enhanced lectin binding, supporting the idea that raft&#8208;like domains facilitate stronger receptor interactions. This study provides a platform for systematically investigating spatial and dynamic presentation of glycans in biological systems and presents the first experimental evidence that glycan accumulation in lipid rafts enhances receptor binding affinity, offering deeper insights into the glycocalyx&#8216;s functional mechanisms.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Hydration of Phosphoenolpyruvate: General Conditions for Hydration in Protometabolism by Searching Across Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a novel search strategy, we identified common mild nonenzymatic conditions for all hydration reactions in gluconeogenesis and the rTCA cycle and for the retro&#8208;aldol cleavage of citrate, advancing the search for an environment conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.







Abstract
Numerous reactions within metabolic pathways have been reported to occur nonenzymatically, supporting the hypothesis that life arose upon a primitive nonenzymatic precursor to metabolism. However, most of those studies reproduce individual transformations or segments of pathways without providing a common set of conditions for classes of reactions that span multiple pathways. In this study, we search across pathways for common nonenzymatic conditions for a recurring chemical transformation in metabolism: alkene hydration. The mild conditions that we identify (Fe oxides such as green rust) apply to all hydration reactions of the rTCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, including the hydration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 2&#8208;phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which had not previously been reported under nonenzymatic conditions. Mechanistic insights were obtained by studying analogous substrates and through anoxic and radical trapping experiments. Searching for nonenzymatic conditions across pathways provides a complementary strategy to triangulate conditions conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.

         <title>Property Prediction of Bio&#8208;Derived Block Copolymer Thermoplastic Elastomers Using Graph Kernel Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	These authors contributed equally to the work.PolyAGM, which stands for Polymer Property Prediction based on the Automatic Generation of Motifs, is presented as an addition to the Machine Learning Toolkit. It connects graph kernel methods to fingerprinting strategies to predict both thermal and mechanical properties for ABA&#8208;type block copolymers. The approach focuses on degradable and/or recyclable polycarbonate and polyester chemistries sourced mainly from bio&#8208;derivable monomers with the goal of advancing sustainable polymer development as alternatives to commercial plastics. The key parameters of polymer chain length, stereochemistry, and A&#8208;to&#8208;B block ratio are represented in graphs composed of nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds). By searching these graphs for significant motifs or chemical substructures, the algorithm allows property predictions and structure&#8208;property correlations beyond the chemical structure of monomer repeating units. Beyond the thermoplastic elastomers considered here as an important subset of commercial polymers in need of being more sustainably sourced and offering better end&#8208;of&#8208;life options, PolyAGM is expected to have broad applicability as efforts continue to expand the database of oxygen&#8208;rich polymers.







Abstract
Increasing the diversity of bio&#8208;based polymers is needed to address the combined problems of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the problems necessitates rapid discovery of new materials; however, identification of appropriate chemistries maybe slow using current iterative methods. Machine learning (ML) methods could significantly expedite new material discovery and property identification. Here, PolyAGM, a ML algorithm using graph kernel methods, is introduced and used to predict the properties of block copolymers and identify the responsible structural &#8216;motifs&#8217;. It applies a &#8220;fingerprinting&#8221; method to convert Graph representations of polymers into numerical vectors. The Graphs explicitly encode the entire copolymer of atoms and bonds such that the sequencing of chemical features and polymer chain length are included, alongside relevant stereochemical information. PolyAGM gives predictions for both thermal and mechanical properties that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. This work focuses on predicting the properties of bio&#8208;derived ABA&#8208;block polymer thermoplastic elastomers, but the general fingerprinting technique of PolyAGM should be relevant to other application fields.

&lt;p&gt;[+]	These authors contributed equally to the work.PolyAGM, which stands for Polymer Property Prediction based on the Automatic Generation of Motifs, is presented as an addition to the Machine Learning Toolkit. It connects graph kernel methods to fingerprinting strategies to predict both thermal and mechanical properties for ABA-type block copolymers. The approach focuses on degradable and/or recyclable polycarbonate and polyester chemistries sourced mainly from bio-derivable monomers with the goal of advancing sustainable polymer development as alternatives to commercial plastics. The key parameters of polymer chain length, stereochemistry, and A-to-B block ratio are represented in graphs composed of nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds). By searching these graphs for significant motifs or chemical substructures, the algorithm allows property predictions and structure-property correlations beyond the chemical structure of monomer repeating units. Beyond the thermoplastic elastomers considered here as an important subset of commercial polymers in need of being more sustainably sourced and offering better end-of-life options, PolyAGM is expected to have broad applicability as efforts continue to expand the database of oxygen-rich polymers.

         <title>Machine Learning Assisted Prediction of Donor Numbers: Guiding Rational Fabrication of Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prediction model for donor number (DN) was developed using machine&#8208;learning techniques, while the electron&#8208;donating ability of polymer segments to regulate the Li+ solvation structure was revealed and verified. Furthermore, a high&#8208;DN zwitterionic polymer electrolyte was designed to facilitate rapid Li+ transportation and ensure stable long&#8208;term high&#8208;voltage cyclability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes are of interest in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, how the intrinsic electron&#8208;donating capability of polymer segments involved in coordination affects lithium&#8208;ion dissociation/transmission and rationally guides the design and fabrication of electrolytes is a highly exploratory topic. This study proposes a workable method that integrates machine learning with density functional theory to predict donor numbers (DN) for polymer building units. Using this approach, polymer chains with optimized DN are designed, effectively modulating the solvation structure of lithium&#8208;ion. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the positive impact of polymer chains on rapid transport of lithium ions. Experimental validation of the proposed zwitterionic polymer electrolyte (ZPE) showcases satisfactory parameters: ion conductivity (0.59&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), ion migration numbers (0.82), and activation energy (0.016&#8197;eV). Electrochemical analysis on Li|ZPE|Li symmetric batteries demonstrate sustained plating/stripping performance exceeding 3000&#8197;hours at a current density of 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Assembled NCM|ZPE|Li batteries exhibit stable cycling over 1400 cycles at 4.3&#8197;V, with a capacity retention ratio of 92.3&#8201;%. Moreover, even under ultra&#8208;high voltages of 4.5&#8197;V and 4.7&#8197;V, NCM|ZPE|Li batteries display stable cycling performances. This approach offers a paradigmatic strategy for polymer molecule design, advancing sustainable battery technologies.

         <title>The Kinetics of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in Metazoan Fatty Acid Synthase and Its Impact on Product Fidelity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of metazoan fatty acid synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of an acyl and malonyl substrate with two cooperatively working subunits. The KS ensures the fidelity of the fatty acid biosynthesis i) by increasing the speed with substrate length and ii) by discriminating against the intermediates of the fatty acid cycle.







Abstract
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) multienzymes are responsible for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and crucial in primary metabolism. Despite extensive research, the molecular details of the FAS catalytic mechanisms are still poorly understood. For example, the &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) catalyzes the fatty acid elongating carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;bond formation, which is the key catalytic step in biosynthesis, but factors that determine the speed and accuracy of his reaction are still unclear. Here, we report enzyme kinetics of the KS&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, enabled by a continuous fluorometric activity assay. We observe that the KS is likely rate&#8208;limiting to the fatty acid biosynthesis, its kinetics are adapted to the length of the bound fatty acyl chain, and that the KS is also responsible for the fidelity of biosynthesis by preventing intermediates from undergoing KS&#8208;mediated elongation. To provide mechanistic insight into KS selectivity, we performed computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identify positive cooperativity of the KS dimer, which we suggest to affect the conformational variability of the multienzyme. Advancing our knowledge about the KS molecular mechanism will pave the ground for engineering FAS for biotechnology applications and the design of new therapeutics targeting the fatty acid metabolism.

         <dc:description>
Three three&#8208;phase interfacial reactions in electrochemical reduction of stacked GO membranes were found. Based on the finding, a method using a simple three&#8208;electrode device in combination with real&#8208;time imaging of the membrane surface for identifying and quantifying through&#8208;plane proton transport channels in stacked GO membranes is proposed.







Abstract
Stacked graphene oxide (GO) proton membranes are promising candidates for use in energy devices due to their proton conductivity. Identification of through&#8208;plane channels in these membranes is critical but challenging due to their anisotropic nature. Here, we present an electrochemical reduction method for identifying and quantifying through&#8208;plane proton channels in GO membranes. The simplicity lies in the operando optical observation of the change in contrast as GO is electrochemically reduced. Here, we find three proton&#8208;dominated three&#8208;phase interfaces, which are critical for the reduction reactions of GO membranes. Based on these findings, a method is proposed to identify and quantify through&#8208;plane channels in stacked GO proton membranes using a simple three&#8208;electrode device in combination with real&#8208;time imaging of the membrane surface.

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>

         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) has been used to reveal pressure&#8208;induced phase transformations in pharmaceutical tablets of glycolide as a function of compaction pressure. Temporal analysis of the tablets, and subsequent identification using electron diffraction, revealed a hydrolysis reaction occurred on storage of the tablets. This reaction was enhanced in the presence of microcrystalline cellulose.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.

         <title>On&#8208;Site Portable Lithium Detection in Mining and Recycling Industries Based on a DNAzyme Fluorescent Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications of a DNAzyme sensor have been developed for the on&#8208;site detection of lithium in the lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) industry. Simple methods to detect lithium in brine and rock mining applications, and in LIB recycling applications, have been designed and successfully implemented using the highly selective lithium DNAzyme sensor and portable fluorometers.







Abstract
The global demand for lithium has soared in recent years due to the wide use of lithium batteries. To meet this demand, we herein report developing novel on&#8208;site sample preparation methods for the extraction of Li+ from relevant materials, including brine water, spodumene rock, as well as lithium&#8208;ion battery electrodes, and a DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent sensor for sensitive and robust detection of Li+ in these samples down to 1.4&#8197;mM (10&#8197;ppm) using a portable fluorometer. The system can distinguish key threshold lithium levels that indicate economic value across several industries, including 200&#8197;ppm Li+ for brine mining, 6&#8201;% Li2O or SC6 for rock mining, and Li+&#8208;specific aging in LIBs. The methods developed and demonstrated in this work will allow highly selective, on&#8208;site, portable detection of lithium in both environmental samples to identify new lithium resources and in battery electrodes to guide recycling strategies in order to meet the global demand for lithium.

         <title>Intratumoral Transforming Boron Nanosensitizers for Amplified Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel smart boron nanosensitizer (BATBN) is comprised of ultrasmall boron quantum dots (BQDs) conjugated with cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, which facilitates its cellular uptake and deep tumor penetration. A self&#8208;condensation reaction of BATBN triggered by the tumor biomarker, leading to the formation of larger&#8208;sized nanoaggregates, presents a supramolecular strategy which enables precise and efficient boron neutron capture therapy (BCNT) for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an advanced binary tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selected heavy&#8208;particle radiotherapy used for treating invasive malignant tumors. However, its clinical applications have been impeded by the rapid metabolism and insufficient tumor&#8208;specific accumulation of boron agents. To tackle this issue, we develop a smart boron nanosensitizer (BATBN) capable of transforming its size in response to cancer biomarker for optimal balance between penetration and retention of boron&#8208;10 for BNCT. BATBN comprises an ultrasmall boron quantum dots (BQD) core (4&#8197;nm) conjugated with cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, which facilitates its cellular uptake and deep tumor penetration. In the tumor microenvironment, the tumor biomarker can specifically initiate a self&#8208;condensation reaction of BATBN, leading to the formation of larger&#8208;sized nanoaggregates. Due to such a specific intratumoral transformation, BATBN demonstrates a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in intratumoral boron concentration and a 5.0&#8208;fold increase in tumor retention time compared to the BQDs. Thus, the tumor volume of the BATBNs&#8208;treatment group is 2.7&#8208;fold smaller than that of BQDs in preclinical tumor models after 21&#8197;days of neutron irradiation treatment. This study presents a supramolecular strategy to endow BNCT agents with the biomarker&#8208;activated size interconversion, permitting precise and efficient BNCT for cancer treatment.

Schematic illustration of FeMn for simultaneously activating both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to maximize the utilization of various substituents of native lignin reforming into syngas over InGaN nanowires.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. The cocatalyst, integrated with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8&#8201;%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896&#8197;mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies, thus promising to maximally utilize different substituents of &#8722;OCH3, and &#8722;CH2CH2CH3 in lignin for syngas production. Moreover, the dual Fe&#8208;Mn cocatalyst demonstrates a most energetically favorable route for the consecutive release of hydrogen from &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OH by the oxidative holes while inhibiting the reversion of hydrogen and hydroxyl into water.

         <title>Allosteric CDC37 Inhibitor Disrupts Chaperone Complex to Block CDK4/6 Maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

Allosterically targeting CDC37 by small molecule inhibitor DDO&#8208;6079 disrupts protein&#8208;protein interaction of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6, thus to decrease thermal stability of CDK6 and reverse drug resistance of CDK4/6 inhibitors without HSR.







Abstract
Cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) is a member of the molecular chaperone family and acts as a cochaperone of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is overexpressed in many cancer types as a regulator of protein kinase maturation. In this process, CDC37 selectively recognizes and stabilizes protein kinases by forming a HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex. The protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;kinase complexes contribute to malignant tumors, as oncogenic kinases in malignant cells depend upon CDC37 expression. Thus, inhibiting CDC37 to disrupt HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex reveals as a promising way to achieve selective inhibition of oncogenic kinase maturation. Herein, we report a small&#8208;molecule CDC37 inhibitor called DDO&#8208;6079 that simultaneously inhibits HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6 chaperone complex by binding to an allosteric site on CDC37. DDO&#8208;6079 selectively inhibited the maturation of multiple oncogenic kinases to escape heat shock response (HSR). Furthermore, DDO&#8208;6079 decreased the thermostability of CDK6, reversed the resistance of CDK6 to palbociclib (a successful CDK4/6 inhibitor) in colorectal cancer cells and exhibited efficacy in vivo. Together, the results revealed that DDO&#8208;6079 is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule CDC37 inhibitor that disrupts the HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex and provides a new way to block kinase maturation.

We report an approach to functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) through the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of allylated cyclopropanes. Cyclopropane activation is achieved through direct photoexcitation of an appended imine. Activated and unactivated alkenes are tolerated in the reaction.







Abstract
We report a synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via an intramolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition of allylated cyclopropanes bearing a 4&#8208;nitrobenzimine substituent. Both activated and unactivated alkenes are tolerated in the transformation. The bicyclic imine products are prone to photo&#8208;induced ring opening, allowing for the epimerization of C5&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Unusual Cross&#8208;Conjugation in Cyclic Dipeptide&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Donor&#8211;Acceptor Semiconducting Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross conjugation is typically less effective for electron delocalization and thus rarely used in semiconducting polymers. We developed TIDP, a novel building block featuring a cyclic dipeptide with backbone cross conjugation. TIDP showed a rigid, coplanar conformation with well&#8208;delocalized &#960; electrons. Polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Cross conjugation, though prevalent in many organic compounds, is typically considered less effective for electron delocalization compared to linear conjugation. Consequently, it is rarely used as the backbone structure for semiconducting conjugated polymers. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel building block, TIDP, which features a central cyclic dipeptide with cross conjugation characteristics. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions confer TIDP with a highly rigid and coplanar conformation. Importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that &#960; electrons are well delocalized across the entire structure, despite its low aromaticity. Conjugated polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating the effective &#960; electrons delocalization of this innovative building block. Our findings show that with rational design, cross conjugation can achieve effective &#960; electrons delocalization, providing a valuable approach for developing high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers for organic electronic materials.

         <title>Design of Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for High&#8208;Sensitivity Flexible All&#8208;Polymer Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;band gap polymer acceptors were synthesized for construction of all&#8208;polymer short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. The all&#8208;polymer photodetectors achieved a high specific detectivity (D*sh) over 1013 Jones from 610 (visible) to 1080&#8197;nm (SWIR) under zero bias. The all&#8208;polymer flexibe photodetectors were successfully applied in heart rate monitoring, optical communication and SWIR imaging.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer photodetectors possess unique mechanical flexibility and are ideally suitable for the application in next&#8208;generation flexible, wearable short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;2700&#8197;nm) photodetectors. However, all&#8208;polymer photodetectors commonly suffer from low sensitivity, high noise, and low photoresponse speed in the SWIR region, which significantly diminish their application potential in wearable electronics. Herein, two polymer acceptors with absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm, namely P4TOC&#8208;DCBT and P4TOC&#8208;DCBSe, were designed and synthesized. The two polymers possess rigid structure and good conformational stability, which is beneficial for reducing energetic disorder and suppressing dark current. Owing to the efficient charge generation and ultralow noise current, the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer photodetector achieved a specific detectivity (

) of over 1012 Jones from 650 (visible) to 1070&#8197;nm (SWIR) under zero bias, with a response time of 1.36&#8197;&#956;s. These are the best results for reported all&#8208;polymer SWIR photodetectors in photovoltaic mode. More significantly, the all&#8208;polymer blend films exhibit good mechanical durability, and hence the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based flexible all&#8208;polymer photodetectors show a small performance attenuation (&lt;4&#8201;%) after 2000&#8197;cycles of bending to a 3&#8197;mm radius. The all&#8208;polymer flexible SWIR organic photodetectors are successfully applied in pulse signal detection, optical communication and image capture.

         <title>Engineering &#960;&#8208;Electron Bridge Enables Low&#8208;Potential 2D Redox Polymer Anodes for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous All&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#960;&#8208;electron bridge engineering strategy is introduced to explore a class of dioxin&#8208;bridged 2D redox polymer (D&#8208;HATN) capable of acting as a low&#8208;potential organic anode with diverse ion compatibility for high&#8208;voltage aqueous all&#8208;organic batteries. Detailed theoretical studies for the first time reveal the crucial effect of the &#960;&#8208;electron bridge between redox sites on the electrode potential and redox activity of 2D redox polymer anodes.







Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;organic batteries (AAOBs) have emerged as a hot topic but their development was plagued by limited choices of anode materials, generally facing an intractable trade&#8208;off between low potential and high stability. Here, we propose a novel &#960;&#8208;electron bridge engineering strategy to explore a class of 2D dioxin&#8208;bridged redox covalent organic polymer (RCOP) as trade&#8208;off&#8208;breaking anodes for high&#8208;voltage AAOBs. By establishing a tunable RCOP platform, we perform theoretical study to scrutinize how bridge units between active sites affect the electrode potential and redox activity for the first time. We discover that compared to common pyrazine bridge, the weakened conjugation and strong electron donor character of the proposed dioxin bridge can induce elevated LUMO level and enriched &#960;&#8208;electron populations in active sites, heralding a low electrode potential and enhanced redox activity. Besides, the nonaromaticity&#8208;induced molecular flexibility of dioxin bridge mitigates intermolecular stacking for sufficient active sites exposure. To experimentally corroborate this, a new dioxin&#8208;bridged 2D RCOP (D&#8208;HATN) and its pyrazine&#8208;bridged analogue (P&#8208;HATN) are synthesized for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration. D&#8208;HATN displays excellent compatibility with Na+/Zn2+/NH4+/H3O+ and obviously lower redox potentials in various dilute electrolytes compared to P&#8208;HATN and most reported organic anodes, while featuring rapid Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction and unprecedented durability in acid &#8211; 91.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 20000 cycles. Thus, the D&#8208;HATN&#8208;involved all&#8208;organic proton battery delivers an average output voltage of 0.75&#8197;V, which can be further elevated to 1.63&#8197;V with alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid electrolyte design, affording markedly&#8208;increased specific energy.

         <title>Solution&#8208;processing induced H&#8208;aggregate of Perylene&#8208;Diimide Zwitterion Exhibiting Compact Molecular Stacking toward Efficient Cathode Modification in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;diimide zwitterion PDI&#8208;B was designed and synthesized as a universal cathode interlayer material, enabling diverse applications in efficient OSCs. With the assistance of solution&#8208;processing, PDI&#8208;B tended to form H&#8208;aggregate and possessed tight molecular packing in the film, which significantly facilitates the electron transport of OSCs.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic cathode interlayers (CILs) play a crucial role in the advance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, organic CILs have exhibited inferior performances to their inorganic counterparts over a long time, due to the inherent shortcoming of poor charge transporting capability. Here, we designed and synthesized a perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) zwitterion PDI&#8208;B as high&#8208;performance organic CIL for OSCs. We revealed that an obvious H&#8208;aggregate of PDI&#8208;B was formed during the solution processing, thereby significantly enhancing the charge transporting capability of the CIL.

&lt;p&gt;A perylene-diimide zwitterion PDI-B was designed and synthesized as a universal cathode interlayer material, enabling diverse applications in efficient OSCs. With the assistance of solution-processing, PDI-B tended to form H-aggregate and possessed tight molecular packing in the film, which significantly facilitates the electron transport of OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance organic cathode interlayers (CILs) play a crucial role in the advance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, organic CILs have exhibited inferior performances to their inorganic counterparts over a long time, due to the inherent shortcoming of poor charge transporting capability. Here, we designed and synthesized a perylene-diimide (PDI) zwitterion PDI-B as high-performance organic CIL for OSCs. We revealed that an obvious H-aggregate of PDI-B was formed during the solution processing, thereby significantly enhancing the charge transporting capability of the CIL. Compared to the classic PDINN, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance of PDI-B was reduced from 4.2&#8197;&#197; to 3.9&#8197;&#197;, which further facilitated the charge transport. Consequently, PDI-B showed a high conductivity of 1.81&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;S/m; this is comparable to that of inorganic CILs. The binary OSC showed an elevated PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is among the highest PCE values for binary OSCs. Benefitting from improved solvent resistance and good compatibility with large-area processing method of PDI-B, the photovoltaic performances of inverted and 1-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; OSC were significantly improved. The results from this work provide a new approach of optimizing the condensed structure of PDI film to boost the charge conductivity, opening an avenue to develop high-performance PDI-based CILs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Solvent Free DLP 3D Printing of Degradable Poly(Allyl Glycidyl Ether Succinate)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester by ring opening copolymerization and its use in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin yielding 3D printed parts with minimal shrinkage and residual stress.







Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) printing forms solid constructs from fluidic resins by photochemically crosslinking polymeric resins with reactive functional groups. DLP is used widely due to its efficient, high&#8208;resolution printing, but its use and translational potential has been limited in some applications as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resins experience unpredictable and anisotropic part shrinkage due to the use of solvent needed to reduce resin viscosity and layer dependent crosslinking. Herein, poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester, was synthesized by ring opening copolymerization and used in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin that can be utilized in DLP printing. Varying resin formulations of PAGES polymer are shown to decrease part shrinkage from 14&#8201;% to 0.3&#8201;%. Photochemically printed parts fabricated from PAGES possess tensile moduli between 0.43 and 6.18&#8197;MPa and degradation profiles are shown to vary between 12 and 40&#8197;days under accelerated conditions based on degree of polymerization and crosslink ratio.

Guided by reticular chemistry, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy to construct full&#8208;color emissive LMOFs via the single&#8208;site modification between the reaction of various aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs can be utilized as chemical sensors and excellent platforms to investigate energy transfer.







Abstract
Organic linker&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive studies due to the unlimited species of emissive organic linkers and tunable structure of MOFs. However, the multiple&#8208;step organic synthesis is always a great challenge for the development of LMOFs. As an alternative strategy, in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy, in which the generation of emissive organic linkers and sequential construction of LMOFs happen in one reaction condition, can avoid time&#8208;consuming pre&#8208;synthesis of organic linkers. In the present work, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy to construct a series of LMOFs via the single&#8208;site modification between the reaction of aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs possess csq topology with emission covering blue to near&#8208;infrared. The nanosized LMOFs exhibit excellent sensitivity and selectivity for tryptophan detection. In addition, two component&#8208;based LMOFs can also be prepared via the in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy and used to study energy transfer. This work not only reports the construction of LMOFs with full&#8208;color emissions, which can be utilized for various applications, but also indicates that in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy indeed is a useful and powerful method to complement the traditional MOFs construction method for preparing porous materials with tunable functionalities and properties.

         <title>L&#8211;Cysteine&#8208;Catalysed Hydration of Activated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine catalyses water addition to activated alkynes, yielding important building blocks in synthetic chemistry such as &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, providing an alternative to metal catalysts. The mild reaction conditions allowed the integration with enzyme catalysis to access a chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy sulfone in high enantiomeric ratio.







Abstract
Hydration reactions consist of the introduction of a molecule of water into a chemical compound and are particularly useful to transform alkynes into carbonyls, which are strategic intermediates in the synthesis of a plethora of compounds. Herein we demonstrate that L&#8211;cysteine can catalyse the hydration of activated alkynes in a very effective and fully regioselective manner to access important building blocks in synthetic chemistry such as &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones, amides and esters, in aqueous media. The mild reaction conditions facilitated the integration with enzyme catalysis to access chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy sulfones from the corresponding alkynes in a one&#8208;pot cascade process in good yields and excellent enantiomeric ratios. These findings pave the way towards establishing a general method for metal&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and more sustainable alkyne hydration processes.

         <title>&#8216;Invisible&#8217; Molecular Dynamics Revealed for a Conformationally Chiral &#960;&#8208;Stacked Perylene Bisimide Foldamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interconversion of perylene bisimide (PBI) foldamer via an open meta&#8208;stable state into stereoisomers is normally &#8216;invisible&#8217; under equilibrium. We designed a kinetically trapped out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conformationally chiral PBI folda&#8208;dimer and used UV/Vis, NMR, CD and CPL spectroscopy to observe the opening and re&#8208;folding processes.







Abstract
Whilst energetic and kinetic aspects of folding processes are meanwhile well understood for natural biomacromolecules, the folding dynamics in so far studied artificial foldamer counterparts remain largely unexplored. This is due to the low energy barriers between their conformational isomers that make the dynamic processes undetectable with conventional methods such as UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy, making such processes &#8216;invisible&#8217;. Here we present an asymmetric perylene bisimide dimer (bis&#8208;PBI&#160;1) that possesses conformational chirality in its folded state. Owing to the large interconversion barrier (&#8805;116&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), four stereoisomers could be separated and isolated. Since the interconversion between these stereoisomers requires the foldamer to first open and then to re&#8208;fold, the transformation of one stereoisomer into others allowed us to &#8216;visualize&#8217; the dynamics of folding with time and determine its lifetimes and the energetic barriers associated with the folding process. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, we identified the open structure to be only a fleetingly metastable state of higher energy. Our experimental observation of the kinetics associated with the molecular dynamics in the PBI foldamer advances the fundamental understanding of folding in synthetic foldamers and paves the way for the design of smart functional materials.

Our experimental observation of the kinetics associated with the molecular dynamics in the PBI foldamer advances the fundamental understanding of folding in synthetic foldamers and paves the way for the design of smart functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Enrichment of Free Radicals through Nanoconfinement Boosts Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Dots Derived from Luminol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This electrochemiluminescence system aims to catalytically increase the local radical concentration by enriching co&#8208;reactants on the electrode surface within specific domains, named nanoconfinement&#8208;reactor, a novel sensing mechanism with potential for practical bioanalytical applications.







Abstract
Local enrichment of free radicals at the electrode interface may open new opportunities for the development of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) applications. The sensing platform was constructed by assembling ECL&#8208;emitting luminol derived carbon dots (Lu CDs) onto the heterojunction Tungsten disulfide/Covalent organic frameworks (WS2@COF) for the first time, establishing a nanoconfinement&#8208;reactor with significantly heightened ECL intensity and stability compared to the Lu CDs&#8208;H2O2 system. This enhanced performance is credited to the COF domain&#8216;s restricted pore environment, where WS2@COF exhibits a more negative adsorption energy for H2O2, effectively enriching H2O2 in the catalytic edge sites of WS2. Furthermore, the internal electric field at the WS2 and COF interface accelerates electron flow, boosting WS2&#8242;s catalytic activity and achieving domain&#8208;limited catalytic enhancement of ECL. Self&#8208;designed DNA nanomachines combined with cascading molecular keypad locking mechanisms are integrated into the biosensors, effectively guaranteeing the accuracy of the sensing process while providing crucial safeguards for molecular diagnostics and information security applications. In essence, this innovative approach represents the first system to enhance local free radical concentrations by enriching co&#8208;reactants on the electrode surface through nanoconfinement catalysis, yielding heightened ECL intensity. The potential impact of this novel strategy and sensing mechanism on real&#8208;bioanalysis applications is promising.

         <title>Catalytic Edges in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with various catalytic edges (carbonyl group, diaminopyrazine, phenylimidazole, and benzaldehyde imidazole) have been demonstrated to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction. The carbon atoms in phenylimidazole facilitated the formation of OOH*, thus showing higher activity than other COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) because of their diverse structural units and controllable catalytic sites, and the edge sites have high catalytic activity than the basal sites. However, it is still challenge to modulate the edge sites in COFs, because the extended frameworks in two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional topologies resulted in limited edge parts. In this study, we have demonstrated the edge site modulation engineering based on one dimensional (1D) COFs to catalyze the ORR, which featured distinct edge groups&#8208;carbonyl, diaminopyrazine, phenylimidazole, and benzaldehyde imidazole units. The synthesized COFs have same ordered frameworks, similar pore structure, but had different electronic states of the carbons along the edge sites, which results in tailored catalytic properties. Notably, the COF functionalized with a phenylimidazole edge group exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the other synthesized COFs. And the theoretical calculation further revealed the different edge sites had tunable binding ability of the intermediates OOH*, which contributed modulated activity. Our findings introduce a novel way for designing COFs optimized for ORR applications through molecular level control of edge sites.

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helicates as Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Substrates with High Tailorability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates were synthesized and proven effective as substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) through systematic optimization of ligands and metals, achieving substantial Raman enhancement and highlighting their potential to advance SERS substrate innovation.







Abstract
The exploration of novel functionalized supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) can enable new applications in domains that include purification and sensing. In this study, employing a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, we designed and prepared a series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates as high&#8208;efficiency charge&#8208;transfer surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, expanding the range of applications for these metallohelicates. Through structural modifications, including the substitution of single heteroatoms on ligands, replacement of coordinating metals, and alteration of ligand framework linkages, the Raman performance of these metallohelicates as substrates were systematically optimized. Notably, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the metallohelicate&#8208;based SERS substrates were significantly enhanced to levels as high as 1.03&#215;107, which rivals the EFs of noble metals devoid of &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. Additionally, the underlying Raman enhancement mechanisms of these metallohelicates have been investigated through a combination of control experiments and theoretical calculations. This study not only demonstrates the utility of metallohelicates as SERS substrates but also offers insights and materials for the development of high&#8208;efficiency new charge&#8208;transfer SERS substrates.

         <title>Single Exposed Zn (0002) Plane and Sustainable Zn&#8208;Oriented Growth Achieving Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;deposited Cu3(C6O6)2 film on brass foil shows a low lattice mismatch (4.24&#8201;%) with electroplating Zn layer, promoting the exposure of a single Zn (0002) plane. The low desolvation energy (&#8722;1.36&#8197;eV) between solvated Zn ions and ordered porous Cu3(C6O6)2 film enables Zn&#8208;oriented nucleation along the (0002) plane, achieving durable epitaxial growth for highly reversible Zn anode.







Abstract
To prevent dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, directional epitaxial growth of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode, especially along the lowest&#8208;surface&#8208;energy Zn (0002) plane, is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, designing single Zn (0002) exposed anodes for sustained uniaxial crystalline orientation of Zn electroplating faces challenges. Herein, we propose an anode engineering that utilizes a low lattice mismatch substrate and ordered Zn2+ migration channels to modify Zn anodes with single (0002) surface exposure and sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented growth, yielding highly reversible ZMBs. A vapor&#8208;deposited metal&#8211;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 film on brass foil shows low lattice mismatch (4.24&#8201;%) with electrodeposited Zn anodes, enabling the exposure of a single (0002) plane. Furthermore, the low desolvation energy (&#8722;1.36&#8197;eV) between solvated Zn2+ ions and the ordered porous Cu3(C6O6)2 film guides sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented nucleation along the Zn (0002) surface. Consequently, the Zn||Zn cells with brass&#8208;Cu3(C6O6)2 substrate shows a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55&#8201;% after 4,000 cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new window to design highly reversible Zn metal anode with a single&#8208;exposed Zn (0002) plane and sustainable oriented growth for emerging ZMBs.

         <title>Cyclic Multi&#8208;Site Chelation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis base 2D covalent organic frameworks, TFT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF are applied to mitigate energetic mismatches and introduce effective n&#8208;type surface energetics and band bending via cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions. Such a multi&#8208;site chelation effect enables a high efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) and excellent stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and moisture&#8208;induced degradation significantly impede the development of highly efficient and stable inverted (p&#8211;i&#8211;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which require high&#8208;quality perovskite bulk. In this research, we mitigate these challenges by integrating thermally stable perovskite layers with Lewis base covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The ordered pore structure and surface binding groups of COFs facilitate cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions, enhancing the perovskite quality across both its bulk and grain boundaries. This process not only reduces defects but also promotes improved energy alignment through n&#8208;type doping at the surface. The inclusion of COF dopants in p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices achieves power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) for a 0.0748&#8208;cm2 device and 23.49&#8201;% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device. Remarkably, these devices retain 81&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 978&#8197;hours of accelerated aging at 85&#176;C, demonstrating remarkable durability. Additionally, COF&#8208;doped devices demonstrate excellent stability under illumination and in moist conditions, even without encapsulation.

         <title>Coupling Manipulation of Interfacial Chemistry and Coordination Structure in Vanadium Oxides Enables Rapid Magnesium Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed to synergistically manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8722;V2O5) for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. The specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8722;V2O5 helps to establish the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion. In addition, the straightened V&#8722;O structure in L&#8722;V2O5 provides fast Mg2+ diffusion path for developing high&#8208;kinetics magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are a highly promising energy storage system due to their high volumetric capacity and intrinsic safety. However, the practical development of RMBs is hindered by the sluggish Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, including at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and within the cathode bulk. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8722;V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8722;V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8722;F/C&#8722;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V&#8722;O structure in L&#8722;V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode. As a result, the L&#8722;V2O5 delivers a high reversible capacity (355.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an excellent rate capability (161&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Impressively, the interdigital micro&#8208;RMBs is firstly assembled, exhibiting excellent flexibility and practicability. This work gives deeper insights into the interface and interior ions diffusion for developing high&#8208;kinetics RMBs.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Molecules for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

Our study shows that the introduced EWMs can improve perovskite device performance by enhancing chemical passivation and interface dipole effect, as well as chemical binding to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. After optimization, devices modified with F4TCNQ achieved a remarkable 25.21&#8201;% efficiency and displayed long&#8208;term stability. Additionally, large&#8208;scale devices (14.0&#8197;cm2) using this approach achieved a high 21.4&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules (EWMs) have exhibited remarkable efficacy in boosting the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the underneath mechanisms governing their positive attributes remain inadequately understood. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive study on EWMs by comparing 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene) bismalononitrile (TCNQ) and (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F4TCNQ) employed at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces. Our findings reveal that EWMs simultaneously enhance chemical passivation, interface dipole effect, and chemically binding of the perovskite to the HTL. Notably, F4TCNQ, with its superior electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, demonstrates a more pronounced impact. Consequently, PCSs modified with F4TCNQ achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21&#8201;%, while demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the PCE of a larger&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0&#8197;cm2) based on F4TCNQ reached 21.41&#8201;%. This work illuminates the multifaceted mechanisms of EWMs at the interfaces in PSCs, delivering pivotal insights that pave the way for the sophisticated design and strategic application of EWMs, thereby propelling the advancement of perovskite photovoltaic technology.

         <title>C60 Fullerene&#8208;Induced Reduction of Metal Ions: Synthesis of C60&#8208;Metal Cluster Heterostructures with High Electrocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, fullerene C60 induces spontaneous reduction of metal ions and deposition of metal clusters, achieving the synthesis of fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts through a pretreatment&#8208;free and reductant&#8208;free process. The strong multiple anchoring points on the surface of C60 promote the stabilization and small size distribution of metal clusters.







Abstract
Metal clusters, due to their small dimensions, contain a high proportion of surface atoms, thus possessing a significantly improved catalytic activity compared with their bulk counterparts and nanoparticles. Defective and modified carbon supports are effective in stabilizing metal clusters, however, the synthesis of isolated metal clusters still requires multiple steps and harsh conditions. Herein, we develop a C60 fullerene&#8208;driven spontaneous metal deposition process, where C60 serves as both a reductant and an anchor, to achieve uniform metal (Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) clusters without the need for any defects or functional groups on C60. Density functional theory calculations reveal that C60 possesses multiple strong metal adsorption sites, which favors stable and uniform deposition of metal atoms. In addition, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of C60, the electronic structures of metal clusters are effectively regulated, not only optimizing the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates but also accelerating the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Ru/C60&#8208;300 exhibits remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution in an alkaline condition. This study demonstrates a facile and efficient method for synthesizing effective fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts without any pretreatment and additional reducing agent.

Herein, we develop a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene-driven spontaneous metal deposition process, where C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; serves as both a reductant and an anchor, to achieve uniform metal (Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) clusters without the need for any defects or functional groups on C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. Density functional theory calculations reveal that C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; possesses multiple strong metal adsorption sites, which favors stable and uniform deposition of metal atoms. In addition, owing to the electron-withdrawing properties of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, the electronic structures of metal clusters are effectively regulated, not only optimizing the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates but also accelerating the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Ru/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-300 exhibits remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution in an alkaline condition. This study demonstrates a facile and efficient method for synthesizing effective fullerene-supported metal cluster catalysts without any pretreatment and additional reducing agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of the Esterase PestE for Amide Bond Synthesis Under Aqueous Conditions: Enzyme Cascades for Converting Waste PET into Tamibarotene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase PestE shows promiscuous activity in catalysing the formation of a wide range of amides under aqueous conditions and can be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated in the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation product terephthalate into the leukemia drug tamibarotene. PestE variants F33L&#8194;F289A and F33L show improved activity for a model reaction and tamibarotene formation respectively.







Abstract
A growing number of hydrolase enzymes show promiscuous acyltransferase activity, even under aqueous conditions. Here we report, for the first time, the ability of Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 esterase (PestE) to catalyse the formation of a wide range of amides in buffer, where the acyl donor forms a significant structural component in the amide product. The reactions occur under mild conditions and can achieve conversions up to 97&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h for formation of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide as the model reaction. We demonstrate PestE's potential in enzyme cascades to make amides from waste PET plastic and the conversion of the terephthalic acid product to tamibarotene, a drug with activity against acute leukemia. Rational mutagenesis led to identification of PestE variants F33L&#8194;F289A and F33L. F33L&#8194;F289A increased conversion of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide by 1.2&#8208;fold, and F33L gave a 4&#8208;fold increase in conversion to tamibarotene.

         <title>Establishing a Robust Nonlinear Targeted Switch for C1 Electroproduction in Atomic Alloy Cox/Pd Bimetallenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear targeted switch was established by inserting tunable active Cox sites into Pd metallene using an atomic insertion strategy, which involved the creation of Co1/Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (favoring CO) and Co2/Pd diatomic alloy (favoring formate). The topological assembly of atomic alloy Cox/Pd bimetallenes with varying x values (ranging from 0 to 1 and then to 2) demonstrated a nonlinear high&#8208;contrast switch that enabled the desired C1 selectivity and ensured stability.







Abstract
Establishing a targeted switch for CO2 conversion under electric drive is essential for achieving carbon&#8208;balance by enabling selective chemicals. However, engineering the topological assembly of active sites to precisely regulate the competing pathways for various intermediates has been plagued by unclear structure&#8208;function relationships. To tailor the CO/formate pathways, herein we established a robust nonlinear targeted switch with tunable active Cox sites integrated into Pd metallene, which involves Co1/Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (favoring CO) and Co2/Pd diatomic alloy (favoring formate). Transitioning from Co1/Pd to Co2/Pd atomic alloy bimetallenes resulted in a nonlinear, high&#8208;contrast flip in selectivity, surpassing 94&#8201;% for CO and formate productions in both H&#8208;cell and flow cell. Furthermore, the superior selectivity and current efficiency for CO (&gt;80&#8201;%) and formate (&gt;88&#8201;%) were consistently maintained at &#8722;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over continuous 200&#8197;h. Theoretical simulations and in situ spectroscopy analyses unveiled that appropriate adjacent metal site combinations (Pd&#8722;Pd, Pd&#8722;Co and Co&#8722;Co) lead to tunable dz2 band center and a nonlinear shift in preferred adsorption configurations of intermediates, dictating the C1 pathways. Our finding reveals a desired switch in C1 selectivity and robust stability within Cox/Pd system, providing a new perspective for fine&#8208;tuning energy conversion processes through specific topological assembly.

         <title>Unraveling C&#8208;Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of Phosphiranes with Carboxylic Acids and Other Nucleophiles: A Mechanistically&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site selective nucleophilic attack at the carbon site of phosphiranes has been accomplished under metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction mechanism of this unprecedented transformation is discussed based on experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Phosphiranes are weak Lewis bases reacting with only a limited number of electrophiles to produce the corresponding phosphiranium ions. These salts are recognized for their propensity to undergo reactions with oxygen pronucleophiles at the phosphorus site, leading to the formation of phosphine oxide adducts. Building on a thorough mechanistic understanding, we have developed an unprecedented approach that enables the selective reaction of carboxylic acids, and other nucleophiles, at the carbon site of phosphiranes. This method involves the photochemical generation of highly reactive carbenes, which react with 1&#8208;mesitylphosphirane to yield ylides. The latter undergoes a stepwise reaction with carboxylic acids, resulting in the production of the desired phosphines. In addition to DFT calculations, we have successfully isolated and fully characterized the key intermediates involved in the reaction.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique molecular organization motifs of non&#8208;fullerene Yn acceptors, we synthesized 1gY&#8208;3gY, n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors, by sequentially introducing oligoethylene glycol sidechains. The mesh&#8208;like crystallization network of 1gY reveals independent ion and electron transport pathways, and extensive N&#8208;glycolation in 3gY enables high performance in conventional and vertical electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
The fundamental challenge in electron&#8208;transporting organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) is simultaneous optimization of electron and ion transport. Beginning from Y6&#8208;type/U&#8208;shaped non&#8208;fullerene solar cell acceptors, we systematically synthesize and characterize molecular structures that address the aforementioned challenge, progressively introducing increasing numbers of oligoethyleneglycol (OEG; g) sidechains from 1&#8197;g to 3&#8197;g, affording OMIECs 1gY, 2gY, and 3gY, respectively. The crystal structure of 1gY preserves key structural features of the Yn series: a U&#8208;shaped/planar core, close &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecular stacking, and interlocked acceptor groups. Versus inactive Y6 and Y11, all of the new glycolated compounds exhibit mixed ion&#8208;electron transport in both conventional organic electrochemical transistor (cOECT) and vertical OECT (vOECT) architectures. Notably, 3gY with the highest OEG density achieves a high transconductance of 16.5 mS, an on/off current ratio of ~106, and a turn&#8208;on/off response time of 94.7/5.7&#8197;ms in vOECTs. Systematic optoelectronic, electrochemical, architectural, and crystallographic analysis explains the superior 3gY&#8208;based OECT performance in terms of denser ngY OEG content, increased crystallite dimensions with decreased long&#8208;range crystalline order, and enhanced film hydrophilicity which facilitates ion transport and efficient redox processes. Finally, we demonstrate an efficient small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based complementary inverter using 3gY vOECTs, showcasing the bioelectronic applicability of these new small&#8208;molecule OMIECs.

         <title>Molecular Design of Mono&#8208;Fluorinated Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries and Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A mono&#8208;fluorinated linear ether of bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) methane (BFME) with OCH2O&#8208; segment was synthesized as solvent. With signal salt and signal solvent, the electrolyte showed low Li+&#8208;desolvation energy and high anion film&#8208;forming ability at interfaces under &#8722;60&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C, realizing the reversibly Li+ insertion/extraction process into graphite anode with an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 94.9&#8201;% and Li position/stripping CE of 99.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Fluorinated&#8208;ethers are promising electrolyte solvents in lithium metal batteries, for their high antioxidant and excellent reductive stability on Li anode. However, fluorinated&#8208;ethers with high fluorination degree suffer from low ionic conductivity and narrow temperature adaptibility. Herein, we synthesize a mono&#8208;fluorinated linear ether of bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) methane (BFME) with enhanced solvated ability. The &#8722;OCH2O&#8722; structure and fluoride substitution on the &#946;&#8208;C position endows the BFME electrolyte with moderate affinity to Li+, thereby improving the ionic conductivity and decreasing the Li+&#8208;desolvation energy barrier at a wide temperature range of &#8722;60&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte with anion&#8208;participated solvation structure demonstrates high film&#8208;forming ability by forming LiF&#8208;rich interfacial film on the electrode surfaces, rendering the graphite anode with an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 94.9&#8201;% and a Li plating/stripping CE of 99.8&#8201;% by Aurbach method. Consequently, the Graphite||LiFePO4 pouch cells delivered 83.2&#8201;%, 92.5&#8201;% and 81.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 1250, 200 and 300 cycles at 25, &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, the Li||LFP pouch cell with 3 Ah capacity can operate for 65 cycles with 99&#8201;% capacity retention, verifying the effectiveness of the BFME electrolyte in stabilizing the interfaces and broadening the temperature adaptibility of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic Activity Identification of Noble Metal Single&#8208;Sites for Electrocatalytic Chlorine Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ir, Ru)&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with identical M&#8722;N4 moiety was prepared and their intrinsic chlorine evolution performance was revealed to follow the trend of Pt1&#8722;N&#8722;C&gt;Ir1&#8722;N&#8722;C&gt;Ru1&#8722;N&#8722;C. The binding strength of Cl*&#8722;Cl intermediate can account for this activity trend, providing a reliable thermodynamic descriptor.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximal atom&#8208;utilization have emerged as promising alternatives for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) toward valuable Cl2 production. However, understanding their intrinsic CER activity has so far been plagued due to the lack of well&#8208;defined atomic structure controlling. Herein, we prepare and identify a series of atomically dispersed noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ir, Ru) in nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M1&#8722;N&#8722;C) with an identical M&#8722;N4 moiety, which allows objective activity evaluation. Electrochemical experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses collectively reveal that all the three M1&#8722;N&#8722;C proceed the CER via a direct Cl&#8208;mediated Vomer&#8208;Heyrovsk&#253; mechanism with reactivity following the trend of Pt1&#8722;N&#8722;C&gt;Ir1&#8722;N&#8722;C&gt;Ru1&#8722;N&#8722;C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this activity trend is governed by the binding strength of Cl*&#8722;Cl intermediate (&#916;GCl*&#8722;Cl) on M&#8722;N4 sites (Pt&lt;Ir&lt;Ru) featuring distinct d&#8208;band centers, providing a reliable thermodynamic descriptor for rational design of single metal sites toward Cl2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>n&#8208;ZrS3/p&#8208;ZrOS Photoanodes with NiOOH/FeOOH Oxygen Evolution Catalysts for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photoanode composed of ZrS3/ZrOS is designed for efficient solar water splitting. The photoanode features a dense, conformal p&#8208;type ZrOS layer on the n&#8208;type ZrS3, facilitating efficient hole extraction and providing protection against photocorrosion. By further incorporating NiOOH/FeOOH as the cocatalyst, efficient and durable photoelectrochemical water splitting is realized.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical water splitting offers a promising approach for carbon neutrality, but its commercial prospects are still hampered by a lack of efficient and stable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials. Here, we report a strategy to construct an efficient photoanode with a coaxial nanobelt structure, comprising a buried&#8208;ZrS3/ZrOS n&#8722;p junction, for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The p&#8208;type ZrOS layer, formed on the surface of the n&#8208;type ZrS3 nanobelt through a pulsed&#8208;ozone&#8208;treatment method, acts as a hole collection layer for hole extraction and a protective layer to shield the photoanode from photocorrosion. The resulting ZrS3/ZrOS photoanode exhibits light harvesting with good photo&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiencies across the whole visible region to over 650&#8197;nm. By further employing NiOOH/FeOOH as the oxygen evolution reaction cocatalyst, the ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode yields a photocurrent density of ~9.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode with an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of ~3.2&#8201;% under simulated sunlight irradiation in an alkaline solution (pH=13.6). The conformal ZrOS layer enables ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode operation over 1000&#8197;hours in an alkaline solution without obvious performance degradation. This study, offering a promising approach to fabricate efficient and durable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials, advances the frontiers of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of hypercrosslinked MOP (HCMOP) solid&#8208;state electrolyte was prepared using cationic MOPs, PEI macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units. Owing to the three&#8208;component synergistic effect, Li&#8208;HCMOP has excellent mechanical strength and can realize a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li&#8208;ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three&#8208;component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li&#8208;HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. The LiFePO4/Li battery exhibits high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li-ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium-metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal-organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three-component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li-HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li-ion conductivity, a high Li-ion transference number and a low activation energy. The LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Li battery exhibits high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers. This work highlights an effective idea of high-performance MOP-based solid-state electrolytes applied in LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomorphic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, were synthesized by grafting strategy. Among them, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 has suitable channels and can effectively separate C2H2/CO2, achieving an Ideal Adsorbent Solution Theory (IAST) selectivity of 201, thus establishing a new benchmark.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction was reported for the first time, which achieves the superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. The abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and the significantly improved the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability induced by the enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields should be the crucial factors.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.28&#8197;times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24&#8197;times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.

         <title>Mo Migration&#8208;Induced Crystalline to Amorphous Conversion and Formation of RuMo/NiMoO4 Heterogeneous Nanoarray for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the migration and segregation of Mo atoms and its superior affinity with Ru, the amorphous RuMo alloy&#8208;coupled amorphous NiMoO4 electrocatalyst is constructed, which promotes the directional evolution of interfacial water molecules and optimizes the d&#8208;band center and adsorption energy of relevant reaction intermediates, thereby contributing to remarkable electrocatalytic bifunctionality, especially at large current densities.







Abstract
Manipulating the atomic structure of the catalyst and tailoring the dissociative water&#8208;hydrogen bonding network at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface is essential for propelling alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), but remains a great challenge. Herein, we constructed an advanced a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF heterogeneous electrocatalyst with amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters anchored to amorphous NiMoO4 skeletons on Ni foam by a heteroatom implantation strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman tests show that the amorphous and alloying structure of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF not only induces the directional evolution of interfacial H2O, but also lowers the d&#8208;band center (from &#8722;0.43 to &#8722;2.22&#8197;eV) of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*, from &#8722;1.29 to &#8722;0.06&#8197;eV), and the energy barrier of HzOR (&#916;GN2(g)=1.50&#8197;eV to &#916;GN2*=0.47&#8197;eV). Profiting from these favorable factors, the a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances, especially at large current densities, with an overpotential of 13 and 129&#8197;mV to reach 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for HER. While for HzOR, it needs only &#8722;91 and 276&#8197;mV to deliver 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Further, the constructed a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF||a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420&#8197;mV to afford 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Time&#8208;Encoded Information Encryption with pH Clock Guided Broad&#8208;Spectrum Emission by Dynamic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D encryption: Using the time&#8208;gated broad&#8208;spectrum emission of a cyanostilbene&#8208;based AIE system under the influence of a pH clock, an additional dimension in the form of time is introduced for data encryption.







Abstract
With growing threats from counterfeiting&#8208;based security breaches, multi&#8208;level and specific stimuli&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and message encryption methods have attracted immense research interest. Fluorescence&#8208;based encryption from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;based materials solves the problems to a considerable extent. However, the development of smarter patterns with hierarchical security levels alongside dynamic display is still challenging. To screen out this complication, we bring forward a pH&#8208;switchable fluorescent assembly of an AIEgen and an aliphatic acid.

     alt="Time-Encoded Information Encryption with pH Clock Guided Broad-Spectrum Emission by Dynamic Assemblies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4D encryption&lt;/b&gt;: Using the time-gated broad-spectrum emission of a cyanostilbene-based AIE system under the influence of a pH clock, an additional dimension in the form of time is introduced for data encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With growing threats from counterfeiting-based security breaches, multi-level and specific stimuli-responsive anti-counterfeiting devices and message encryption methods have attracted immense research interest. Fluorescence-based encryption from aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based materials solves the problems to a considerable extent. However, the development of smarter patterns with hierarchical security levels alongside dynamic display is still challenging. To screen out this complication, we bring forward a pH-switchable fluorescent assembly of an AIEgen and an aliphatic acid. We later temporally direct the molecular assembly with the aid of a chemical trigger-regulated pH clock, generating a transitory multicolor emission, including transient white light generation. The pH-dependent emissions were further implemented in constructing smart multi-input fluorescent chemical AND gates. Subsequently, we integrate the time-gated emissive system to develop an advanced multi-dimensionally secure data encryption strategy. This novel approach enhances anti-counterfeiting measures by introducing an additional layer of security based on temporal characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchoring Catalytic Metal Nodes within a Single&#8208;Crystalline Pyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy was presented by synthesizing a single&#8208;crystalline pyrazolate MOF, PCN&#8208;1004, which features one&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;pyrazolate chains and exceptional stability. PCN&#8208;1004 shows outstanding catalytic activity in cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;O/C&#8722;S bonds without directing groups, achieving yields of up to ~99&#8201;%, with long cycle lives and high substrate compatibility.







Abstract
The synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline and robust pyrazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Pz&#8208;MOFs) capable of facilitating challenging organic transformations is fundamentally significant in catalysis. Here we demonstrate a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy by synthesizing a single&#8208;crystalline and robust Pz&#8208;MOF (PCN&#8208;1004). PCN&#8208;1004 features one&#8208;dimensional (1D) copper&#8208;Pz chains interconnected by well&#8208;organized ligands, forming a porous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network with two types of 1D open channels. Notably, PCN&#8208;1004 displays exceptional stability in aqueous solutions across a broad pH range (1 to 14), attributed to the robust copper&#8208;Pz coordination bond. Significantly, PCN&#8208;1004 functions as an outstanding catalyst in cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;O/C&#8722;S bonds, even in the absence of directing groups, achieving yields of up to ~99&#8201;%, with long cycle lives and high substrate compatibility. PCN&#8208;1004 outperforms all previously reported porphyrin&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Control experiments and computations elucidate the pivotal catalytic role of the copper&#8208;Pz chains and reveal a free radical pathway for the reaction. This work not only demonstrates the successful implementation of a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy for the efficient catalysis of challenging organic transformations but also highlights the synergistic effect of a robust framework, 1D open channels, and active sites in enhancing catalytic efficiency within MOFs.

         <title>Simultaneous Tailoring of Chemical Composition and Morphology Configuration in Metal Hexacyanoferrate for Ultrafast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high&#8208;entropy metal hexacyanoferrate assembled by nanocubes to realize ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) with adjustable composition and open framework structures have been considered as intriguing cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Exploiting MHCFs with ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity is always a goal that many investigators pursue, but remains challenging. Herein, simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high&#8208;entropy MHCF (HMHE&#8208;HCF) assembled by nanocubes for the first time to realize the objective. The &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; of high&#8208;entropy construction, rich sodium content of monoclinic phase, and unique hollow structure endow HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode with fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance during continuous charging/discharging processes. As a result, the HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode demonstrates superior rate performance up to an ultra&#8208;high rate of 100&#8197;C (71.1&#8201;% retention to 0.1&#8197;C), and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.8&#8201;% over 25,000&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;C, outperforming most reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. Further, the HMHE&#8208;HCF//hard carbon full&#8208;cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and retains 98.1&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 1,600&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium&#8208;ion storage.

         <title>Heterochiral &#960;&#8208;Stacking Dimerization of Helical Secondary Structures with Emerging Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific interface mode type was observed between helical secondary structures, in which a left&#8208;handed (M) helix binds specifically to a right&#8208;handed (P) helix along the helical axis, leading to the formation of discrete heterochiral helical dimers. Moreover, a concealed supramolecular chirality within the meso&#8208;supramolecular dimers was unexpectedly discovered by chiral induction, and was further underpinned by covalent meso&#8208;helix structures.

         <title>Structures of a DNA Polymerase Caught while Incorporating Responsive Dual&#8208;Functional Nucleotide Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environment&#8208;sensitive C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified nucleotide probes serve as excellent substrates for Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq). The probes provided unprecedent insight into the chemical&#8208;space tolerance and incorporation mechanism of the enzyme in real&#8208;time by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy, and at the atomic level by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Functionalizing nucleic acids using DNA polymerases is essential in biophysical and biotechnology applications. This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, the responsiveness of FBFdUTP enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the plasticity of the enzyme. Key insight is provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.

         <title>In situ Cyclization of Aromatic Thioethers in Emissive Materials to Generate Phosphorescent Dibenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced cyclization of thioethers was investigated in detail. The obtained phosphorescent dibenzothiophenes exhibit remarkable luminescence in frozen matrices with ultralong lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity. Furthermore, inducing the reaction in situ in polymer films and within 3D&#8208;printed objects allows for information storage in easily processable materials via ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
In this contribution, we explored the photocyclization of thioethers to highly substituted dibenzothiophenes (DBT) using solely UV&#8208;light without any need for additives. This cost&#8208;effective, robust and environmentally friendly approach yielded phosphorescent compounds, which were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photophysical methods. The resulting DBTs feature ultralong photoluminescence lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity in frozen glassy matrices. The reaction mechanism was elucidated in detail through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental results, providing evidence that triplet states are involved in the cyclization process. Additionally, the photoreaction can also be induced within materials. For this purpose, the precursors were integrated into polymer films or polymer resins suitable for 3D printing. Irradiation of these polymeric objects allows motifs with ultralong phosphorescence to be irreversibly inscribed through the proceeding photocyclization. The in situ photogeneration of DBTs from aromatic thioethers overcomes the observed incompatibilities regarding solubility in polymer resins for 3D printing.

         <title>Specifically Editing Cancer Sialoglycans for Enhanced In Vivo Immunotherapy through Aptamer&#8208;Enzyme Chimeras</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel aptamer&#8208;enzyme chimera (ApEC) which can efficiently and specifically remove sialic acids on cancer cell surface with high biosafety. ApEC facilitates the blockade of immunosuppressive sialoglycan&#8208;Siglecs axis, thereby augmenting immune cell response and enhancing tumor immunotherapy, providing a new approach for the elimination of glycoimmune checkpoints.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have demonstrated remarkable clinical success in treating cancer. However, their objective response rate remains suboptimal because current therapies rely on limited immune checkpoints that fail to cover the multiple immune evasion pathways of cancer. To explore potential ICB strategies, we propose a glycoimmune checkpoint elimination (glycoICE) therapy based on targeted editing of sialoglycans on the tumor cell surface using an aptamer&#8208;enzyme chimera (ApEC). The ApEC can be readily generated via a one&#8208;step bioorthogonal procedure, allowing for large&#8208;scale and uniform production. It specifically targets and desialylates cancer cells, disrupting the sialoglycan&#8208;Siglec axis to activate immune cells and enhance immunotherapy efficacy, while its high tumor selectivity minimizes side effects from indiscriminate desialylation of normal tissues. Furthermore, the ApEC has the potential to be a versatile platform for specific editing of sialoglycans in different tumor models by adjusting the aptamer sequences to target specific protein markers. This research not only introduces a novel molecular tool for the effective editing of sialoglycans in complex environments, but also provides valuable insights for advancing DNA&#8208;based drugs towards in vivo and clinical applications.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Cluster&#8208;based Spin Crossover Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive cluster transformations in the cluster&#8208;based spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are firstly realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation, which are accompanied by the topological changes from 3,4,6&#8208;T108 to urk and magnetic modulations.







Abstract
Cluster&#8208;based spin crossover (SCO) frameworks are a new class of smart metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse structures and topologies and unique bistable physicochemical properties. Here, we report a cluster&#8208;based SCO framework [Fe3{Ag4(CN)6(H2O)}2(TPBA)3](ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7DMF (1) with an extremely rare 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology, in which the tripodal [Ag{Ag(CN)2}3(H2O)]2&#8722; clusters axially link the Fe2+ ions to form 2D&#8594;3D n&#8208;fold Borromean entangled networks. Under the guidance of reticular chemistry, the post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) from 1 with 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology to [Fe3{Ag8X8(CN)6}(TPBA)3] (2_X, X=Cl, Br, I) with urk topology is firstly achieved via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Moreover, the successive SCSC transformations from 2_Cl to 2_Br and then to 2_I are realized for the first time. Their SCO behaviors are also modified by halogen&#8208;driven stepwise cluster transformations. Hence, these findings provide new strategies for the development of cluster&#8208;based SCO MOFs towards the smart functional porous materials.

         <title>Concise and Modular Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Bisbenzylisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bisBIAs) were synthesized in five to seven steps through a chemoenzymatic approach. An enzymatic Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction followed by selective enzymatic methylation or chemical functionalizations enabled the scalable synthesis of BIA monomers. Subsequent modular assembly was achieved by a modified Ullmann coupling or oxidative coupling, with macrocyclization through intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction or Ullmann coupling.







Abstract
The bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bisBIAs) have attracted tremendous attention from the synthetic community due to their diverse and intriguing biological activities. Herein, we report the convergent and modular chemoenzymatic syntheses of eight bisBIAs bearing various substitutes and linkages in 5&#8211;7 steps. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various well&#8208;designed enantiopure benzylisoquinoline monomers was accomplished through an enzymatic stereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, followed by regioselective enzymatic methylation or chemical functionalization in a sequential one&#8208;pot process. A modified intermolecular copper&#8208;mediated Ullmann coupling enabled the concise and efficient total synthesis of five different linear bisBIAs with either head&#8208;to&#8208;tail or tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail linkage. A biomimetic oxidative phenol dimerization selectively formed the sterically hindered, electron&#8208;rich diaryl ether bond, and subsequent intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura domino reaction or Ullmann coupling facilitated the first enantioselective total synthesis of three macrocyclic bisBIAs, including ent&#8208;isogranjine, tetrandrine and O&#8208;methylrepandine. This study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in the total synthesis of diverse bisBIAs and paves the way to further explore the biological functions of these natural products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform composed of engineered bacteria is developed to perform photochemical reactions for photodynamic therapy in a self&#8208;driven manner. One E. coli strain was genetically modified to produce 5&#8208;ALA and KatG, enabling the generation of PpIX and oxygen within tumors. Another E. coli strain was engineered to autonomously emit bioluminescence under the regulation of quorum sensing, to excite the photosensitizer formed in tumors.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used clinically to treat superficial tumors for decades. However, its effectiveness against deep&#8208;seated tumors has been limited by the inefficient delivery of the key components &#8208;light, photosensitizer, and oxygen&#8208; required for the photochemical reactions in PDT. Here, we present a novel platform that enables the photochemical reaction to occur in a self&#8208;driven manner, eliminating the need for external delivery of these components and instead orchestrating their endogenous generation within tumors. This was achieved by genetically modifying probiotic Escherichia coli to host three modules &#8208; Lux, Hem1, and KatG &#8208; responsible for light production, photosensitizer biosynthesis, and oxygen generation, respectively. The system is self&#8208;driven, relying solely on substrates within E. coli cells and tumors. The modules exhibited prolonged activity for days within in vivo mouse models, enabling metronomic PDT that induced an immune response. This research holds promise for revolutionizing PDT and overcoming the enduring challenges encountered in its application for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors.

         <title>Photo&#8208;activation of Tolane&#8208;based Synthetic Ion Channel for Transmembrane Chloride Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive tolane&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels are reported. Uncaging o&#8208;nitrobenzyl groups from the corresponding transport inactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based caged system leads to the formation of self&#8208;assembled barrel rosette ion channels. These channels emerged as anion&#8208;selective channels, primarily operating through an antiport mechanism and having profound selectivity towards Cl&#8722; ion.







Abstract
While natural channels respond to external stimuli to regulate ion concentration across cell membranes, creating a synthetic version remains challenging. Here, we present a photo&#8208;responsive uncaging technique within an artificial ion channel system, which activates the ion transport process from a transport&#8208;inactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based caged system. From the comparative ion transport screening, 1&#8201;b emerged as the most active transporter. Interestingly, its bis(o&#8208;nitrobenzyl) derivative, i.e., protransporter 1&#8201;b&#8242; was inefficient in transporting ions. Detailed transport studies indicated that compound 1&#8201;b is an anion selective transporter with a prominent selectivity towards chloride ions by following the antiport mechanism. Compound 1&#8201;b&#8242; did not form an ion channel, but after the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl groups were photocleaved, it released 1&#8201;b, forming a transmembrane ion channel. The channel exhibited an average diameter of 6.5&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; and a permeability ratio of 

PCl-/PK+=7.3&#177;1.5

 ${{P}_{{Cl}^{-}}/{P}_{{K}^{+}}=7.3\pm 1.5}$



. The geometry&#8208;optimization of protransporter 1&#8201;b&#8242; indicated significant non&#8208;planarity, corroborating its inefficient self&#8208;assembly. In contrast, the crystal structure of 1&#8201;b demonstrates strong self&#8208;assembly via the formation of an intermolecular H&#8208;bond. Geometry optimization studies revealed the plausible self&#8208;assembled channel model and the interactions between the channel and chloride ion.

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise modification of tin&#8208;oxo clusters via the heterometal strategy, specifically varying the metal dopants and their coordination geometries, has resulted in SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2, thereby tuning their distinct lithography performance.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs Atomic Force Microscopy&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50&#8197;nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8722;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective Recovery of Gold from E&#8208;Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) synthesized with different anions showed excellent extraction of gold from water and even from electronic waste leaching solution. The counter anions indeed affected the capture performance, demonstrating that these ionic COFs could be developed as high&#8208;performance gold recovery materials for e&#8208;waste treatment.







Abstract
The existing electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and leaching solutions generated by industries accumulate significant amounts of gold (Au), even in excess of those in natural minerals. Therefore, the recycling of Au is extremely significant for the potential sustainability of chemical industry. By designing ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), here we synthesize a series of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;X (X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, and SO42&#8722;) by anion regulation strategy and further explore their adsorption performance towards Au recovery. All these ionic COFs exhibit ultrahigh gold adsorption efficiency and excellent regeneration. Moreover, anion regulation could indeed affect the Au capture performance. In particular, when Cl&#8722; ions serve as counter ions, the Au capacity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl could reach 1270.8&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, in the actual CPU leaching solution test, the selectivity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl towards Au3+ ion hits 39000 and 4600 times higher than that of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions, respectively, suggesting that the Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl is a promising material for highly selective recovering gold from actual e&#8208;waste. DFT calculations further reveal that counter ions can regulate the adsorption affinity of ionic COF framework toward Au. In short, this work provides a useful anion regulation strategy to design ionic COFs as a promising platform for gold selective recovery from actual e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Anisotropic Hollow Structure with Chemotaxis Enabling Intratumoral Autonomic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic hollow multishell structures (HoMS) with chemotaxis capabilities for intratumoral autonomic therapy are fabricated in one step. These structures exhibit a superior diffusion coefficient and directionality, realizing positive chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. The anisotropic HoMS can reduce the glucose supply to tumors, demonstrating superior antitumor efficacy.







Abstract
Effective intratumoral drug penetration is pivotal for successful cancer treatment. However, due to the disrupted capillary networks and poor perfusion in solid tumors, there exist challenges to realize autonomous directional drug penetration and controlled drug release within the tumor. Considering the specificity of glucose within tumor tissue, we draw inspiration from nature and engineer asymmetrical hollow structures exhibiting chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. By incorporating multiple shells into these structures, we enhance the local chemical concentration gradients, thereby improving cellular uptake and precise targeting. The advantages of anisotropic hollow multishell structure (a&#8208;HoMS) can be reflected from the diffusion coefficient and directivity, which increase by 73.4&#8201;% and 273&#8201;% respectively compared to conventional isotropic hollow spheres, achieving the most linear movement while ensuring the speed of movement. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;level porosity and temporal&#8208;spatial order of a&#8208;HoMS enable sequential drug delivery that inhibits angiogenesis with inducing cell apoptosis. After the eradication of localized tumor cells, the a&#8208;HoMS can automatically migrate to the alive tumor cells under the glucose gradient, inducing another cycle of drug delivery and chemotaxis, resulting in excellent antitumor efficacy. These anisotropic HoMS demonstrate intelligence, adaptability, and precision in tumor therapy, providing valuable insights for programmable treatment within tissues.

&lt;p&gt;Anisotropic hollow multishell structures (HoMS) with chemotaxis capabilities for intratumoral autonomic therapy are fabricated in one step. These structures exhibit a superior diffusion coefficient and directionality, realizing positive chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. The anisotropic HoMS can reduce the glucose supply to tumors, demonstrating superior antitumor efficacy.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Air&#8208;Stable Radical Formation in Tetraphenylpyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer process in tetraphenylpyrene derivatives and enhanced the air stability of photo&#8208;generated radicals by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions between molecules. All TPPy, Py&#8208;TTA, and Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrate photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer processes under solid&#8208;state conditions. While TPPy exhibits limited stability of photo&#8208;induced radicals in the atmosphere, observable on the picosecond scale through femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy. Py&#8208;TTA shows a slight improvement in radical stability with weak signals observed using EPR technology despite their brief presence in the atmosphere. After irradiation, Py&#8208;TTAc molecules display distinctive EPR signals, with a radical concentration of up to 2.21&#8201;%. Moreover, Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrates excellent reproducibility in generating photo&#8208;induced radicals.







Abstract
Stable organic radicals generated by photo&#8208;excitation hold applications in molecular switching devices and information storage. It remains challenging to develop photo&#8208;generated radical materials with rapid response and air stability in the solid state. Here, we report a structure based on 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraphenylpyrene derivative (Py&#8208;TTAc) displaying photo&#8208;induced radicals with air stability in the solid state. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, exposed to a 365&#8197;nm ultraviolet lamp for 1&#8197;minute, affords radicals in Py&#8208;TTAc powder as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The maximum radical concentration reaches 2.21&#8201;% after continuous irradiation for 1&#8197;hour and recurs more than 10&#8197;times without any chemical degradation. The mechanistic study according to the femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) and X&#8208;ray technology suggests that the radicals are derived from photo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) and stabilized through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The photo&#8208;generated stable radical system is employed in anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper and optoelectronic device applications. This study will provide insights into the development of photoactive organic radical materials.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of a Multiple Resonance Core: Double Helical and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs) and three BN&#8208;NGs containing heptagon rings were synthesized. These compounds exhibited orange to near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions. The incorporation of B and N heteroatoms promoted the formation of heptagon rings, which improved the chiroptical dissymmetry factor.







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) boron&#8211;nitrogen doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have shown compelling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), surpassing those of their hydrocarbon analogues. However, the structural variety of &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;PAHs remains narrow. In this study, we synthesized three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs), 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c, and three heptagon&#8208;embedded BN&#8208;NGs, 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, by &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR core. During the formation of 2&#8201;a, a nanographene with one heptagon (1&#8201;a) was obtained, whereas further dehydrocyclization of the [6]helicene units within 2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;c led to heptagon structures, yielding other two BN&#8208;NGs containing double heptagons (1&#8201;b and 1&#8201;c). These BN&#8208;NGs (2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c and 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c) showed pronounced redshifts of 100&#8211;190&#8197;nm compared to the parent MR core, while preserving the TADF characteristics and prolonging the delayed fluorescence lifetime to the millisecond level. Furthermore, the integration of a heptagon ring into 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c expanded the conjugation, reduced the oxidation potentials, and yielded a more flexible framework compared to those of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c. The enantiomers of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c, 1&#8201;a, and 1&#8201;c were resolved and their chiroptical properties were studied. Notably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;c exhibited increased chiroptical dissymmetry factors.

         <title>Does H2 Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction Always Probe Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry? The Case of Pt/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions on transition metal oxides are crucial in heterogeneous catalysis. H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR) is often used to measure oxide reducibility by monitoring H2 consumption. However, oxide reduction involves steps like H2 dissociation and H&#8208;diffusion before H2O formation. Our study on CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 found that TPR kinetics relate to H&#8208;spillover at Pt&#8208;CeO2 interface and Pt nanocluster abundance, not CeO2 reducibility.







Abstract
Redox reactions on the surface of transition metal oxides are of broad interest in thermo, photo, and electrocatalysis. H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR) is commonly used to probe oxide reducibility by measuring the rate of H2 consumption during temperature ramps, assuming that this rate is controlled by oxide reduction. However, oxide reduction involves several elementary steps, such as H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover, before surface reduction and H2O formation occur. In this study, we evaluated the kinetics of H2 consumption over CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 with varying Pt loadings and structures to identify the elementary steps probed by H2&#8208;TPR. Literature often attributes changes in H2&#8208;TPR characteristics with Pt addition to increased CeO2 reducibility. However, our analysis revealed that the H2 consumption rate is measurement of the rate of H&#8208;spillover at Pt&#8208;CeO2 interfaces and is determined by the concentration of Pt species on Pt nanoclusters that dissociate H2. Therefore, lower temperature H2 consumption observed with Pt addition does not indicate higher CeO2 reducibility. Measurements on samples with mixtures of Pt single&#8208;atoms and nanoclusters demonstrated that H2&#8208;TPR can effectively quantify dilute Pt nanocluster concentrations, suggesting caution in directly linking H2&#8208;TPR characteristics to oxide reducibility while highlighting alternative material insights that can be gleaned.

         <title>Tailoring O&#8208;Monodentate Adsorption of CO2 Initiates C&#8722;N Coupling for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis with Ultrahigh Carbon Atom Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of conventional C&#8208; or bridging O&#8208;linked pathways, the single O adsorption pathway for CO2 is tailored with moderate oxophilic transition metal single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts to enhance *OCO activation, which can markedly improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of the initial C&#8722;N coupling (*OCO+*NO2&#8594;*OCONO2) and protonation rate&#8208;determining step (*OCONH2&#8594;*OCOHNH2), thereby culminating in ultrahigh C selectivity and efficiency for urea electrosynthesis.







Abstract
The thermodynamically and kinetically sluggish electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is inert to initially take place while typically occurring after CO2 protonation, which severely dwindles urea efficiency and carbon atom economy. Herein, we report a single O&#8208;philic adsorption strategy to facilitate initial C&#8722;N coupling of *OCO and subsequent protonation over dual&#8208;metal hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atoms in N2&#8722;Fe&#8722;(N&#8722;B)2&#8722;Cu&#8722;N2 coordination mode (FeN4/B2CuN2@NC), which greatly inhibits the formation of C&#8208;containing byproducts and facilitates urea electrosynthesis in an unprecedented C&#8208;selectivity of 97.1&#8201;% with urea yield of 2072.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and 71.9&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes. The carbon&#8208;directed antibonding interaction with Cu&#8722;B is elaborated to benefit single O&#8208;philic adsorption of CO2 rather than conventional C&#8208;end or bridging O,O&#8208;end adsorption modes, which can accelerate the kinetics of initiated C&#8722;N coupling and protonation. Theoretical results indicate that the O&#8208;monodentate adsorption pathway benefits the thermodynamics of the C&#8722;N coupling of *OCO with *NO2 and the protonation rate&#8208;determining step, which markedly inhibits CO2 direct protonation. This oriented strategy of manipulating reactant adsorption patterns to initiate a specific step is universal to moderate oxophilic transition metals and offers a kinetic&#8208;enhanced path for multiple conversion processes.

         <title>Living Cell&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free Spontaneous Polymerization of Zwitterionic Methacrylates for Preparation of Probiotic&#8208;Loaded Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bacteria&#8208;mediated polymerization of zwitterionic methacrylates proceeds in the absence of conventional catalysts, initiators, or light irradiation. The method leverages the intrinsic metabolism of living bacteria to initiate free radical polymerization that affords polyzwitterions with high molecular weight. In&#8197;situ hydrogelation encapsulates living bacteria effectively, offering potentials to biomedical applications.







Abstract
Living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization offers promising applications in biomaterials, yet its further biological utilization is hindered by the need for metal ions or radical initiators with available methods. In this study, we introduce a living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization that leverages the intrinsic metabolic activities of living cells to initiate and sustain free radical polymerization of zwitterionic methacrylates. The polymerization proceeded in the absence of transition metal catalysts, radical initiators, or light sources. The conversion of zwitterionic methacrylate strongly correlated with cellular activities and achieved a maximum conversion of 98&#8201;% within 48&#8197;hours. Living cells efflux redox power across membranes through metabolism and that terminal electron fluxes are captured by zwitterionic methacrylates pre&#8208;assembled on the living cell surface to initiate radical polymerization reactions. The polymerization caused significant changes to the cell membrane surface and synthesized hydrogels with tailored mechanical properties. The polymer hydrogel obtained via probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 was able to release the in&#8197;situ encapsulated molecules, which demonstrated living cell&#8208;mediated polymer hydrogel as a vehicle for the delivery of both cellular and molecular therapeutic agents. This research offered a green and efficient method for synthesizing bioactive materials and advancing the field of cellular therapeutics and drug delivery.

         <title>Dinuclear Cyclometalated Pincer Nickel(II) Complexes with Metal&#8208;Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear pincer&#8208;type Ni(II) complexes bridged by formamidinate/&#945;&#8208;carbolinato ligands and the dinuclear Pt(II) and Pd(II) analogues were studied. These Ni(II) complexes show short Ni&#8722;Ni distances, resulting in a singlet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer transition. At 77&#8197;K, they show phosphorescence (2.6&#8211;8.6&#8197;&#956;s) in the NIR (800&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) spectral region in 2&#8208;MeTHF and in the solid state, which originates from the 3dd excited state as supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Facile non&#8208;radiative decay of low&#8208;lying metal&#8208;centered (MC) dd excited states has been well documented to pose a significant obstacle to the development of phosphorescent NiII complexes due to substantial structural distortions between the dd excited state and the ground state. Herein, we prepared a series of dinuclear Ni2II,II complexes by using strong &#963;&#8208;donating carbene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbene (CNHC&#8201;Cphenyl&#8201;CNHC) pincer ligands, and prepared their dinuclear Pt2II,II and Pd2II,II analogues. Dinuclear Ni2II,II complexes bridged by formamidinate/&#945;&#8208;carbolinato ligand exhibit short Ni&#8722;Ni distances of 2.947&#8211;3.054&#8197;&#197; and singlet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MMLCT) transitions at 500&#8211;550&#8197;nm. Their 1MMLCT absorption energies are red&#8208;shifted relative to the Pt2II,II and Pd2II,II analogues at ~450&#8197;nm and &#8804;420&#8197;nm respectively. One&#8208;electron oxidation of these Ni2II,II complexes produces valence&#8208;trapped dinuclear Ni2II,III species, which are characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Upon photoexcitation, these Ni2II,II complexes display phosphorescence (&#964;=2.6&#8211;8.6&#8197;&#956;s) in the NIR (800&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) spectral region in 2&#8208;MeTHF and in the solid state at 77&#8197;K, which is insensitive to &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the coordinated [CNHC&#8201;Cphenyl&#8201;CNHC] ligand. Combined with DFT calculations, the NIR emission is assigned to originate from the 3dd excited state. Studies have found that the dinuclear Ni2II,II complex can sensitize the formation of singlet oxygen and catalyze the oxidation of cyclo&#8208;dienes under light irradiation.

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 achieves excellent adaptability with loaded Cu nanoparticles (Cu NP) to form highly conductible and stable Cu/Ti4O7 interface, which enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between between Cu and Ti sites and accelerates the charge transfer for highly energy&#8208;efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide







Abstract
Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8722;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8722;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4&#8201;% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8722;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.

         <title>High&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Battery with Innovative Anolyte based on Steric Hindrance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries retain stability exceeding 1831&#8197;cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding an energy efficiency of ~80&#8201;% and maintains a steady discharge capacity.







Abstract
All&#8208;soluble all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries (AIRFBs) are an innovative energy storage technology that offer significant financial benefits. Stable and affordable redox&#8208;active materials are essential for the commercialization of AIRFBs, yet the battery stability must be significantly improved to achieve practical value. Herein, ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. The coordination structure and failure mechanism of our Fe&#8208;TIPA complexes were determined by molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic experiments. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFBs retained excellent stability exceeding 1831&#8197;cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding an energy efficiency of ~80&#8201;% and maintaining a steady discharge capacity. Moreover, the all&#8208;soluble electrolyte was tested in an industrial&#8208;scale Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFB prototype energy storage system, where an energy efficiency of 81.3&#8201;% was attained. Given the abundance of iron resources, we model the TIPA AIRFB electrolyte cost to be as low as 32.37&#8197;$/kWh, which is significantly cheaper than the current commercial level. This work demonstrates that steric hindrance is an effective measure to extended battery life, facilitating the commercial development of affordable flow batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; Radicals with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic P&#8208;bearing molecules, HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; are prepared as weakly bound complexes with CO in solid N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. The reaction kinetics for the spontaneous isomerization from HPN&#8901; to HNP&#8901; in the temperature range of 3&#8211;10&#8197;K reveals the dominant contribution by hydrogen atom tunneling.







Abstract
Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. Specifically, HPN&#8901; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254&#8197;nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8901;. The &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1&#8197;min at 3&#8197;K. Upon further irradiation at 254&#8197;nm, the reverse conversion of &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.

         <title>Interfacially Fabricated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Film&#8208;Based Fluorescence Humidity Sensors and Moisture Driven Actuators</title>

A COF membrane&#8208;based high&#8208;performance fluorescence humidity sensor with centimeter size was developed. The sensor depicted unprecedented detection sensitivity, fast response, full reversibility, and robust durability.







Abstract
Rapid, on&#8208;site measurement of ppm&#8208;level humidity in real time remains a challenge. In this work, we fabricated a few micrometer thick, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) membrane via interfacially confined condensation of 1,3,5&#8208;tris&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)triazine (TTA) with 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;formylphloroglucinol (TP). Based on the super&#8208;sensitive and reversible response of the COF membrane to water vapor, we developed a high&#8208;performance film&#8208;based fluorescence humidity sensor, depicting unprecedented detection limit of 0.005&#8197;ppm, fast response/recovery (2.2&#8197;s/2.0&#8197;s), and a detection range from 0.005 to 100&#8197;ppm. Remarkably, more than 7,000&#8208;time continuous tests showed no observable change in the performance of the sensor. The applicability of the sensor was verified by on&#8208;site and real&#8208;time monitoring of humidity in a glovebox. The superior performance of the sensor was ascribed to the highly porous structure and unique affinity of the COF membrane to water molecules as they enable fast mass transfer and efficient utilization of the water binding sites. Moreover, based on the remarkable moisture driven deformation of the COF membrane and its composition with the known polyimide films, some conceptual actuators were created. This study brings new ideas to the design of ultra&#8208;sensitive film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors (FFSs) and high&#8208;performance actuators.

         <title>Emulating &#8220;Curvature&#8208;Enhanced Adsorbate Coverage&#8221; for Superconformal and Orientated Zn Electrodeposition in Zinc&#8208;ion&#8208;Batteries</title>

A re&#8208;arranged (002) textured Zn anode in Zinc&#8208;ion&#8208;Batteries. We design a rearranged (002) textured Zn anode inspired by a curvature&#8208;enhanced adsorbate coverage (CEAC) process to realize a highly reversible Zn anode for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The spatially re&#8208;arranged crystal planes induce the superconformal Zn deposition and the epitaxial Zn deposition along (002) orientations and alleviate the parasitic reactions.







Abstract
Uneven Zn deposition and unfavorable side reactions have prevented the reversibility of the Zn anode. Herein, we design a rearranged (002) textured Zn anode inspired by a traditional curvature&#8208;enhanced adsorbate coverage (CEAC) process to realize the highly reversible Zn anode. The rearranged (002) textured structure directs superconformal Zn deposition by controlling the spatial deposition rate of the rearranged crystal planes, thereby promoting bottom&#8208;up &#8220;superfilling&#8221; of the 3D Zn skeletons. Meanwhile, our designed anode also induces the epitaxial Zn deposition, alleviating the parasitic reactions owing to the lowest surface energy of the (002) plane. Attributed to these superiorities, uniform and oriented Zn deposition can be obtained, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 479&#8197;hrs at an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 82.12&#8201;%. The Zn|Na2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O battery delivers an improved cycling performance, even at a high area capacity of 5.15&#8197;mAh/cm2 with a low negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratio of 1.63. The superconformal deposition approach for Zn anodes paves the way for the practical application of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dual Ion Co&#8208;Insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative electrolyte regulation strategy is developed to improve the performance of KCo[Fe(CN)6] cathode in aqueous zinc ion battery. The dissolution of high&#8208;spin metal ion (Co) in KCo[Fe(CN)6] is suppressed. The dual ion co&#8208;insertion induces a novel and reversible phase conversion reaction in which low&#8208;spin atom (Fe) in KCo[Fe(CN)6] are replaced. An ultra&#8208;long life aqueous zinc ion battery is achieved.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and dissolution of high&#8208;spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co&#8208;inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co&#8208;insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low&#8208;spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and metal&#8208;ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% over 4400&#8197;cycles at 40&#8197;C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co&#8208;intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.

         <title>A Critical View on the Use of DNA Hydrogels in Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA hydrogel materials encoding proteins have been credited with improved efficiency over conventional templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS). This systematic study with different bulk DNA materials finds no significant improvement, but highlights the potential of this approach for future advancements in automation.







Abstract
Numerous studies have reported in the past that the use of protein&#8208;encoding DNA hydrogels as templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) leads to better yields than the use of conventional templates such as plasmids or PCR fragments. Systematic investigation of different types of bulk materials from pure DNA hydrogels and DNA hydrogel composites using a commercially available CFPS kit showed no evidence of improved expression efficiency. However, protein&#8208;coding DNA hydrogels were advantageously used in microfluidic reactors as immobilized templates for repetitive protein production, suggesting that DNA&#8208;based materials offer potential for future developments in high&#8208;throughput profiling or rapid in situ characterization of proteins.

         <title>Oxygen Reduction Reaction Coupled Electro&#8208;Oxidation for Highly&#8208;Efficient and Sustainable Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to enable highly&#8208;efficient and sustainable water treatment by coupling the EO system with four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction is reported. This system achieves a 95&#8201;% total organic carbon (TOC) removal at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 2.61&#8197;kWh/kgTOC.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;oxidation (EO) technology demonstrates significant potential in wastewater treatment. However, the high energy consumption has become a pivotal constraint hindering its large&#8208;scale implementation. Herein, we design an EO and 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupled system (EO&#8208;4eORR) to replace the traditional EO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled system (EO&#8208;HER). The theoretical cathodic potential of the electrolytic reactor is tuned from 0&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in HER to 1.23&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in 4eORR, which greatly decreases the required operation voltage of the reactor. Moreover, we demonstrate that convection can improve the mass transfer of oxygen and organic pollutants in the reaction system, leading to low cathodic polarization and high pollutant removal rate. Compared with traditional EO&#8208;HER system, the energy consumption of the EO&#8208;4eORR system under air aeration for 95&#8201;% total organic carbon (TOC) removal is greatly decreased to 2.61&#8197;kWh/kgTOC (only consider the electrolyzer energy consumption), which is superior to previously reported EO&#8208;based water treatment systems. The reported results in this study offer a new technical mode for development of highly efficient and sustainable EO&#8208;based treatment systems to remove organic pollutants in waste water.

         <title>The Fischer&#8208;Lactonization&#8208;Driven Mechanism for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a Fischer&#8208;lactonisation&#8208;driven mechanism based on the nucleophilic substitution principle for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. The unique property of citric acid was exploited, which can be used as both a leaching and chelating agent, to induce chelation and further precipitation by precisely controlling its solution concentration. This mechanism mainly takes advantage of the nucleophilic attack between the carbon atom in the protonated carboxyl ion (&#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722;) on the citric acid chelate and the lone pair of electrons in its hydroxyl to promote the generation of the ester bond, thus forming the lactonized gel, which genuinely brings out the advantages of the bifunctionality of citric acid as a leaching agent and a chelating agent simultaneously. In this study, our innovative strategy enhances the simplicity and flexibility of traditional hydrometallurgical processes by eliminating the cumbersome separation and extraction procedures.

Abstract
Hydrometallurgy remains a major challenge to simplify its complex separation and precipitation processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we propose a Fischer&#8208;lactonization&#8208;driven mechanism for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. Citric acid undergoes a two&#8208;step dissociation of the carboxylic acid (&#8722;COOH) and complexes with the leached metal ion, while the residual &#8722;COOH is attacked by H protons to form a protonated carboxyl ion (&#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722;). Subsequently, the lone pair of electrons in the hydroxyl of the same molecule attack the carbon atom in &#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722; to facilitate ester bonding, leading to the formation of a lactonized gel. The leaching rates of Li, Ni, Co and Mn are 99.3, 99.1, 99.5 and 99.2&#8201;%, respectively. The regenerated monocrystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) has a uniform particle size distribution and complete lamellar structure, with a capacity retention rate of 70.6&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. The mechanism achieves a one&#8208;step chelation reaction, and the energy consumption and carbon emissions are only 26&#8201;% and 44&#8201;%, respectively, of that of the conventional hydrometallurgical. The strategy achieves a double breakthrough in simplifying the process and improving environmental friendliness, offering a sustainable approach to the re&#8208;utilization of spent LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;We proposed a Fischer-lactonisation-driven mechanism based on the nucleophilic substitution principle for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. The unique property of citric acid was exploited, which can be used as both a leaching and chelating agent, to induce chelation and further precipitation by precisely controlling its solution concentration. This mechanism mainly takes advantage of the nucleophilic attack between the carbon atom in the protonated carboxyl ion (&#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722;) on the citric acid chelate and the lone pair of electrons in its hydroxyl to promote the generation of the ester bond, thus forming the lactonized gel, which genuinely brings out the advantages of the bifunctionality of citric acid as a leaching agent and a chelating agent simultaneously. In this study, our innovative strategy enhances the simplicity and flexibility of traditional hydrometallurgical processes by eliminating the cumbersome separation and extraction procedures. Compared to traditional sol-gel methods, the strategy avoids the usage of large amounts of citric acid while eliminating the highly polluting part of pH adjustment by ammonia, allowing spontaneous gel formation in the original acidic environment. Most importantly, the strategy is further upgraded from the existing modification methods by eliminating the need to introduce additional alcohol solvents to provide the required alcohol for the lactonization reaction, thus reducing the consumption of organic solvents and improving the environmental friendliness of the process.

         <title>High Mass Transfer Rate in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Achieved with Efficient Quasi&#8208;Gas Phase System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;gas phase system is proposed to improve the mass transfer rate during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. The typical feature of this system is that the main site of HER is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment. As a result, the overpotential required in HER process at high current density is reduced remarkably.







Abstract
The adhesion of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface is one of the main factors limiting the performance of H2 evolution of electrolytic water, especially at high current density. To overcome this problem, here a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas phase&#8221; electrolytic water reaction system based on capillary effect is proposed for the first time to improve the mass transfer efficiency of H2. The typical feature of this reaction system is that the main site of H2 evolution reaction is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment above the bulk aqueous solution, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of H2 bubbles and reducing the resistance of their diffusion away. Electrochemical test results show that the proposed quasi&#8208;gas phase system can significantly reduce the potential required in H2 evolution reaction process at high current density compared with the conventional electrolytic reaction system. Specifically, the overpotential potential is reduced by 0.31&#8197;V when the H2 evolution current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved.

         <title>Customizing Bonding Affinity with Multi&#8208;Intermediates via Interfacial Electron Capture to Boost Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;nitride (WN&#8208;Ni3N) metallic heterostructure, featuring perfect lattice matching and high conductivity, was synthesized to function as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst, fine&#8208;tuning bonding orbital filling with alkaline HER intermediates. The heterointerface charge redistribution accelerates OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release, boosting performance and durability to last 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant alkaline HER electrocatalysts is pivotal for sustainable energy, but co&#8208;regulating its intricate multi&#8208;step process, encompassing water dissociation, OH&#8722; desorption, and hydrogen generation, is still a great challenge. Herein, we tackle these obstacles by fabricating a vertically integrated electrode featuring a nanosheet array with prominent dual&#8208;nitride metallic heterostructures characterized by impeccable lattice matching and excellent conductivity, functioning as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst to fine&#8208;tune the bonding affinity with alkaline HER intermediates. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculation elucidate that charge redistribution at the heterointerface reduces the O p&#8208;W d and H s&#8208;W d interactions vs. single nitride, thereby enhancing OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release. As anticipated, the resulting WN&#8208;NiN/CFP catalyst demonstrates a gratifying low overpotential of 36.8&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2 for alkaline HER, while concurrently maintaining operational stability for 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for overall water splitting. This work presents an effective approach to meticulously optimize multiple site&#8208;intermediate interactions in alkaline HER, laying the foundation for efficient energy conversion.

         <title>The Regulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Composite Lithium Anodes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform Li2S&#8208;rich SEI layer is formed between composite lithium metal anode and solid polymer electrolyte, which can effectively passivate the working interface for enhanced cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The full cells with such SEI render over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C under a high areal capacity of 2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal/SPE interface is a major challenge, as continuous SEI degradation and regeneration during cycling lead to capacity fading. This article investigates the SEI formation on lithium anodes (l&#8208;SEI) and composite lithium anodes (c&#8208;SEI) in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The composite anodes form a uniform Li2S&#8208;rich inorganic SEI layer and a thinner organic SEI layer, effectively passivating the interface for enhanced cycling stability. Specifically, the full cells with c&#8208;SEI anodes sustain over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C under a high areal capacity of 2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the reversible high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state pouch cells exhibit exceptional safety even after curling and cutting. These findings offer valuable insights into developing composite electrodes with robust SEI for solid&#8208;state polymer&#8208;based lithium metal batteries.

Four oxindolyl&#8208;based monoradicals (OxRs) with different substituents were synthesized and characterized. These OxRs can associate and dissociate reversibly in response to soft external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, and solvent polarity. Notably, the bond dissociation energies of OxR dimers can be finely tuned by the captodative effect between the radical sites and the attached substituents.







Abstract
Organic radicals based dynamic covalent chemistry is promising in preparing stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials, due to their simplicity of dissociation/association, accompanied with distinct color changes during the process. However, suitable organic radicals for dynamic covalent chemistry have not been widely explored yet. Herein, a series of oxindolyl&#8208;based mono&#8208;radicals (OxRs) with different substituents were successfully synthesized and studied systematically as potential building blocks for stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials. These OxRs would dimerize spontaneously to form their corresponding dimers. The structures of dimers were unambiguously confirmed through low&#8208;temperature 1H&#8197;NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Dynamic interconversion between monomers and dimers was achieved by reversible cleavage and recovery of the &#963;&#8208;bond upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure, and solvent polarity), accompanied by significant color changes. It is interesting that the stability of the mono&#8208;radical could be tuned through changing different substituents, and consequently altering the bond dissociation energy of the dynamic covalent bond between monomers. These new OxRs characterized by appreciable properties are entitled to more opportunities in developing mechanochromic and thermochromic materials, where their responsiveness to stimuli can be readily controlled by the substituents adhered.

         <title>Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from BN&#8208;Substituted Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives were prepared which exhibit oxygen&#8208;tolerant organic phosphorescence at room temperature in the solid state. These unexpected phosphors do not rely on typical strategies for organic phosphorescence, such as doping in polymer matrices, heavy atom incorporation, or the presence of known phosphorogenic functional groups.







Abstract
Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long&#8208;lived excited states and bathochromically&#8208;shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well&#8208;studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements. We report the unexpected ORTP of a series of heavy atom&#8208;free BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives. The creation of heteroatom&#8208;rich scaffolds, combined with stabilizing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions in the solid&#8208;state, resulted in oxygen&#8208;tolerant heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphorescence without relying on the use of cryogenic temperatures, polymer matrices, or host&#8211;guest interactions. The observation of ORTP in these simple systems sets a blueprint for the further development of heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphors.

         <title>The P(III)&#8208;Amidite Based Synthesis of Stable Isotope Labeled mRNA&#8208;Cap&#8208;Structures Enables their Sensitive Quantitation from Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an approach to synthesize high quality cap standards using P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. It enables ready access to stable isotope labeled internal standards in the milligram range. These references are the applied in the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8211;MS/MS method to study the cap epitranscriptome. The application to biological samples allowed the combined quantitation of cap structures as well as modified nucleosides in a single run.







Abstract
The 5&#8217; cap structure is crucial to mRNA function, with its diverse methylation patterns depending on the cellular state. Sensitive analytical methods are sought after to quantify this cap variety also referred to as cap epitranscriptome. To address a bottleneck for accurate and precise quantitation, we report a facile and fast access to high&#8208;quality synthetic standards via a new route, involving P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. A range of cap nucleotides and their stable heavy isotopic labeled analogues were derived from nucleoside diphosphates, which themselves were directly prepared in a one&#8208;step reaction sequence starting from unprotected nucleosides using a triphosphorylating reagent in combination with ethylenediamine. Considering a wider scope, the route also enables direct access to magic spot nucleotides and diphosphates of isoprenyl&#8208;alcohols. Stable&#8208;isotope labeled cap nucleotides derived from this route paved the way for the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8211;MS/MS method, applied to the characterization of mouse brain cap epitranscriptomes, which turned out to be very different from those of cultured cell lines of widespread use in the life sciences.

         <title>Thin Zinc Electrodes Stabilized with Organobromine&#8208;Partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH Cluster Ions for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Zn electroplating, BDOL of the organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ion preferentially adsorbs on the Zn surface and the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex part desolvates into ZnO&#8208;dominated Zn compounds, acting as the outer SEI. Subsequently, the formed ZnO induces the polymerization of the adsorbed BDOL, forming a polyether inner layer. Benefiting from this SEI, a stable high&#8208;DOD Zn plating/stripping on the thin Zn electrode is achieved.







Abstract
The utilization of thin zinc (Zn) anodes with a high depth of discharge is an effective strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs), but challenged by the poor reversibility of Zn electrode due to the serious Zn&#8208;consuming side reactions at the Zn||electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (BDOL) and methanol (MeOH) as electrolyte additive into aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the as&#8208;formulated electrolyte, BDOL with a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group (&#8722;CH2Br) tends to pair with the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex, leading to the formation of organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ions. During the Zn electrodeposition process, the formed ZnO&#8208;dominated by&#8208;products induce the polymerization of BDOL monomers, which are previously adsorbed on the electrode. As a result, a uniform dual&#8208;layer SEI with ZnO&#8208;dominated outer layer and polyether&#8208;dominated inner layer is built on the surface of Zn electrode. With such an in situ formed dual&#8208;layer SEI, the Zn||Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O pouch cell using a 10&#8208;um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300&#8197;cycles with a high capacity retention of 86&#8201;%, promising a high practical energy density of &gt;120&#8197;Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O).

         <title>Carbon Nanocage Supported Asymmetrically Coordinated Nickle Single&#8208;Atom for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction in Membrane Electrode Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow carbon carrier design of the Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst can facilitate increased active site exposure and improved mass transfer, achieving industrial&#8208;level current density within the membrane electrode assembly. Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C achieved nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across the wide current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt;97&#8201;%) over the current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66&#177;0.2&#8197;V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications.

&lt;p&gt;The hollow carbon carrier design of the Ni-NBr-C catalyst can facilitate increased active site exposure and improved mass transfer, achieving industrial-level current density within the membrane electrode assembly. Ni-NBr-C achieved nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across the wide current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni single-atom catalyst featuring axial Br coordination at NiN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co-doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr-assisted confined-pyrolysis strategy. The Ni-NBr-C catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;97&#8201;%) over the current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni-NBr-C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66&#177;0.2&#8197;V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over an 85-hour long-term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial-scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br not only enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlight that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doping In Vivo Alkylation in E. coli by Introducing the Direct Sulfurylation Pathway of S. cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are emerging enzymes for selective biocatalytic alkylation. Introduction of the direct sulfurylation pathway from S. cerevisiae improved methylation up to 17&#8208;fold, allowing straight&#8208;forward isolation of the methylated products. It also enabled in vivo alkylation of non&#8208;physiological substrates in E. coli by boosting the methionine (analogue) availability using off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf thiols as alkyl donor.







Abstract
Methylation and alkylation are important techniques used for the synthesis and derivatisation of small molecules and natural products. Application of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) in biotechnological hosts such as Escherichia coli lowers the environmental impact of alkylation compared to chemical synthesis and facilitates regio&#8208; and chemoselective alkyl chain transfer. Here, we address the limiting factor for SAM synthesis, methionine supply, to accelerate in vivo methylation activity. Introduction of the direct sulfurylation pathway, consisting of O&#8208;acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase (ScOAHS) and O&#8208;acetyltransferase (ScMET2), from S. cerevisiae into E. coli and supplementation with methanethiol or the corresponding disulfide improves atom&#8208;economic methylation activity in three different MT reactions. Up to 17&#8208;fold increase of conversion compared to the sole expression of the MT and incorporation of up to 79&#8201;% of the thiol compound added were achieved. Promiscuity of ScOAHS allowed in vivo production of methionine analogues from organic thiols. Further co&#8208;overproduction of a methionine adenosyltransferase yielded SAM analogues which were further transferred by MTs onto different substrates. For methylation of non&#8208;physiological substrates, conversion rates up to 73&#8201;% were achieved, with an isolated yield of 41&#8201;% for N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;aminonitrophenol. The here described technique enables E. coli to become a biotechnological host for improved methylation and selective alkylation reactions.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Dynamic Supramolecular Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomer Induced Uniform Li+ Transport and Stabilizes Interphase Ensures Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive poly(urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) exhibits uniform soft and hard phases, where the hard phase promptly dissociates LiTFSI. The dissociated Li+ migrates uniformly through the soft phase, while TFSI&#8722; decomposes, forming a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase. The DSIPI significantly improved the performance of lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Artificial polymer solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with microphase&#8208;separated structures provide promising solutions to the inhomogeneity and cracking issues of natural SEIs in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, achieving homogeneous ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and superior interfacial stability remains challenging due to interference from hard&#8208;phase domains in ion transport and solid&#8208;solid interface issues with lithium metal. Herein, we present a dynamic supramolecular ion&#8208;conducting poly (urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) that achieves these three properties through modulating the hard&#8208;phase domains and constructing a composite SEI in situ. The soft&#8208;phase polytetrahydrofuran backbone, featuring loose Li+&#8722;O coordinating interactions, ensures uniform Li+ transport. Concurrently, sextuple hydrogen bonds in the hard phase dissipate strain energy through sequential bond cleavage, thereby imparting exceptional mechanical properties. Moreover, enriched bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) in DSIPI promotes the in situ formation of a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic composite SEI during cycling. Consequently, the DSIPI&#8208;protected lithium anode (DSIPI@Li) enables symmetric cells with exceptional cyclability exceeding 4,000&#8197;hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thereby demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, DSIPI@Li facilitates stable operation of the pouch cells under the constraints of a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing artificial SEIs and high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence with Bis&#8208;pyclen Yb(III) Chelates: Crown vs. Linear Polyether Linkers in Discrete Heteropolynuclear Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design and synthesis of pre&#8208;organized ligands combining two lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen macrocycles bridged by either a flexible linear pegylated linker (L2) or a bulkier K22 crown&#8208;ether (L3), and the regioselective formation of their dinuclear Yb complexes. Upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb upon excitation into the Yb NIR absorption band was evaluated in D2O, showing the heteropolynuclear complexes of L2 to be two times more intense for UC emission compared to those of L3.







Abstract
Ligands combining two lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclens were synthesized, using a flexible linear pegylated linker (L2) or a bulkier K22 crown&#8208;ether (L3). A functionalized pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen (L1) was also prepared as a mononuclear analogue. Coordination behavior of lanthanide cations was studied via NMR titration with Lu for L1, and UV/Vis and luminescence spectroscopy with Yb for L2/L3. Strong coordination of two Yb atoms enabled isolation and spectroscopic characterization of dinuclear complexes in H2O and D2O. Excited state lifetime analysis at 980&#8197;nm revealed strong protection of Yb cations, with no coordinated water molecule. Upon titration of the isolated dinuclear Yb complexes with Tb cations, cooperative upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb in the visible was observed upon excitation of Yb at 980&#8197;nm in D2O. In the absence of Tb, the Yb complexes also exhibited cooperative luminescence with a weak emission band around 500&#8197;nm upon NIR Yb excitation. Efficient UC with Tb was only observed after thermal treatment, suggesting a slow kinetic of formation of the UC species. [Yb2TbL3] showed weak Tb centered UC emission, while the dinuclear complex of L2 displayed more intense UC emission up to two equivalents of Tb, forming [(Yb2L2)Tbx] (x=1&#8211;2), with the tetranuclear heterometallic complex being the most intense emitter. Log&#8208;Log plot analysis confirmed the two&#8208;photon nature of the UC process.

Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane comprising a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) macrocyclic component and a thread containing three recognition sites: ammonium (AmH+), bipyridinium (Bpy2+) and triazolium (Trz+). AmH+ and Bpy2+ are responsive to fully orthogonal stimuli, pH and electrochemical, which allows to precisely control the directional translation of the macrocycle along the axle. A better understanding of the processes driving the operation of the system was obtained thanks to an in&#8208;depth thermodynamic characterization. Orthogonal stimuli responsive tristable rotaxanes represent the starting point for the creation of linear motors and the development of molecular logic gates.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nanohelixes Driven by Host&#8208;Guest Interactions and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an achiral AIEgen driven by host&#8211;guest interactions and Ag(I) coordination gave rise to well&#8208;defined nanohelixes, where the &#8220;contortion sites&#8221; produced by pillararenes enabled the helicity. Boosted luminescence and enhanced ROS productivity were achieved, allowing for applications in bacteria imaging and photodynamic antibacterial activities.







Abstract
Helical nanostructures fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of artificial motifs have been a captivating subject because of their structural aesthetics and multiple functionalities. Herein, we report the facile construction of a self&#8208;assembled nanohelix (NH) by leveraging an achiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen (G) and pillar[5]arene (H), driven by host&#8211;guest interactions and metal coordination. Inspired by the &#8220;sergeants and soldiers&#8221; effect and &#8220;majority rule&#8221; principle, the host&#8211;guest complexation between G and H is employed to fixate the twisted conformation of G for the generation of &#8220;contortion sites&#8221;, which further induced the emergence of helicity as the 1D assemblies are formed via Ag(I) coordination and hexagonally packed into nano&#8208;sized fibers. The strategy has proved feasible in both homogeneous and heterogeneous syntheses. Along with the formation of NH, boosted luminescence and enhanced productivity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are afforded because of the efficient restriction on G, indicating the concurrent regulation of NH&#8242;s morphology and photophysical properties by supramolecular assembly. In addition, NH also exhibits the capacity for bacteria imaging and photodynamic antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli).

         <title>Simultaneous Structural and Electronic Engineering on Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;co&#8208;doped SrTiO3 for Promoting Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid (template)&#8208;molten (dopants) reaction was employed to synthesize Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh) photocatalyst particles. The structure and electronic configuration of SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh were precisely engineered, resulting in the generation of high&#8208;concentration, long&#8208;lived free electrons. When used for photocatalytic H2 evolution, SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh achieved an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, setting a new benchmark among Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO3&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
Activating metal ion&#8208;doped oxides as visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts requires intricate structural and electronic engineering, a task with inherent challenges. In this study, we employed a solid (template)&#8208;molten (dopants) reaction to synthesize Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh) particles. Our investigation reveals that SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh manifests as single&#8208;crystalline particles in a core (undoped)/shell (doped) structure. Furthermore, it exhibits a well&#8208;stabilized Rh3+ energy state for visible&#8208;light response without introducing undesirable trapping states. This precisely engineered structure and electronic configuration promoted the generation of high&#8208;concentration and long&#8208;lived free electrons, as well as facilitated their transfer to cocatalysts for H2 evolution. Impressively, SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh achieved an exceptional apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, setting a new benchmark among Rh&#8208;doped&#8208;based SrTiO3 materials. Furthermore, when integrated into an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme system with Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 and reduced graphene oxide, SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh enabled water splitting with an AQY of 7.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. This work underscores the significance of simultaneous structural and electronic engineering and introduces the solid&#8208;molten reaction as a viable approach for this purpose.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte incorporating 1,3&#8208;propanesultone additive has been developed to form a highly ion&#8208;conductive and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This innovation significantly enhances the performance and stability of lithium metal batteries in wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000&#8197;h at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000&#8197;cycles, retention: 67&#8201;%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.

         <title>Pioneering Built&#8208;In Interfacial Electric Field for Enhanced Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

The Ni3N@W5N4 nano&#8208;heterostructure catalyst, with built&#8208;in interfacial electric field and ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells, significantly enhances alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics involved in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis by reducing energy barriers and demonstrating excellent performance and stability.







Abstract
As a half&#8208;reaction in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) technology, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is severely hindered by the sluggish reaction kinetics involved in additional water dissociation step, which results in large overpotentials and low energy conversion efficiency. Here, we develop a nano&#8208;heterostructure composed of ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells over Ni3N nanoparticles (Ni3N@W5N4) as efficient catalysts, in which built&#8208;in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is created owing to the distinct lattice arrangements and work functions of biphasic metal nitrides. The BIEF facilitates the electron localization around the interface and enables high valence W and more exposed binding sites in the surface W5N4 shell for accelerating the water dissociation step, ultimately leading to a remarkable reduction in the energy barriers of RDS from 1.40&#8197;eV to 0.26&#8197;eV. Theoretical calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis results demonstrated that surface W5N4 serves as the active species for HER. Moreover, the ultra&#8208;thin shell characteristics enable the optimized W5N4 with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity to be fully exposed as active sites. Consequently, the Ni3N@W5N4 exhibits exceptional performance in alkaline HER (60&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable long&#8208;term stability (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;hours). When employed as the cathode in the AEMWE device, the synthesized Ni3N@W5N4 demonstrates stable performance for 90&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>When Metal Complexes Evolve, and a Minor Species is the Most Active: the Case of Bis(Phenanthroline)Copper in the Catalysis of Glutathione Oxidation and Hydroxyl Radical Generation</title>

The CuII&#8208;Phen2 complex evolves in the presence of glutathione (GSH) forming mostly CuI&#8208;GSH clusters and minor GS&#8208;CuI&#8208;Phen species responsible for the prooxidant activity. The higher population of this species at the acidic pH of lysosomes fastens GSH oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in vitro. Consistently, the inhibition of lysosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 (Baf&#8208;A1) decreases the cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Phen2 in cancer cells.







Abstract
Several copper&#8208;ligands, including 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), have been investigated for anticancer purposes based on their capacity to bind excess copper (Cu) in cancer tissues and form redox active complexes able to catalyse the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Glutathione (GSH) is a critical compound as it is highly concentrated intracellularly and can reduce and dissociate copper(II) from the ligand forming poorly redox&#8208;active copper(I)&#8208;thiolate clusters. Here we report that Cu&#8208;Phen2 speciation evolves in physiologically relevant GSH concentrations. Experimental and computational experiments suggest that at pH&#160;7.4 mostly copper(I)&#8208;GSH clusters are formed, but a minor species of copper(I) bound to one Phen and forming ternary complexes with GSH (GS&#8722;Cu&#8208;Phen) is the redox active species, oxidizing quite efficiently GSH to GSSG and forming HO&#8901; radicals. This minor active species becomes more populated at lower pH, such as typical lysosomal pH&#160;5, resulting in faster GSH oxidation and HO&#8901; production. Consistently, cell culture studies showed lower toxicity of Cu&#8208;Phen2 upon inhibition of lysosomal acidification. Overall, this study underscores that sub&#8208;cellular localisation can considerably influence the speciation of Cu&#8208;based drugs and that minor species can be the most redox&#8208; and biologically&#8208;active.

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier Lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tunable intraband defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir in WO3&#8211;x/In2S3 S&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions, effectively prolonging charge carrier lifetime through rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons. Furthermore, it unlocks the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, facilitating H2O photooxidation and thereby boosting CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Tailoring Copper Single&#8208;Atoms&#8208;Stabilized Metastable Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dichalcogenides for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>

The Cu ions, etched from the Cu1.94S template, can be adsorbed onto the surface of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs in single atomic form, effectively stabilizing the metastable phase stability of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs and enabling sustainable ampere&#8208;level electrochemical hydrogen production.







Abstract
Unconventional 1T&#8242; phase transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, they are susceptible to transitioning into the stable 2H phase, which reduces their catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we present a scalable approach for designing thermally stable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs hollow structures (HSs) by etching Cu1.94S templates from pre&#8208;synthesized Cu1.94S@TMDs heterostructures, including 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 HSs. Furthermore, taking 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs as an example, the etched Cu ions can be firmly adsorbed on their surface in the form of single atoms (SAs) through Cu&#8722;S bonds, thereby elevating the phase transition temperature from 149&#8201;&#176;C to 373&#8201;&#176;C. Due to the advantages conferred by the 1T&#8242; phase, hollow structure, and synergistic effect between Cu SAs and 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 supports, the fabricated 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs demonstrate superior HER performance. Notably, their high&#8208;phase stability enables continuous operation of designed 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs for up to 200&#8197;hours at an ampere&#8208;level current density without significant activity decay. This work provides a universal method for synthesizing highly stable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs electrocatalysts, with a particular focus on the relationship between their phase and catalytic stability.

Due to the advantages conferred by the 1T&#8242; phase, hollow structure, and synergistic effect between Cu SAs and 1T&#8242;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supports, the fabricated 1T&#8242;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; HSs demonstrate superior HER performance. Notably, their high-phase stability enables continuous operation of designed 1T&#8242;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; HSs for up to 200&#8197;hours at an ampere-level current density without significant activity decay. This work provides a universal method for synthesizing highly stable 1T&#8242;-TMDs electrocatalysts, with a particular focus on the relationship between their phase and catalytic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Stabilization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme Enables Efficient Evolution of New Function</title>

The deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. A stabilized redesigned enzyme can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction.







Abstract
Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6&#8208;fold activity increase from the wild&#8208;type parent and an 80&#8208;fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/&#945;KG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user&#8208;friendly and widely accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning&#8208;based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Synthesis of Allylic Sulfenamides from Vinyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds by a Rearrangement Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route for enantioselective allylic sulfilimine rearrangement has been developed with sulfenamides and vinyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds, rather than direct imidation of sulfides. A wide range of allyl sulfenamides can be obtained and readily transformed into sulfinamides and &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives. DFT calculations demonstrate an ion pair mechanism and a formal 2,3&#8208;rearrangement process via a quasi&#8208;five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring transition state.







Abstract
The asymmetric rearrangement of allylic sulfilimines is an effective route to synthetically attractive targets, such as allylic sulfenamides. The current methods are limited to chirality transfer from chiral allylic sulfilimine precursors. Herein, we report a general and fundamentally new rearrangement route to access optically enriched allylic sulfenamides and their derivatives. The process involves S&#8208;alkylation and an unusual S&#8208;to&#8208;N rearrangement step. A chiral nickel complex enables the transformation of a broad scope of sulfenamides and vinyl &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides under mild conditions. Various allylic sulfenamides have been synthesized with excellent &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, and can be efficiently converted into sulfinamide and 4&#8208;aminobutenoic acid derivatives. In addition, DFT calculations demonstrate the connection between the spin state and conformation of the nickel vinyl carbenoid, as well as an unknown rearrangement process.

         <title>Asymmetric Coupled Binuclear&#8208;Site Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature Selective Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 12 asymmetric coupled heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) has been meticulously engineered on TiO2 using a passivation&#8208;tailored electrostatic anchorage strategy. Specifically, the asymmetric Pt1&#8722;Pd1 binuclear sites within Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2 have synergistically promoted the low&#8208;temperature selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation through a bifunctional catalytic route, significantly outperforming their mononuclear counterparts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous metal catalysts with bifunctional active sites are widely used in chemical industries. Although their improvement process is typically based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, it is hindered by the lack of model catalysts. Herein, we report an effective vacancy&#8208;pair capturing strategy to fabricate 12 heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) comprising combinations of transition metals on titania. During the synthesis of these HBSCs, proton&#8208;passivation treatment and step&#8208;by&#8208;step electrostatic anchorage enabled the suppression of single&#8208;atom formation and the successive capture of two target metal cations on the titanium&#8211;oxygen vacancy&#8208;pair site. Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20&#8201;&#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single&#8208;atom counterparts (e.g., Pd1&#8722;TiO2). Furthermore, the Pt1Pd1 binuclear sites in Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2 were demonstrated to catalyze C2H2 hydrogenation via a bifunctional active&#8208;site mechanism: initially C2H2 chemisorb on the Pt1 site, then H2 dissociates and migrates from Pd1 to Pt1, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt1&#8722;Pd1 interface.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Induced Phase Control Synthesis of Multi&#8208;dimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 Heteronanostructures via Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide induced phase control method for synthesizing multidimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanostructures via cation exchange, which successfually affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of cation exchange reactions. However, the crystal structure of Co3S4 is fail to form from similar cation exchange reactions of Cu1.94S.







Abstract
Phase control over cation exchange (CE) reactions has emerged as an important approach for the synthesis of nanomaterials (NMs), enabling precise determination of their reactivity and properties. Although factors such as crystal structure and morphology have been studied for the phase engineering of CE reactions in NMs, there remains a lack of systematic investigation to reveal the impact for the factors in heterogeneous materials. Herein, we report a molybdenum disulfide induced phase control method for synthesizing multidimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanostructures (HNs) via cation exchange. MoS2 in parent Cu1.94S&#8208;MoS2 HNs are proved to affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of CE reactions, and facilitate the formation of Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs with controlled phase. This MoS2 induced phase control method can be extended to other parent HNs with multiple dimensions, which shows its diversity. Further, theoretical calculations demonstrate that Co3S4 (111)/MoS2 (001) exhibits a higher adhesion work, providing further evidence that MoS2 enables phase control in the HNs CE reactions, inducing the generation of novel Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for crystal phase&#8208; and dimensionality&#8208;dependent of cobalt sulfide based HNs, the obtained Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanoplates (HNPls) show remarkable performance in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) under alkaline media. This synthetic methodology provides a unique design strategy to control the crystal structure and fills the gap in the study of heterogeneous materials on CE reaction over phase engineering that are otherwise inaccessible.

MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parent Cu&lt;sub&gt;1.94&lt;/sub&gt;S-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; HNs are proved to affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of CE reactions, and facilitate the formation of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; HNs with controlled phase. This MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced phase control method can be extended to other parent HNs with multiple dimensions, which shows its diversity. Further, theoretical calculations demonstrate that Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (111)/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (001) exhibits a higher adhesion work, providing further evidence that MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables phase control in the HNs CE reactions, inducing the generation of novel Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; HNs. As a proof-of-concept application for crystal phase- and dimensionality-dependent of cobalt sulfide based HNs, the obtained Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteronanoplates (HNPls) show remarkable performance in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) under alkaline media. This synthetic methodology provides a unique design strategy to control the crystal structure and fills the gap in the study of heterogeneous materials on CE reaction over phase engineering that are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we have developed a NiFelDH&#8208;FLPs electrocatalyst based on frustrated Lewis acidic&#8208;basic pairs (FLPs) for seawater oxidation for the first time. Based on the soft hard acid&#8208;base theory, the Lewis acidic sites of FLPs exhibit a strong affinity for OH&#8722;, while the Lewis basic sites demonstrate resistance to Cl&#8722;. Consequently, during the process of seawater electrolysis, the ClOR on the catalyst surface are effectively inhibited due to the existence of FLPs sites.







Abstract
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8722; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers for selective seawater oxidation. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce&#8197;4&#8201;f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Ni&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8722;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. The assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can stably operate for 250&#8197;hours at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work examines how steaming affects the material&#8216;s properties and influences the organic reaction mechanism in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol conversion process.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.&#8201;g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.

Flexible wide&#8208;temperature ZIBs based on ternary eutectic electrolyte (ZBL) with satisfactory performance and outstanding cycling stability from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted attention for grid applications due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high security. However, their lifespan decreases at high temperatures due to declining interfacial stability and increased side reactions. To address these challenges, a ternary deep eutectic solvent&#8208;based flexible electrolyte, comprised of Zn(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, butanedinitrile (BD), and LiCl in an amphoteric polymer matrix, was developed to enable wide&#8208;temperature ZIBs working from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 70&#8201;&#176;C. The interactions among BD, Li+, and zinc hydrate alongside the amphoteric groups on the polyelectrolyte matrix could effectively suppress the interfacial side reactions and Zn dendrites formation. Consequently, the symmetric Zn cell demonstrates exceptional stability across a wide&#8208;temperature range, with the ability to survive up to 2780&#8197;hours (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the flexible Zn||PANI battery can operate stably over 1000 cycles at 50&#8201;&#176;C, boasting an initial specific capacity of 124.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and capacity retention rate of 87.9&#8201;% (3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work presents an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;stability energy storage devices with excellent security features that can function reliably across diverse temperature conditions.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Switching of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Norbornadienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient energy storage system using underexplored sensitization strategies has been developed. Quantitative conversion and maximum isomerization quantum yields of aryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes to the stable quadricyclane counterpart with exceptional energy storage capabilities are achieved, while harvesting photons from the solar spectrum efficiently.







Abstract
Norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches have emerged as promising candidates for harnessing and storing solar energy, holding great promise as a viable solution to meet the growing energy demands. Despite their potential, the effectiveness of their direct photochemical conversion into the resulting quadricyclanes has room for improvement owing to (i) moderate quantum yields, (ii) poor overlap with the solar spectrum and (iii) photochemical back reactions. Herein, we present an approach to enhance the performance of such molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems through the triplet&#8208;sensitized conversion of aryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes. Our study combines deep spectroscopic analyses, irradiation experiments, and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the energy transfer mechanism and inherent advantages of the resulting MOST systems. We demonstrate remarkable quantum yields using readily available sensitizers under both LED and solar light irradiation, significantly surpassing those achieved through direct excitation with photons of higher energy. In contrast to the conventional approach, light&#8208;induced back reactions of the high&#8208;energy products do not play any role, allowing quantitative switching within minutes. These results not only underscore the potential of triplet&#8208;sensitized MOST systems to leverage the high energy storage capabilities of multistate photoswitches but they might also stimulate the broader usage of sensitization strategies in photochemical energy conversion.

Herein, we present an approach to enhance the performance of such molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems through the triplet-sensitized conversion of aryl-substituted norbornadienes. Our study combines deep spectroscopic analyses, irradiation experiments, and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the energy transfer mechanism and inherent advantages of the resulting MOST systems. We demonstrate remarkable quantum yields using readily available sensitizers under both LED and solar light irradiation, significantly surpassing those achieved through direct excitation with photons of higher energy. In contrast to the conventional approach, light-induced back reactions of the high-energy products do not play any role, allowing quantitative switching within minutes. These results not only underscore the potential of triplet-sensitized MOST systems to leverage the high energy storage capabilities of multistate photoswitches but they might also stimulate the broader usage of sensitization strategies in photochemical energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multivalent Weak Protections Ultimately Enable Customizable DNA Grafting on Pristine Ag Colloids for Nanoplasmonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent weak bindings of DNA's bases on pristine Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) overcome AgNPs&#8217; notorious problems of poor colloidal stability and easy oxidative leaching. This success helps surmount a historical barrier in valence/density&#8208;tunable DNA grafting of AgNPs via the simplest Ag&#8722;S bonding. DNA&#8208;programmed assemblies involving AgNPs are realized with strong plasmonic coupling, enhanced Raman scattering, and a possibly Fano&#8208;induced feature.







Abstract
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have superior plasmonic properties surpassing other metals. However, a long&#8208;standing difficulty in valence/density&#8208;tunable DNA grafting of AgNPs disfavors their use in DNA&#8208;directed nanoplasmonics. Herein a close&#8208;to&#8208;ideal surface protection of pristine AgNPs against various notorious stability issues of Ag is achieved based on multidentate weak nucleobase bindings of non&#8208;programming FSDNA (fish sperm DNA). This further allows grafting of thiolated DNA with tunable valence/density on AgNPs. The end&#8208;on format of the thiolated DNA grafts and the very thin FSDNA layer benefit DNA hybridization and plasmon coupling, respectively. Significantly promoted optical coupling and Raman enhancing are achieved. The compatibility of FSDNA&#8208;capped AgNPs with Au enables DNA&#8208;bonded symmetry&#8208;broken Au&#8722;Ag heterodimers with strong near&#8208;field coupling and an easily seen Fano&#8208;induced feature. Our work provides a treasured freedom of using AgNPs in DNA&#8208;programmed, better&#8208;behaving plasmonic devices.

         <title>Customizing H2O&#8208;Poor Electric Double Layer and Boosting Texture Exposure of Zn (101) Plane towards Super&#8208;High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All Experimental results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that a H2O&#8208;poor&#160;electrical double layer and preferential exposure of unconventional Zn (101) facet is acquired by adopting a small amount of malate molecules as an electrolyte additive, leading to homogeneous dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and achieving high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The catastrophic dendrite hyperplasia and parasitic reactions severely impede the future deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Controlling zinc orientation growth is considered to be an effective method to overcome the aforementioned concerns, especially for regulating the (002) plane of deposited Zn. Unfortunately, Zn (002) texture is difficult to obtain stable cycling under high deposition capacity resulting from its large lattice distortion and nonuniform distribution in electric field. Herein, different from traditional cognition, a crystallization orientation regulation tactic is proposed to boost Zn (101) texture exposure and inhibit zinc dendrite proliferation during plating/stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate the malate molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn (002) facet, leading to the texture exposure of distinctive Zn (101) plane. Meanwhile, the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups of malate molecules exhibit strong adsorption on the Zn anode surface and chelate with Zn2+, achieving H2O&#8208;poor electrical double layer. Very impressively, the multifunctional malate additive enlists zinc anode to survive for 600&#8197;h under a harsh condition of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/15&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the symmetric cell harvests highly&#8208;reversible cycling life of 6600&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkably outperforming the ZnSO4 electrolyte. The assembled Zn//MnO2 full cells also demonstrate prominent electrochemical reversibility.

         <title>A Versatile Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Pillared Interlayer Design for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based multifunctional interlayer membrane was fabricated for simultaneously enhancing the redox kinetics of cathode and suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites on anode, which enabled superior electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is a promising way to attain higher energy density at a lower cost beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion battery technology. However, the major issues impeding their practical applications are the sluggish kinetics and the parasitic shuttling reactions of sulfur and polysulfides. Here, pillaring the multilayer graphene membrane with a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) demonstrates the substantial impact of a versatile interlayer design in tackling these issues. Unlike regular composite separators reported so far, the participation of tri&#8208;metallic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn MOF as pillars supports the construction of an ion&#8208;channel interconnected interlayer structure, unexpectedly balancing the interfacial concentration polarization, spatially confining the soluble polysulfides, and vastly affording the lithiophilic sites for highly efficient polysulfide sieving/conversion. As a demonstration, we show that the MOF&#8208;pillared interlayer structure enables outstanding capacity (1634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C) and longevity (average capacity decay of 0.034&#8201;% per cycle in 2000&#8197;cycles) for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Besides, the multilayer separator can be readily integrated into the high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.91Mn0.03Co0.06O2)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which efficiently suppresses the undesired phase evolution upon cycling. These findings suggest the potential of &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; materials in fabricating multi&#8208;functional separators, bringing forward the pillared interlayer structure for energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Polymer Gel Electrolyte towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Fiber Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one polydopamine chemistry&#8208;regulated gel electrolyte is designed to enhance both the anode reversibility and cathode kinetics of fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a novel strategy for developing flexible metal&#8208;air batteries with extended lifespan and high energy efficiency.







Abstract
Fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries are explored as promising power systems for wearable and portable electronic devices due to their intrinsic safety and the use of ambient oxygen as cathode material. However, challenges such as limited zinc anode reversibility and sluggish cathode reaction kinetics result in poor cycling stability and low energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we design a polydopamine&#8208;based all&#8208;in&#8208;one gel electrolyte (PAGE) that simultaneously regulates the reversibility of zinc anodes and the kinetics of air cathodes through polydopamine interfacial and redox chemistry, respectively. The intrinsic catechol and carboxylate groups in PAGE regulate the transport and solvation structure of Zn2+, facilitating dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with a lamellar stacking morphology. Additionally, the oxidation of redox&#8208;active catechol groups in PAGE replaces the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction on the air cathode and reduces the energy barrier for charging, enabling fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries to achieve a significantly improved energy efficiency of 95&#8201;% and a longer lifespan of 40&#8197;hours. Further integration into self&#8208;powered electronic textiles underscores its potential for next&#8208;generation wearable systems.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Anchored Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt (PIS) composite solid electrolyte strategy. In this system, Zn2+ decouple from polymer chains and migrate through ionic clusters via a hopping mechanism. The addition of Nb2O5&#8208;x enhances the mechanical strength of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancies anchor anions, significantly increase ion transference numbers, reduce concentration polarization, and achieve uniform zinc ion deposition.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes hold promise for addressing key challenges in rechargeable zinc batteries (ZBs) utilizing aqueous electrolytes. However, achieving simultaneous high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and a high cation transference number while effectively suppressing Zn dendrites remains challenging. Herein, we design a novel polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and niobium pentoxide with oxygen vacancies (Nb2O5&#8208;x) with high ionic conductivity. PAN polymer matrix provides the electrolyte good mechanical properties and solubility of Zn salt. The high concentration of ZnCl2 effectively decouples the Zn2+ from polymer chain segments and provides more ionic conduction amorphous region. Moreover, incorporating Nb2O5&#8208;x filler accelerates Zn2+ desolvation by anchoring (ZnxCly)2x&#8211;y clusters and enhances the system's mechanical properties, achieving a superior Zn2+ transference number (~0.93) and interfacial stability. Consequently, the optimized PISSE demonstrates exceptional stability during prolonged cycling periods, wide temperature range operation (&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C), remarkable flexibility, and compatibility with diverse electrode materials. This study provides valuable insights into the design of solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on ZBs and elucidates their multifunctional prospects.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Group Metal High&#8208;Entropy Selenides for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fabrication of a high&#8208;entropy selenide (HE&#8208;Se) nanostructure consisting of five platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs), namely Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt, was realized by liquid&#8208;phase chemical synthesis. The material exhibits a unique amorphous structure and can be crsytallized into HE&#8208;Se with a cubic structure by thermal annealing. The advantages of high&#8208;entropy configuration and amorphous structure was demonstrated in hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The selenides of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) are emerging as promising catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions. To date, most studies have focused on single metal or bimetallic systems, whereas the preparation of a high&#8208;entropy (HE) selenide consisting of five or more PGM elements holds the promise to further enhance catalytic performance by introducing abundant active sites with various local coordination environments and electronic structures. Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of PGM&#8208;based HE&#8208;Selenide (HE&#8208;Se) nanoparticles with a unique amorphous structure. The atomic metal&#8211;Se coordination and the presence of short&#8208;range order were thoroughly revealed. It is further shown that the amorphous HE&#8208;Se can be facilely transformed into a single&#8208;phase crystalline HE&#8208;Se with a cubic structure by thermal annealing. Catalytically, the amorphous HE&#8208;Se showed better acidic hydrogen evolution activity over monometallic PGM&#8208;based selenides and the crystalline counterpart, demonstrating the advantages of high&#8208;entropy configuration and amorphous structure. Our findings may pave the way toward the synthesis and property exploration of amorphous PGM&#8208;based selenides with tunable compositions.

         <title>Stereochemical Impacts on Acyclic Mechanochemical Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral acyclic mechanophore is used to study the role of stereochemistry on mechanochemical activation rate. The R,R/S,S benzopinacol enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster than the meso R,S diastereomer. DFT modeling suggests that the two hydroxyl groups syn to each other form an improving hydrogen&#8208;bond as the mechanophore is pulled. This bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl groups are forced to be anti to each other.







Abstract
The influence of stereochemistry on the mechanochemistry rate is studied using a new mechanophore based on a benzopinacol (BP) skeleton. Two sets of BP diastereomers, the meso R,S and the R,R/S,S were isolated, incorporated into the center of a poly(methyl acrylate), and their mechanical activation rate was measured in solution. Under mechanical stress, the central C&#8722;C bond in BP is cleaved, providing two independent benzophenone molecules with higher UV&#8208;absorption coefficient at 254&#8197;nm. Monitoring the reaction rate spectroscopically indicates that the chiral R,R/S,S enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster compared to the meso R,S diastereomer. In&#8208;silico modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond between the syn hydroxyls in the R,R diastereomer becomes shorter with stress, reducing the maximal force required for C&#8722;C bond scission, while this bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl are anti to each other. Our results indicate that in polymer where free rotation around bonds is possible, non&#8208;covalent interactions between backbone substituents, which are affected by relative stereochemistry, can play a fundamental role in the mechanochemical stability of the polymer.

         <title>Selective Methylation of Cyclic Ether Towards Highly Elastic Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Silicon&#8208;based Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) shifts ring&#8208;opening polymerization from bulk to interface, creating an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for silicon anodes. 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL), with higher ring strain and hyperconjugation, forms high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers in the SEI. This flexible, elastic interface accommodates silicon&#8216;s volume changes, enhancing electrochemical stability and long&#8208;term performance.







Abstract
Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high theoretical capacity for lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume changes and continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation. Here, we address these challenges by selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), thus shifting the unstable bulk polymerization to controlled interfacial reactions and resulting in a highly elastic SEI. Comparative studies of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (2MDOL) and 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL) reveal that 4MDOL, with its larger ring strain and more stable radical intermediates due to hyperconjugation effect, promotes the formation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymeric species at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This elastic, polymer&#8208;rich SEI effectively accommodates volume changes of Si and inhibits continuous side reactions. Our designed electrolyte enables Si&#8208;based anode to achieve 85.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C without additives, significantly outperforming conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Full cells also demonstrate stable long&#8208;term cycling. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance Si anodes, offering a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced energy density and longevity.

         <title>Electrochemically Gated Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry in Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical control of frustrated Lewis pair chemistry of single boron cluster junctions is observed in electric double layer at a single&#8208;molecule level by using in situ STM break junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The recent discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) during the activation of small molecules has inspired extensive research across the full span of chemical science. Owing to the nature of weak interactions, it is experimentally challenging to directly observe and modulate FLP at the molecular scale. Here we design a boron cluster anion building block (B10H82&#8722;) and organic amine cations ([NR4]+, R=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;C2H5) as the FLP to prove the feasibility of controlling their interaction in the electric double layer (EDL) via an electrochemical strategy. In situ single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements and Raman monitoring of B10H82&#8722;&#8722;[NR4]+ FLP formed at the positively charged Au(111) electrode surface, in contrast to the free&#8208;standing B10H82&#8722; near or below the potential of zero charge (PZC). Furthermore, this FLP chemistry leads to a shift in the local density of states of boron clusters towards the EF for enhancing electron transport, providing a new prototype of a reversible single&#8208;cluster switch that digitally switches upon controlling FLP chemistry in the electric double layer.

         <title>Allylic Epoxides Increase the Strain Energy of Cyclic Olefin Monomers for Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic olefins with allylic epoxides were found to have increased strain energies relative to their monocyclic counterparts, allowing for rapid ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at room temperature. The epoxides in the polymer backbone allowed for facile modification via nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an effective method for synthesizing functional polymers, but since the technique typically relies on high ring strain cyclic olefins, the most common monomers are norbornene derivatives. The reliance on one class of monomer limits the obtainable properties of ROMP polymers. In this work, we investigate new bicyclic monomers synthesized via epoxidation of commercial dienes. DFT estimates of these monomers&#8217; ring strains suggests a significant increase in strain for cyclic olefins containing allylic epoxides. We found that the eight&#8208;membered (3,4&#8208;COO) and five&#8208;membered (CPO) cyclic olefins were particularly effective for ROMP. CPO was of especially intriguing due to its excellent polymerizability when compared to the limited reactivity of other five&#8208;membered rings. Unlike polynorbornenes, the resulting polymers of both monomers displayed glass transition temperatures well below room temperature. Interestingly, poly(3,4&#8208;COO) showed both high stereo&#8208; and regioregularity while poly(CPO) showed little regularity. Both polymers could be readily modified via post&#8208;polymerization ring&#8208;opening of the reactive allylic epoxides. With a high epoxide density in poly(CPO), CPO is an exciting new ROMP monomer that is easily synthesized, can be polymerized to high conversion at room temperature, and may be facilely modified to yield a wide range of functional materials.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Fe&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks for Mutually Enhanced Mild Photothermal Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Fe&#8208;based MQNs were fabricated via a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. Upon NIR irradiation, FTP MQNs triggered efficient MPTT to induce apoptosis and potentiated Fenton reaction and GSH exhaustion to boost the potency of ferroptosis. Additionly, the reinforced ferroptosis in turn relieved the thermos resistance by impairment of the protective HSPs and ATP levels reduction.







Abstract
Mild photothermal therapy (MPTT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for attenuating thermal damage to the normal tissues surrounding tumors, while the heat&#8208;induced upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) greatly compromises the curative efficacy of MPTT by increasing cellular thermo&#8208;tolerance. Ferroptosis has been identified to suppress the overexpression of HSPs by the accumulation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but is greatly restricted by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in tumor microenvironment and undesirable ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a synergistic strategy based on the mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis is proposed for cleaving HSPs to recover tumor cell sensitivity. A facile method for fabricating a series of Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) by coordinated assembly is proposed and the representative FTP MQNs possess high photothermal conversion efficiency (69.3&#8201;%). Upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, FTP MQNs not only trigger effective MPTT to induce apoptosis but more significantly, potentiate Fenton reaction and marked GSH consumption to boost ferroptosis, and the reinforced ferroptosis effect in turn can alleviate the thermal resistance by declining the HSP70 defense and reducing ATP levels. This study provides a valuable rationale for constructing a large library of MQNs for achieving mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis.

         <title>Stepwise One&#8208;Shot Borylation Reactions for Intersecting DABNA Substructures Exhibiting Bright Yellow&#8208;Green Electroluminescence with EQE Beyond 40&#8201;% and Mild Roll&#8208;Off</title>

A novel boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1, was synthesized through our proposed synthetic protocol of stepwise one&#8208;shot borylation reactions. It demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission. In an organic light&#8208;emitting diode, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1 achieves yellow&#8208;green electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiency of over 40&#8201;% and recorded&#8208;high current efficiency of ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Boron/nitrogen (B/N)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the multiple resonance (MR) effect are promising for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of their narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Nevertheless, exploring the variety of such emitters is challenging because of the tricky and limited synthetic protocols. Herein, we designed a novel B/N&#8208;doped PAH, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1, whose backbone (L&#8211;DABNA) could not be achieved via conventional routes (e.g., one&#8208;pot borylation or one&#8208;shot borylation). We successfully synthesized it through stepwise one&#8208;shot borylations with precisely introducing decorations. The unique MR backbone with intersecting DABNA substructures sharing an aniline group, avoiding any para&#8208;N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, allows L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1 to maintain narrowband TADF emission while significantly redshifting to the yellow&#8208;green region with a reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.28&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. An L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1&#8208;based OLED device achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% and maintained a high EQE of 36.3&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with a current efficiency reaching ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrated the great potential of stepwise borylations in synthesizing B/N&#8208;doped PAH backbones, expanding their chemical space, but also provided a promising pathway for exploring MR&#8208;TADF emitters at longer wavelengths.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Gold(I) Complex with Rotational Freedom: A Platform Integrating Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, Polymorphism, and Linearly Polarized Luminescence</title>

A new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;M&#8211;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT is developed to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent TADF and LPL properties are interpreted by the rotational flexibility of the linear two&#8208;coordination mode which permits various molecular packing arrangements.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes have been exploited for various applications. Herein, a new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;M&#8211;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT, using bulky pyrazine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PZI) and trioxytriphenylamine (TOT) ligands, was synthesized. PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT displays decent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with a quantum yield of 93&#8201;% in doped film. The crystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT show simultaneous TADF, polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent emission properties with widely varied peaks from 560 to 655&#8197;nm are attributed to different packing modes in terms of isolated monomers, discrete &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked dimers or dimer PLUS. Two well&#8208;defined microcrystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT exhibit linearly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence with a degree of polarization up to 0.64. This work demonstrates that the molecular rotational flexibility of D&#8211;M&#8211;A type complexes endows an integration of multiple functions into one complex through manipulation of supramolecular aggregation. This type of complexes is expected to serve as a versatile platform for the fabrication of crystal materials for advanced photonic applications.

         <title>Harnessing 4f Electron Itinerancy for Integrated Dual&#8208;Band Redox Systems Boosts Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving a balance between catalyst activity and stability is a critical challenge in catalysis. This study proposes the &#8220;electron itinerancy&#8221; mechanism, where the high&#8208;energy, localized f&#8208;bands of rare&#8208;earth elements couple with the broadened d&#8208;bands of transition metals. This creates a flexible &#8220;electron reservoir&#8221; for the reaction process, facilitating temporary storage for electron transfer for ORR and OER reactions.







Abstract
In&#8208;depth comprehension and manipulation of band occupation at metal centers are crucial for facilitating effective adsorption and electron transfer in lithium&#8208;oxygen battery (LOB) reactions. Rare earth elements play a unique role in band hybridization due to their deep orbitals and strong localization of 4&#8201;f electrons. Herein, we anchor single Ce atoms onto CoO, constructing a highly active and stable catalyst with d&#8208;f a dual&#8208;band redox center. It is discovered that the itinerant behavior of 4&#8201;f electrons introduces an enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which facilitates ideal &#963;/&#960; bonding and flexible adsorption between the Ce/Co active sites and *O. Simultaneously, the injection of localized Ce 4&#8201;f electrons strengthens the orbital bonding capacity of Co&#8722;O, effectively inhibits the dissolution of Co sites and improves the structural stability of the cathode material. Bracingly, the Ce1/CoO&#8208;based LOB exhibits an ultra&#8208;low charge&#8211;discharge polarization (0.46&#8197;V) and stable cyclic performance (1088&#8197;hours). This work breaks through the traditional limitations in catalyst activity and stability, providing new strategies and theoretical insights for developing high&#8208;performance LOBs powered by rare&#8208;earth elements.

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge Transfer Emitters Utilizing Hyperconjugation Effect Towards Solution&#8208;Processed Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency Approaching 12&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

Four solution&#8208;processable emitters utilizing hyperconjugation effect with a novel core structure spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2&#8242;&#8208;imidazole] were synthesized and their excited state characters were investigated by abundant theoretical calculations. The solution&#8208;processed OLEDs all achieved maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of higher than 8&#8201;%, wherein the device based on 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2&#8242;&#8208;imidazole] (NFIP&#8208;CZ) gained a record&#8208;high EQEmax of 11.94&#8201;% and a ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue CIE coordinate of (0.1581, 0.0422).







Abstract
Hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state materials, which possess weak donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) pure organic structures, deserve one of the most promising efficient and stable blue emitters. Through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, 75&#8201;% triplet excitons generated by electrical excitation could be harvested and utilized in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, there are still significant challenges to achieve high&#8208;efficiency ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters with low Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinate y values. Here, a series of novel blue HLCT emitters based on spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2&#8242;&#8208;imidazole] structure were designed and synthesized by fine&#8208;tuning the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2&#8242;&#8208;imidazole] core structure in our previous work through heteroatom substitution and hyperconjugation effect. The target emitters were endowed with excellent photophysical and electrochemical merits, thermal stability and solution processibility. The solution&#8208;processed OLED based on 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2&#8242;&#8208;imidazole] (NFIP&#8208;CZ) achieved efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y=0.1581, 0.0422) with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), maximum current efficiency (CEmax) and maximum power efficiency (PEmax) of 11.94&#8201;%, 4.07&#8197;cd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 2.56&#8197;lm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;W&#8722;1. The record EQE is a breakthrough in both solution&#8208;processed and vacuum vapor deposition ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue HLCT OLEDs currently.

         <title>Encapsulation of an Au25 Nanocluster inside a Porphyrin Nanoring Enhances Singlet Oxygen Generation and Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8208;guest system formed by binding atomically precise Au nanoclusters inside zinc porphyrin nanorings has been studied. The assembly is based on the interaction between the zinc porphyrin units and the pyridine ligands of the cluster. The assembly shows increased stability and (electro&#8722;)photo catalytic activities in CO2 reduction to CO and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation compared to the pristine cluster.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecular host&#8211;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.

         <title>Directly Regenerating of Spent LiCoO2 with Gradient F&#8208;Doped Subsurface towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Storage Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the existence of OVs, the diffusion energy barrier of F&#8208;elements is lowered. Thus, trace amounts of F&#8208;elements (0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) achieve the gradient doping on subsurface, establishing the rigid CoO5F layer. However, when introducing the high levels of F impurities (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%), the form LiF passivation layer leads to imperfect Li&#8208;ions supplementation and crystalline phase reconstruction.







Abstract
As great potential recycling strategy, the direct regeneration of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) is beneficial for lowering environmental pollutions and promoting global sustainability. However, owing to the using of binder and electrolyte, some fluorine impurities would be remained into spent materials. Considering the doping behaviors of F&#8208;elements, their suitable content introducing would facilitate the energy&#8208;storage abilities of regenerated LCO. Herein, through the tailored introduction of F&#8208;elements, spent LCO are successfully regenerated with physical&#8208;chemical evolutions. Benefitting from the existed oxygen vacancies, the diffusion energy&#8208;barrier of F&#8208;elements is reduced from 1.73&#8197;eV to 0.61&#8197;eV, facilitating the establishment of gradient F&#8208;doped subsurface, along with the formation of rigid CoO5F. Meanwhile, excess F&#8208;elements (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%, as a threshold) lead to the formation of LiF passivation layer on the surface. Thus, the as&#8208;optimized sample displays a considerable capacity of 154.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 5.0&#8197;C, with retention rate (88.3&#8201;%) in 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V. Supported by detailed electrochemical and kinetic analysis, the structural advantages are confirmed to boost the improved redox activity of Co&#8208;ions and the alleviating of irreversible oxygen&#8208;release. Give this, the work is anticipated to reveal the evolutions of regenerated LCO with the introduced F&#8208;elements, whilst providing the practical regeneration strategies toward excellent high&#8208;voltage properties.

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Discovery of the Molecular Basis for Biosynthesis of the Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitor Cerulenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerulenin is the first reported fatty acid synthase inhibitor, yet its biosynthesis has remained elusive for six decades. The biosynthetic gene cluster of cerulenin has now been uncovered from the genomes of two Sarocladium fungal species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining strategy. The gene cluster was validated by heterologous expression in A.&#8197;nidulans and cerulenin biosynthesis was elucidated using molecular biology approaches.







Abstract
Cerulenin (1) is the first reported natural fatty acid synthase inhibitor and has been intensively researched for its antifungal, anticancer and anti&#8208;obesity properties. However, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained a mystery for six decades. Here, we have identified the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster (cer) responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 from two Sarocladium species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining approach, which we validated via heterologous reconstitution of cer cluster in an Aspergillus nidulans host. Expression of various combinations of cer genes uncovered key pathway intermediates, electrocyclisation products derived from PKS&#8208;encoded polyenoic acids, and a suite of 13 new analogues of 1. This enabled us to establish a biosynthetic pathway to 1 that starts with a C12 polyketide precursor containing both E and Z double bonds and involves a complex series of epoxidations, double bond shifts, E/Z isomerisation and epoxide reduction. Using in vitro assays, we further validated the roles of amidotransferase CerD in amidation, and oxidase CerF and reductase CerE in the final two&#8208;electron oxidation and enone reduction steps towards 1. These findings expand our understanding of complex tailoring modifications in highly reducing PKS pathways and pave the way for the engineered biosynthesis of cerulenin analogues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Extraction of Precious Metals Using a Porphyrin&#8208;Integrated One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a porphyrin&#8208;integrated one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework was synthesized and applied to the recovery of precious metals, including gold, silver, and platinum. The adsorption and reduction of precious metal ions simultaneously proceeded to perform extremely high recovery efficiency, directly producing precious metal particles without further reduction or high&#8208;temperature treatment.







Abstract
Precious metals are valuable materials for the chemical industry, but they are scarce and pose a risk of supply disruption. Recycling precious metals from waste is a promising strategy, here we tactfully utilize light irradiation as an environmental&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;saving adjunctive strategy to promote the reduction of precious metal ions, thereby improving the adsorption capacity and kinetics. A newly light&#8208;sensitive covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF) was synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this light auxiliary strategy. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation towards gold, platinum, and silver ions are 4729, 573, and 519&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which are 3.3, 1.9, and 1.2&#8197;times the adsorption capacities under dark condition. Significantly, a filtration column with PP&#8208;COF can recover more than 99.8&#8201;% of the gold ions in the simulated e&#8208;waste leachates with light irradiation, and 1&#8197;gram of PP&#8208;COF can recover gold from up to 0.15&#8197;tonne of e&#8208;waste leachates. Interestingly, the captured precious metals by PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation mainly exist in the micron&#8208;sized particles, which can be easily separated by extraction. We believe this work can contribute to precious metal recovery and circular economy for recycling resources.

Abstract
Organic fluorophores with tunable &#960;&#8208;conjugated paths have attracted considerable attention owing to their diverse properties and promising applications. Herein, we present a tailored butterfly&#8208;like molecule, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(2,5&#8208;bis (2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)dinaphthalene (BDVPN), which exhibits diverse photophysical features in its two polymorphs. The BP phase crystal, with its &#8220;aligned wings&#8221; conformation, possesses emissive characteristics that are nearly identical to those in dilute solutions. In contrast, the BN phase crystal, which adopts an &#8220;orthogonal wings&#8221; conformation, exhibits an unusual hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission compared to its dilute solution counterparts. This intriguing hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission originates from the reduction in the effective conjugated length of the molecular skeleton. Notably, BN phase crystals also exhibit exceptional optical performance, featuring high&#8208;efficiency emission (76.6&#8201;%), low&#8208;loss optical waveguides (0.571&#8197;dB&#8201;mm&#8722;1), deep&#8208;blue amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM: 6.4&#8197;nm), and a unique 200&#8197;nm bathochromic shift of piezochromic luminescence.

Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) have been engineered. The atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and Ni dopant induce long&#8208;range lattice distortions and ligand effects, respectively. Due to their synergistic interplay, Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibit enhanced catalytic activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and exceptional durability for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Defect engineering is an effective strategy for regulating the electrocatalysis of nanomaterials, yet it is seldom considered for modulating Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we designed Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) with a low Pt loading of 3.5&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% and a Ni/Pt ratio of 0.038&#8201;:&#8201;1. Physical characterizations confirmed the presence of abundant atomic&#8208;scale vacancies in the Pt NPs induces long&#8208;range lattice distortions, and the Ni dopant generates a ligand effect resulting in electronic transfer from Ni to Pt. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicated that atomic&#8208;scale vacancies mainly contributed the tolerance performances towards CO and CH3OH, the ligand effect derived from a tiny of Ni dopant accelerated the transformation from *O to *OH species, thereby improved the ORR activity without compromising the tolerance capabilities. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay between atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and ligand effect, as&#8208;prepared Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibited improved ORR activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and excellent durability. This study offers a new avenue for modulating the electrocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;based nanomaterials.

A strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, leading to an advanced human somatosensory network analogous piezoionic skin.







Abstract
Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1&#8197;kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2&#8197;Pa with a fast response time of 18.1&#8197;ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate arrayed pressure sensing with a PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin, analogous to the human somatosensory network. These capabilities hold great promises for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.

         <title>Ultrabroad Near Infrared Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining emission from host self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) with dopant d&#8211;d transitions, we designed ultrabroad near infrared (NIR) emitting perovskites, 2.5&#8201;% W4+ and 2.8&#8201;% Mo4+&#8208;doped Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6. They exhibit exceptional spectral widths exceeding 450&#8197;nm with quantum yield ~40&#8201;%. Leveraging 3D printing technology, we fabricated robust phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) demonstrating NIR imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) have revolutionized solid&#8208;state white lighting by replacing energy&#8208;inefficient filament&#8208;based incandescent lamps. However, such a pc&#8208;LED emitting ultrabroad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiations still remains a challenge, primarily because of the lack of ultrabroad NIR emitting phosphors. To address this issue, we have prepared 2.5&#8201;% W4+&#8208;doped and 2.8&#8201;% Mo4+&#8208;doped Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 perovskites emitting ultrabroad NIR radiation with unprecedented spectral widths of 434 and 468&#8197;nm, respectively. Upon band&#8208;edge excitation, the soft lattice of the host exhibits broad self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission covering NIR&#8208;I (700&#8197;nm), which then nonradiatively excites the dopants.

The large spin&#8208;orbit coupling and local structural distortion might possibly enhance the dopant emission intensity, leading to an overall NIR photoluminescence quantum yield ~40&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymorphism in Cyanine H&#8208; and J&#8208;Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a novel cyanine dye with pendant rod&#8208;like groups that forms two distinct H&#8208; and J&#8208;type 2D supramolecular polymorphs in organic solvents. Uniquely, this 2D polymorphism arises not from different self&#8208;assembly processes but through different aggregate conversion events. This discovery highlights polymorph transformations as a powerful strategy for creating functional supramolecular systems in solution and in solid state.







Abstract
We designed a new cyanine dye 1, with two pedant rod&#8208;like groups, capable of forming two distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane; an H&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;H2) and a J&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;J). Importantly, these two polymorphs were not accessed through polymerization events, and instead through the thermal transformation of a third particle&#8208;like polymorph (Agg&#8208;H1) formed by the anti&#8208;cooperative assembly of 1. While Agg&#8208;H2 is generated upon cooling the solution of Agg&#8208;H1 by a thermoreversible polymorph transition, the Agg&#8208;J was obtained through a hidden pathway by combining sonication and cooling to the Agg&#8208;H1 solution. This is the first report on the obtention of H&#8208; and J&#8208;type cyanine polymorphs that in turn could be isolated in solid&#8208;state to render two new 2D photoactive materials. This paper unveils new strategies for designing 2D supramolecular polymers using calamitic residues, but also undercovers relevant aspects of pathway complexity and polymorph transitions that might be crucial for developing novel photonic systems

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Fluorescence Polyelectrolyte Nanoassemblies: Manipulate and Boost Singlet Oxygen in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

This work focuses on how to conquer the two major problems in clinical PDT: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Here we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling strategy that bestows a unique &#8220;confining isolated&#8221; inner microenvironment, which has for the first time allowed to synergistically manipulate and boost 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic modality that has shown great potential for cancer treatment. However, there exist two major problems hindering PDT applications: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Herein, we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling (photo&#8208;triggered PPN) strategy, in which porphyrin photosensitizer and photoswitchable energy accepter are assembled into polyelectrolyte micelles by a combined force of charge interaction and metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The polyelectrolyte&#8208;based PPN exhibits good biocompatibility, and bestows a unique &#8220;confining isolated&#8221; inner microenvironment for fully overcoming the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrins with significant photodynamic efficiency (123&#8208;fold enhancement). Due to the high F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (91.5&#8201;%) between porphyrin and photoswitch in closed&#8208;form, we could use light as a specific trigger to modulate photoswitch between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;form, and manipulate the 1O2 generation in three stages: pre&#8208;PDT (quenching 1O2 generation), during PDT (activating 1O2 generation), and post&#8208;PDT (silencing 1O2 generation). This de novo strategy has for the first time realized remotely manipulating and boosting 1O2 generation in PDT, well resolving the critical and general challenges of limited photodynamic efficiency and side effects from nonspecific phototoxicity.

         <title>Redox Self&#8208;Equilibration in Molecular Vanadium Oxide Mixtures Enables Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare co&#8208;crystals of two mixed&#8208;valent polyoxovanadate clusters are formed by a redox&#8208;equilibration self&#8208;assembly synthesis. The two&#8208;cluster system shows remarkable redox&#8208;activity with up to 16 redox&#8208;transitions in a potential range of ~3.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are ideal components for reversible multi&#8208;electron storage in energy technologies. To&#8208;date, most redox&#8208;applications employ only single, individual POM species, which limits the number of electrons that can be stored within a given potential window. Here, we report that spontaneous redox self&#8208;equilibration during cluster synthesis leads to the formation of two structurally related polyoxovanadates which subsequently aggregate into co&#8208;crystals. This results in systems with significantly increased redox reactivity. The mixed POM system was formed by non&#8208;aqueous self&#8208;assembly of a vanadate precursor in the presence of Mg2+, resulting in two mixed&#8208;valent (VIV/V) species, [(MgOH)V13O33Cl]4&#8722; (={MgV13}) and the di&#8208;vanadium&#8208;functionalized species [V14O34Cl]4&#8722; (={V14}), which co&#8208;crystallize in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar stoichiometry. Experimental data indicate that in the native state, {MgV13} is reduced by three electrons, and {V14} is reduced by five electrons. Electrochemical studies in solution show, that the system can reversibly undergo up to fourteen redox transitions (tentatively assigned to twelve 1&#8208;electron processes and two 2&#8208;electron processes) in the potential range between &#8722;2.15&#8197;V to +1.35&#8197;V (vs Fc+/Fc). The study demonstrates how highly redox&#8208;active, well&#8208;defined molecular mixtures of mixed&#8208;valent molecular metal oxides can be accessed by redox&#8208;equilibration during synthesis, opening new avenues for molecular energy storage.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>

All&#8208;climate batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C: A wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability is proposed. The proposed electrolyte significantly alleviates the Li plating and interfacial degradation of LiFePO4 (LFP)/graphite cells at ultralow temperatures. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit an ultra&#8208;wide operating&#8208;temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability.







Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three&#8208;electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 1200&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;C) and 10&#8208;min charge to 89&#8201;% (5&#8197;C) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and provide reliable power even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>C1&#8208;4 Alkylation of Aryl Bromides with Light Alkanes enabled by Metallaphotocatalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a protocol for the introduction of short alkyl fragments on aryl bromides using gaseous alkanes. The major advancement in this study is the possibility to bypass the use of prefunctionalized coupling partners, often synthesized in the bulk chemical industry from the parent alkane through non&#8208;selective and energy&#8208;intensive processes. Additionally, DFT calculations and mechanistic studies unveiled the factors governing the selectivity of the transformation, offering a blueprint for future reaction development in the field of metallaphotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
The homologous series of gaseous C1&#8208;4 alkanes represents one of the most abundant sources of short alkyl fragments. However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is exceedingly rare due to the challenging C&#8722;H bond cleavage, which typically demands high temperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic molecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.

In particular, the formation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel-catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate-determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of a Multi&#8208;Modular DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging and Evaluation of NK Cell&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

We developed a multi&#8208;modular, structurally&#8208;ordered DNA nanodevice for evaluating NK cell&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy (MODERN) that enabled the spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through an innovative path of GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation. The MODERN demonstrated excellent selectivity, sensitivity, and long&#8208;term integrity in cancer cells, providing a reliable tool for evaluating NK&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Granzyme&#8197;A (GzmA) secreted by natural killer (NK) cells has garnered considerable interest as a biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. However, current methodologies to selectively monitor the spatial distribution of GzmA in cancer cells during NK cell&#8208;targeted therapy are extremely challenging, primarily due to the existence of diverse cell populations, the low levels of GzmA expression, and the limited availability of GzmA probes. Herein we develop a multi&#8208;modular, structurally&#8208;ordered DNA nanodevice for evaluating NK cell&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy (MODERN), that permits spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through GzmA&#8208;induced apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) inactivation. The MODERN incorporates multiple functional modules, including an APE1&#8208;gated recognition module, a photo&#8208;activated amplification module, an aptamer&#8208;mediated tumor&#8208;target module, and a polycatenane DNA module, enabling improved sensitivity and specificity towards intracellular GzmA. The MODERN was activated (on) in cancer cells due to the overexpression of APE1, whereas it remained silent (off) in the NK&#8208;treated cancer cells owing to the GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation blocks the cellular repair of target cells, resulting in efficient cell death. This MODERN that relies on the specific inactivation of APE1 by GzmA should be beneficial for evaluating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Beyond Single&#8208;Cycle Autonomous Molecular Machines: Light&#8208;Powered Shuttling in a Multi&#8208;Cycle Reaction Network</title>

A rotaxane&#8208;based shuttle is operated autonomously by utilizing optical energy. The presence of two azobenzene moieties in the ring component of the rotaxane introduces additional complexity, which is leveraged to extend artificial non&#8208;equilibrium systems beyond single&#8208;cycle chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Biomolecular machines autonomously convert energy into functions, driving systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium. This energy conversion is achieved by leveraging complex, kinetically asymmetric chemical reaction networks that are challenging to characterize precisely. In contrast, all known synthetic molecular systems in which kinetic asymmetry has been quantified are well described by simple single&#8208;cycle networks. Here, we report on a unique light&#8208;driven [2]rotaxane that enables the autonomous operation of a synthetic molecular machine with a multi&#8208;cycle chemical reaction network. Unlike all prior systems, the present one exploits a photoactive macrocycle, which features a different photoreactivity depending on the binding sites at which it resides. Furthermore, E to Z isomerization reverses the relative affinity of the macrocycle for two binding sites on the axle, resulting in a multi&#8208;cycle network. Building on the most recent theoretical advancements, this work quantifies kinetic asymmetry in a multi&#8208;cycle network for the first time. Our findings represent the simplest rotaxane capable of autonomous shuttling developed so far and offer a general strategy to generate and quantify kinetic asymmetry beyond single&#8208;cycle systems.

         <title>Divergent Tandem Acyl Carrier Proteins Necessitate In&#8208;Series Polyketide Processing in the Leinamycin Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final module of leinamycin&#8208;type polyketide synthases (PKSs) elegantly combines &#946;&#8208;branching and sulfur incorporation to create diverse scaffolds with promising anticancer potential. We reconstitute the final stages of weishanmycin and leinamycin PKS assembly in vitro to show that an acyl carrier protein didomain in this final module is functionally inequivalent.







Abstract
The leinamycin family of polyketides are promising antitumor antibiotics, yet several aspects of their biosynthesis remain elusive. All leinamycin family members bear a sulfur&#8208;containing moiety which is essential for the anticancer activity exhibited by leinamycin. The key building blocks required for the incorporation of these functionalities are introduced in the final module of the polyketide synthase (PKS), which elegantly combines &#946;&#8208;branching and thiocysteine incorporation to generate a diverse library of sulfur&#8208;based molecular scaffolds. Two acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) form a key didomain component of this module, but their amino acid sequence divergence has brought into question the common notion of functional equivalence. Here, we provide unprecedented functional evidence that these tandem ACPs play distinct roles in the final module of polyketide assembly. Using the weishanmycin biosynthetic pathway as a template, the in vitro reconstitution of key polyketide chain extension and &#946;&#8208;branching steps in this module has revealed strict functional selectivity for a single ACP. Furthermore, we propose a cryptic transacylation step must occur prior to polyketide off&#8208;loading and cyclization. Altogether, these mechanistic investigations suggest that an atypical in&#8208;series mechanism underpins sulfur incorporation in the leinamycin family, and provides significant progress towards delineating their late&#8208;stage assembly.

         <title>Pyrrolic&#8208;Nitrogen Chemistry in 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole Electrolyte Additives toward a 50,000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, pyrrolic&#8208;N functional groups within the HEI electrolyte additives are shown to effectively control reversible Zn deposition and prevent the polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, attributed to ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The pyrrolic&#8208;N sites exhibit a greater adsorption capacity for polyiodides compared to graphitic&#8208;N and O sites, thereby imparting an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 50,000 cycles to the aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries offer benefits such as low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, their commercial application is hindered by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, which result in a short lifespan. In this study, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI) organic molecules featuring pyrrole&#8208;N groups are introduced as dually&#8208;functional electrolyte additives to simultaneously stabilize Zn anode and confine polyiodide through ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The pyrrole&#8208;N groups in HEI can preserve the interfacial pH equilibrium at Zn anode by reversibly capturing H+ ions and dynamically neutralizing OH&#8722; ions, thereby suppressing the HER. Notably, the H2 evolution rate at the Zn anode is reduced to a mere 2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;h&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the pyrrole&#8208;N moieties in HEI effectively curtail the polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode, which show adsorption energies of &#8722;0.174&#8197;eV for I2, &#8722;0.521&#8197;eV for I3&#8722;, and &#8722;0.768&#8197;eV for I&#8722;, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical testing demonstrates that the Zn//Zn symmetric cell maintains stable cycling for up to 4,200&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Most strikingly, at a high I2 mass loading of 9.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery achieves an extraordinary cycle life of 50,000 cycles.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and &#8722;0.768&#8197;eV for I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical testing demonstrates that the Zn//Zn symmetric cell maintains stable cycling for up to 4,200&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Most strikingly, at a high I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass loading of 9.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery achieves an extraordinary cycle life of 50,000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Element Sulfur to High Performance Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Polymer via Proton Transfer Enabled Anionic Hybrid Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton transfer enabled anionic hybrid copolymerization of S8 with acrylate and epoxide is achieved for the first time. The resulting copolymer demonstrates high mechanical performance, good transparency, excellent UV resistance and UV&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, good reprocessability, as well as full closed&#8208;loop recyclability.







Abstract
The utilization of sulfur has been a global issue. Copolymerization of element sulfur (S8) with other monomers is a promising route to convert it to useful materials but is limited by the comonomers. Here, we report anionic hybrid copolymerization of S8 with acrylate and epoxide at room temperature, where S8 does not copolymerize with epoxide in the absence of acrylate. Yet, the proton transfer from the methyne in acrylate to the oxygen anion enables the ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic comonomer and hence the copolymerization. The cyclic comonomers can be expanded to lactone and cyclic carbonate. Specifically, the copolymer of S8 with bisphenl A diglycidyl ether and diacrylate displays mechanical properties comparable to those of most common plastics, namely, it has ultimate tensile strength as high as 60.8&#8197;MPa and Young's modulus up to 680&#8197;MPa. It also exhibits high UV resistance and good transparency. Particularly, it has excellent UV&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, reprocessability and closed&#8208;loop recyclability due to the abundant dynamic S&#8722;S bonds and ester groups. This study provides an efficient strategy to turn element sulfur into closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymer with high mechanical and optical performances.

         <title>Direction Modulation of Intramolecular Electric Field Boosts Hole Transport in Phthalocyanines for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direction modulation of intramolecular electric field (IEF) strategy is demonstrated to be a crucial factor to improve the charge transport capabilities of conjugated molecules. Furthermore, we obtain a set of empirical formulas to provide a potential approach to rapidly assess the hole transport properties based on molecular structure. Such a modulation results in a record performance of 23.41&#8201;% for perovskite solar cells based on phthalocyanine as dopant&#8208;free hole transport material. The greatly improved device stability is also obtained.







Abstract
Tuning the strength of intramolecular electric field (IEF) in conjugated molecules has emerged as an effective approach to boost charge transfer. While direction manipulation of IEF would be a potential way that is still unclear. Here, we leverage the control of peripheral substituents of conjugated phthalocyanines to chemically tune the spatial orientation of IEF. By analyzing the spatial swing of side chains using the Kolmogorov&#8208;Arnold representation and least squares algorithm, a comprehensive mathematical&#8208;physical model has been established. This model enables rapid evaluation of the IEF and maximum hole transport performance induced by spatial swings. The champion phthalocyanine as dopant&#8208;free hole transport material in perovskite solar cell realizes a record performance of 23.41&#8201;%. Greatly device stability is also exhibited. This work affords a new way to enhance hole transport capabilities of conjugated molecules by optimizing their IEF vector for photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Dual Metallosalen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we constructed a series of dual metal sites dispersed Salen&#8208;based COFs (MM&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs, M: Zn, Ni, Cu) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction. The ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF displays a remarkable CO2 conversion activity of 102.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under a diluted CO2 atmosphere from simulated flue gas (15&#8201;% CO2), which is a record high activity among COF&#8208; and MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts under the same condition.







Abstract
Directly converting CO2 in flue gas using artificial photosynthetic technology represents a promising green approach for CO2 resource utilization. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve efficient reduction of CO2 from flue gas due to the decreased activity of photocatalysts in diluted CO2 atmosphere. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of dual metallosalen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MM&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs, M: Zn, Ni, Cu) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction and confirmed their advantage in comparison to that of single metal M&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs. As a results, the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF with dual Zn sites exhibits a prominent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 150.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under pure CO2 atmosphere, which is ~6&#8197;times higher than that of single metal Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF. Notably, the dual metal ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF still displays efficient CO2 conversion activity of 102.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 atmosphere from simulated flue gas conditions (15&#8201;% CO2), which is a record high activity among COFs&#8208; and MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts under the same reaction conditions. Further investigations and theoretical calculations suggest that the synergistic effect between the neighboring dual metal sites in the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF facilitates low concentration CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Cyctetryptomycin A and B Enabled by Zr&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthesis of cyctetryptomycin A and B employing a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed dimerization and CttpC&#8208;catalyzed oxidative macrocyclization is presented, including in&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis of the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation and its various applications. Additionally, the previously unknown detailed reaction mechanism of the CttpC&#8208;catalyzed oxidative macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A has been elucidated.







Abstract
A concise synthetic strategy utilizing a Zr catalyst for the construction of cyctetryptomycin A and B is reported. Cyctetryptomycin A and B are recently isolated, complex tetrameric natural products for which total synthesis has not been previously reported. This study presents a practical approach for the construction of two consecutive quaternary carbon centers with a Zr catalyst. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of cyctetryptomycin A and B was achieved by this Zr&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling. The radical dimerization reaction mediated by the Zr catalyst required 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) as an indispensable additive. Through both experimental and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of this Zr&#8208;catalyzed reaction, the specific role of dppe was elucidated. In addition, the synthetic approach was extended to enable the practical synthesis of other dimeric natural products, including tetratryptomycin A, dibrevianamide F, and ditryptophenaline. Finally, the synthetic mechanism of cyctetryptomycin A and B, through the oxidative macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A by CttpC, was newly elucidated by both experimental and docking simulations.

In addition, the synthetic approach was extended to enable the practical synthesis of other dimeric natural products, including tetratryptomycin A, dibrevianamide F, and ditryptophenaline. Finally, the synthetic mechanism of cyctetryptomycin A and B, through the oxidative macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A by CttpC, was newly elucidated by both experimental and docking simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Screening of Silver&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for NO Electroreduction to NH3 by DFT Calculations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the four filter criteria in a stepwise manner, Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag were screened out as promising NORR to NH3 SAA catalysts. Utilizing the database constructed by DFT calculations, we developed a machine learning model to predict the catalytic performance of SAAs and rank the crucial features. SISSO was further employed to quantitatively verify the relationships between these important features and the &#934;max(&#951;) descriptor.







Abstract
Exploring NO reduction reaction (NORR) electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity toward NH3 is essential for both NO removal and NH3 synthesis. Due to their superior electrocatalytic activities, single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted considerable attention. However, the exploration of SAAs is hindered by a lack of fast yet reliable prediction of catalytic performance. To address this problem, we comprehensively screened a series of transition&#8208;metal atom doped Ag&#8208;based SAAs. This screening process involves regression machine learning (ML) algorithms and a compressed&#8208;sensing data&#8208;analytics approach parameterized with density&#8208;functional inputs. The results demonstrate that Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag can efficiently activate and hydrogenate NO with small &#934;max(&#951;), a grand&#8208;canonical adaptation of the Gmax(&#951;) descriptor, and exhibit higher affinity to NO over H adatoms to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The NH3 selectivity is mainly determined by the s orbitals of the doped single&#8208;atom near the Fermi level. The catalytic activity of SAAs is highly correlated with the local environment of the active site. We further quantified the relationship between the intrinsic features of these active sites and &#934;max(&#951;). Our work clarifies the mechanism of NORR to NH3 and offers a design principle to guide the screen of highly active SAA catalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Ketones by a Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Semipinacol Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cobalt&#8208;salen catalyst has been used under mild, oxidative conditions to generate a cobalt(IV)&#8208;bound intermediate that is sufficiently electrophilic to promote an enantioselective 1,2&#8208;aryl migration. The excellent levels of stereocontrol and a Hammett analysis provide key evidence for the involvement of the cobalt catalyst in this cationic hydro&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed semipinacol rearrangement of symmetric &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylallylic alcohols is disclosed. A chiral cobalt&#8208;salen catalyst generates a highly electrophilic carbocation surrogate following hydrogen atom transfer and radical&#8211;polar crossover steps. This methodology provides access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones through invertive displacement of a cobalt(IV) complex during 1,2&#8208;aryl migration. A combination of readily available reagents, silane and N&#8208;fluoropyridinium oxidant, are used to confer this type of reactivity. An exploration into the effect of aryl substitution revealed the reaction tolerates para&#8208; and meta&#8208;halogenated, mildly electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with excellent enantioselectivities and yields. The yield of the rearrangement diminished with highly electron&#8208;rich aryl rings whereas very electron&#8208;deficient and ortho&#8208;substituted arenes led to poor enantiocontrol. A Hammett analysis demonstrated the migratory preference for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings, which is consistent with the intermediacy of a phenonium cation.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Acidity Chloride Electrolyte Enables Exceptional Reversibility and Stability in Aqueous Tin Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a low&#8208;acidity tin chloride electrolyte (pH~1.09) for aqueous tin metal batteries, which leads to superior plating efficiency (99.23&#8211;99.97&#8201;%) and long cyling stability (~3000&#8197;hours) across various harsh conditions.







Abstract
Tin (Sn) metal has emerged as a promising anode for aqueous batteries, due to its high capacity, non&#8208;toxicity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, Sn metal has often been coupled with strong and corrosive sulfuric acids (2&#8211;3&#8197;M), leading to severe electrode corrosion and hydrogen evolution issues. Although high efficiency and long cycling were reported, the results were achieved using high currents to kinetically mask electrode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions. Herein, we introduce a low&#8208;acidity tin chloride electrolyte (pH=1.09) as a more viable option, which eliminates the need of strong acids and enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;free Sn plating chemistry. Remarkably, the plating efficiency approaches unity (99.97&#8201;%) under standard testing conditions (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), which maintains high at 99.23&#8211;99.93&#8201;% across various aggressive conditions, including low current (0.1&#8211;0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), high capacity (5&#8211;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and extended resting time (24&#8211;72&#8197;hours). The battery calendar life is further prolonged to 3064&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing literature reports. Additionally, we presented an effective method to mitigate the potential Sn2+ oxidization issue on the cathode, demonstrating long&#8208;cycling Sn||LiMn2O4 hybrid batteries. This work offers critical insights for developing highly reversible Sn metal batteries.

Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining a high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands play significant roles for the excellent catalytic performances.







Abstract
The preparation of polyolefins with high polar monomer contents (above 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) has long been a challenge. Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands have been designed and synthesized. The complexes (Cp*)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 (2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; 5, Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) supported by Cp* and the boryloxy ligands have been shown to efficiently catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and long chain &#945;&#8208;olefins. In particular, precatalyst 5 enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining the high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands could effectively stabilize cationic active species. The mechanical studies on the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized copolymers disclosed that they exhibited high strength and toughness because of the existence of hydrogen bonds in the polymer network.

The complexes (Cp*)[HCN(Ar)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOTiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2, Ar=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; 5, Ar=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) supported by Cp* and the boryloxy ligands have been shown to efficiently catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and long chain &#945;-olefins. In particular, precatalyst 5 enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-9-decen-1-ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining the high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron-donating boryloxy ligands could effectively stabilize cationic active species. The mechanical studies on the hydroxyl-functionalized copolymers disclosed that they exhibited high strength and toughness because of the existence of hydrogen bonds in the polymer network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Triggered by Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of molten salts as reaction media to trigger strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) at reduced temperatures for Ir nanocluster supported on TiO2. The strong ionic polarization in the molten salt breaks Ti&#8722;O bonds and lowers the kinetic energy barrier for SMSI formation. The supported Ir species undergo structural evolution with increasing temperature during SMSI establishment in molten NaNO3.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a vital role in tuning the geometric and electronic structures of metal species. Generally, a high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt;500&#8201;&#176;C) in reducing atmosphere is required for constructing SMSI, which may induce the sintering of metal species. Herein, we use molten salts as the reaction media to trigger the formation of high&#8208;intensity SMSI at reduced temperatures. The strong ionic polarization of the molten salt promotes the breakage of Ti&#8722;O bonds in the TiO2 support, and hence decreases the energy barrier for the formation of interfacial bonds. Consequently, a high&#8208;intensity SMSI state is achieved in TiO2 supported Ir nanoclusters, evidenced by a large number of Ir&#8722;Ti bonds at the interface, at a low temperature of 350&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, this method is applicable for triggering SMSI in various supported metal catalysts with different oxide supports including CeO2 and SnO2. This newly developed SMSI construction methodology opens a new avenue and holds significant potential for engineering advanced supported metal catalysts toward a broad range of applications.

A large&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline 2D COFs with enhanced structural integrity and exceptional chemical and electrochemical stability was prepared. Through a simple composite process with CNTs, the resultant COF&#8208;CNT core&#8211;shell hybrids exhibit outstanding performance as lithium&#8208;ion storage materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
A large&#8208;sized single crystalline 2D COFs with excellent crystallinity and stability was prepared through the traditional thermal solvent method. The electrochemical performance can be significantly enhanced using a straightforward hybrid approach that involves in situ growth of the 2D COFs on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Both the advantages of COFs and CNTs are mutually enhanced. The single&#8208;crystalline feature of the obtained COFs improves the structural integrity and brings excellent chemical and electrochemical stabilities for lithium&#8208;ion battery applications. The resultant COF&#8208;CNT core&#8211;shell hybrids greatly improved the conductivity and demonstrated excellent lithium&#8208;ion storage performance with a high capacity of 228&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Propane Dehydrogenation on PtxZny Active Sites in Silicalite&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the stability and activity of PtxZny (x=1&#8211;3, y=0&#8211;3) in Silicalite&#8208;1 for propane dehydrogenation. The turnover frequency vs. propylene binding strength on Pt and Pt strength on the structure obeys a volcano curve. The reaction kinetics (rate, reaction order, apparent activation energy) of the Pt1Zn2 site agrees with the experimental data, strongly suggesting it is a key active site.







Abstract
The improvement of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has progressed by recent investigations that have identified Zn as a promising promoter for Pt subnanometer catalysts. It is desirable to gain insights into the structure, stability, and activity of such active sites and the factors that influence them, such as Zn&#8201;:&#8201;Pt ratio, Pt coordination and nuclearity. Here, we employ density functional theory and microkinetic simulations to investigate the stability of PtxZny (x=1&#8211;3, y=0&#8211;3) active sites grafted on silanols of Silicalite&#8208;1 and the PDH activity of Pt. We find that the coordination of a Pt atom to a nest of grafted Zn(II) atoms increases the stability of the Pt1Zny sites, whose activity is similar for y=0&#8211;2 and drops dramatically for y&gt;2. We further demonstrate, via linear scaling relations and microkinetic simulations, that the turnover frequency obeys a volcano law as a function of propylene binding strength. The Pt2Zn1 and Pt3Zn1 sites are stable and exhibit activity similar to Pt1Zn2, but only Pt1Zn2 manifests reaction kinetics consistent with experimental data, strongly suggesting the active site composition in the synthesized catalyst samples. The methodology presented here suggests a general strategy for deducing active site information such as composition through simple kinetic experiments.

Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters 1 with terminal alkynes 2 affords polysubstituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines 3 which can be converted to 2H&#8208;pyrroles 4 under acidic conditions.

Abstract
We report in this paper a novel Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polysubstituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. The reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters 4 with terminal alkynes 5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OAc)2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinoline affords the corresponding 1,6&#8208;enynimines, which undergo a highly stereoselective Alder&#8208;ene reaction to afford 1&#8208;pyrrolines with concomitant generation of a quaternary carbon and a 2&#8208;azadiene motif. It represents an unusual [4+1] heteroannulation reaction wherein terminal alkynes act as a one carbon donor and are 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized. Mechanistic studies suggest that the allylic hydrogen trans to the oxime ester main chain is selectively transferred to the electron&#8208;rich alkyne during the pericyclic reaction. The resulting 1&#8208;pyrrolines undergo facile acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement to provide 2H&#8208;pyrroles in excellent yields. The 2H&#8208;pyrroles are also accessible from 4 and 5 in a one&#8208;pot manner without isolation of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines. Leveraging this heteroannulation reaction as a key step, the first total synthesis of borrecapine, a 2,3,3,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine, is accomplished.

         <title>D&#8208;Band&#8208;Center&#8208;Engineered Platinum&#8208;Based Nanozyme for Personalized Pharmacovigilance</title>

The correlation between d&#8208;band centers and hydrogen peroxide activation barriers was used to screen platinum&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped nanozymes, which effectively enabled sensitive analysis of trace CO&#8208;releasing molecules in the blood, suggesting that catalysts designed on the basis of d&#8208;band centers are of great significance in drug monitoring and metabolic management.







Abstract
A high&#8208;efficiency PtZnCd nanozyme was screened with density functional theory (DFT) and unique d&#8208;orbital coupling features for sensitive enrichment and real&#8208;time analysis of CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;3 (CORM&#8208;3). Multicatalytic sites in the nanozyme showed a high reactivity of up to 72.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like reaction, which was 2.2, 4.07, and 14.67 times higher than that of PtZn (32.67&#8197;min&#8722;1), PtCd (17.89&#8197;min&#8722;1), and Pt (4.97&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Normalization of the catalytic sites showed that the catalytic capacity of the active site in PtZnCd was 2.962&#8197;U &#956;mol&#8722;1, which was four times higher than that of a pure Pt site (0.733&#8197;U &#956;mol&#8722;1). DFT calculations showed that improved d&#8208;orbital coupling between different metals reduces the position of the center of the shifted whole d&#8208;band relative to the Fermi energy level, thereby increasing the contribution of the sites to the electron transfer from the active center, accompanied by enhanced substrate adsorption and intermediate conversion in the catalytic process. The potential adsorption principle and color development mechanism of CORM&#8208;3 on PtZnCd were determined, and its practical application in drug metabolism was validated in vitro and in zebrafish and mice models, demonstrating that transition&#8208;metal doping effectively engineers high&#8208;performance nanozymes and optimizes artificial enzymes.

         <title>Spiral&#8208;Concave Prussian Blue Crystals with Rich Steps: Growth Mechanism and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work meticulously examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram of the spiral concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) microcrystals. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.







Abstract
Investigating the formation and transformation mechanisms of spiral&#8208;concave crystals holds significant potential for advancing innovative material design and comprehension. We examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms of Prussian Blue crystals with spiral concave structures, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram. The spiral&#8208;concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) crystals, characterized by high&#8208;density surface steps and a low stress&#8208;strain architecture, exhibit enhanced activity due to their facile interaction with reactants. Notably, the coordination environment of SC&#8208;HCF can be precisely modulated by the introduction of diverse metals. Utilizing X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, we elucidated the formation mechanism of SC&#8208;HCF to Co&#8208;HCF facilitated by oriented adsorption&#8208;ion exchange (OA&#8208;IE) process. Both experimental data, and density functional theory confirm that Co&#8208;HCF possesses an optimized energy band structure, capable of adjusting the local electronic environment and enhancing the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.

         <title>Rational Construction of Cyanide&#8208;Functionalized D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Covalent Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis from Air and Water</title>

Rational synthesis of cyanide&#8208;functionalized D&#8722;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D COFs is shown here to solve the challenging issue of sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air, showing an excellent H2O2 production performance, including in ultrahigh production rate, ultrahigh O2 utilization and conversion rate, ultrahigh stability, and rare ORR+WOR pathway.







Abstract
Sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and air represents currently a promising route to reform the industrial anthraquinone production manner, but, still blocks by the requirement of pure O2 feedstock, due to the insufficient oxygen supply from water under air. Herein, we report a rational molecule design on COFs (covalent organic frameworks) equiped with cyanide&#8208;functionalized D&#8722;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D system for highly efficient overall H2O2 production from air and water through photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). Without using any sacrificial agent, the as&#8208;synthesized D&#8722;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D COF is found to enable a H2O2 production rate as high as 4742&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 from water and air and an O2 utilization and conversion rate up to 88&#8201;%, exceeding the other D&#8722;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A COF by respectively 1.9&#8208; and 1.3&#8208;fold. Such high performance is attributed to the tuned electronic structure and prolonged charge lifetime facilitated by the unique D&#8722;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D structure and cyanide groups. This work highlights a fundamental molecule design on advanced photocatalytic COFs with complicated D&#8211;A system for low&#8208;cost and massive H2O2 production.

         <title>Dipole Moment Dictates the Preferential Immobilization in Gel Electrolytes for Ah&#8208;level Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is reported that anions and H2O, not anions and cations, are preferentially immobilized at different sites of zwitterionic polymers, which benefits the free migration of Zn2+ and reduces the side reactions. This result is correlated with molecular dipole moment, enabling us to prioritize the potential zwitterionic polymers as the hydrogel electrolyte and improving the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries are of great interest due to their high material abundance, low production cost, and excellent safety. However, they suffer from severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth closely related to electrolytes. Here, in situ generated zwitterionic polymers are used as gel electrolytes to overcome these problems. It is shown that anions and H2O, but not anions and cations, are preferentially immobilized at different sites of zwitterionic polymers, facilitating the free migration of Zn2+ and reducing the side reactions. This immobilization can be associated with the dipole moment of zwitterionic polymers. As a result, poly[3&#8208;dimethyl(methacryloyloxy ethyl) ammonium propane sulfonate] (PDMAPS) stands out from a series of zwitterionic polymers and outperforms the other candidates in electrochemical performance. The symmetric cells using PDMAPS smoothly operate ~9000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much better than the controls. Moreover, PDMAPS enables an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell for continuous cycling. These results not only benefit the rational molecular design of advanced electrolytes, but also demonstrate the promising potential of zwitterionic polymers in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Chemoselective Construction of Polycyclic Heterocycles Containing a [6&#8208;6&#8208;5] or [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] Tricyclic Core Skeleton from a 2&#8208;Isocyanophenyl Propargylic Ester</title>

         <dc:description>
New functionalized isocyanides featuring both isocyano and propargylic ester moieties were readily synthesized. The cascade reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic esters and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimines enabled the construction of pentacyclic skeletons. Another structurally unique chromeno [3,2&#8208;f] azepine with a quarternary carbon center and [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core structure was also observed when a 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine was utilized.







Abstract
Functionalized isocyanide chemistry represents an important research area in organic synthesis. A structurally unique 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester has been designed to incorporate the reactivity of isocyanide and propargylic ester functionalities. Thus, the reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimine facilitates the synthesis of a wide range of polycyclic benzo[b] indolo [3,2&#8208;h][1,6] naphthyridine derivatives. Furthermore, reaction with 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine enables the divergent synthesis of both the aforementioned scaffolds and structurally distinct diazabenzo [f] naphtho[2,3,4&#8208;ij] azulenes featuring a [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core skeleton. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that these transformations likely proceed by the in situ generation of a strained cyclopropenimine species followed by [3+2] cycloaddition. Next, switchable nucleophilic attack/ring expansion/aromatization and nucleophilic addition/ring expansion/elimination account for the observed selectivity.

         <title>Towards Stable Helical Structures with Enhanced Molecular Conductance by Strengthening Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method to stabilize the folded helical conformations of ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene is proposed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine rings into molecular backbone to strengthen intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. In consequence, the through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transport pathway becomes dominant in folded helical molecules and contributes significantly to molecular conductance, with a 70&#8201;% enhancement.







Abstract
Developing long&#8208;chain molecules with stable helical structures is of significant importance for understanding and modulating the properties and functions of helical biological macromolecules, but challenging. In this work, an effective and facile approach to stabilize folded helical structures by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation is proposed, using new ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene (o&#8208;HP) derivatives as models. The structure&#8211;activity relationship between the through&#8208;space conjugation and charge&#8208;transport behavior of the prepared folded helical o&#8208;HP derivatives is experimentally and theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that the through&#8208;space conjugation within o&#8208;HP derivatives can be strengthened by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine rings, which can effectively stabilize the helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives. Moreover, scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;break junction measurements reveal that the stable regular helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives open&#8208;up dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transport pathways, and the single&#8208;molecule conductance is enhanced by more than 70&#8201;% by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation with pyridine and pyrazine. However, the through&#8208;bond charge transport pathways contribute much less to the conductance of o&#8208;HP derivatives. These results not only provide a new method for exploring stable helical molecules, but also provide a stepping stone for deciphering and modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of helical systems at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Anomalous Pressure&#8208;Induced Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission of Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Clusters: The Competitive Effect between Cuprophilic Interactions and Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The competitive effect between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions achieved the anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence of ionic copper&#8208;iodide clusters, which corresponds to the triplet excitons exhibiting a luminescence dominated by 3TSCT and supplemented by 3CC.







Abstract
Developing ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with multiple emitting is crucial for enriching lighting and display materials with various colors. However, the luminescent properties of traditional ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters are often closely associated with low&#8208;energy cluster&#8208;centered triplet emission, which will redshift further as the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu bond length decreases. This article utilizes a pressure&#8208;treated strategy to achieve an anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence phenomenon in ionic Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 crystals for the first time, which is based on dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT). Herein, we reveal that the more advantageous through&#8208;space interactions in the competition between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions can lead to a blue&#8208;shifted luminescence. High&#8208;pressure angle&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;pressure infrared experiments show that the enhanced through&#8208;space interactions mainly originate from forming new intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonds and the enhancement of van der Waals interactions between organic cations and anionic clusters. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies of excited&#8208;state dynamics confirm that the blue&#8208;shifted emission is due to the increased energy gap between the excited triplet and ground states caused by the electron delocalization under stronger through&#8208;space interactions. This work deepens previous understanding and provides a new avenue to design and synthetic ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with high&#8208;energy TSCT emission.

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;Lactams: Reaction Development, Mechanistic Study, and Application to the Total Syntheses of Tricyclic Marine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed, which provides an enabling tool for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactams. The reactions display several appealing features including excellent efficiency, high stereospecificity, and predictable chemoselectivity. Leveraging the newly developed methods, three tricyclic marine alkaloids have been synthesized in a concise and efficient manner.







Abstract
An unprecedented dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed, which provides an enabling tool for the synthesis of structurally diverse &#947;&#8208;butyrolactams. Unlike the well&#8208;established dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones, the present reaction probably proceeds through a dual&#8208;activation mode, and thus displays unusual reactivity and chemoselectivity. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that the dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams may proceed through different mechanisms depending on the nature of migrating groups (H, alkyl, or aryl). Hinging on a chemoselective H&#8208;migration dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams, we have completed the divergent synthesis of tricyclic marine alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;lepadiformine A, (+)&#8208;cylindricine C, and (&#8722;)&#8208;fasicularin within 11&#8211;12 longest linear steps.

         <title>Accelerated Reversible Conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S by Spidroin Regulated Li+ Flux for High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

We introduced Spidroin as a dual functional separator coating to adsorb polysulfides via the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure and regulate Li+ flux through the &#946;&#8208;sheet of its secondary structure, thus accelerating the reversible conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Regulating the transformation of sulfur species is the key to improving the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, in particular, to accelerate the reversible conversion between solid phase Li2S2 and Li2S. Herein, we introduced Spidroin, which is a main protein in spider silk, as a dual functional separator coating in Li&#8722;S batteries to effectively adsorb polysulfides via the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure and regulate Li+ flux through the &#946;&#8208;sheet of its secondary structure, thus accelerating the reversible transformation between Li2S2 and Li2S. Spidroin&#8208;based Li&#8722;S cells exhibited an exceptional electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 744.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and a high areal capacity of 7.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1 and a sulfur loading of 8.6 mgs cm&#8722;2.

A synthetic strategy to access highly redox&#8208;active polyoxovanadate (POV) co&#8208;crystals is reported by Carsten Streb et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202418864). Two structurally related POV species (red and teal) form spontaneously by non&#8208;aqueous self&#8208;assembly and redox&#8208;self&#8208;equilibration. The species show high redox&#8208;reactivity and can reversibly store up to 16 electrons, illustrated by the 3&#8208;dimensional square wave voltammogram (blue) linking the clusters. This makes the species ideal candidates for electrical energy storage.

2D supramolecular polymorphism emerges in a cyanine system from a complex self&#8208;assembly landscape. Designed by Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. (e202415774), the cyanine dye with two rod&#8208;like side groups initially forms nanoparticle&#8208;like aggregates, that transform into 2D H&#8208;type and J&#8208;type aggregates through thermal transitions. This study highlights the importance of understanding pathway complexity in supramolecular polymers to design photonic materials with customized morphology and optical properties.

         <dc:description>
Flat protein surfaces involved in protein&#8211;protein interactions are notoriously difficult targets. In their Research Article (e202410435), Tam&#225;s A. Martinek, Gy&#246;rgy M. Keser&#369; et&#8197;al. addressed this challenge by creating a protein surface&#8208;compatible library of short helical foldamers that can be used as fragments. The light&#8208;induced photoscreening enabled the capture and localization of the weak binding of the helices to the target. Protein&#8208;templated linking of the initial hits to dimeric compounds increased their affinity and resulted in functional proteomimetics.

In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202410435"&gt;e202410435&lt;/a&gt;), Tam&#225;s A. Martinek, Gy&#246;rgy M. Keser&#369; et&#8197;al. addressed this challenge by creating a protein surface-compatible library of short helical foldamers that can be used as fragments. The light-induced photoscreening enabled the capture and localization of the weak binding of the helices to the target. Protein-templated linking of the initial hits to dimeric compounds increased their affinity and resulted in functional proteomimetics.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanographenes including 3D graphene, graphene quantum dots and graphene nanoribbons are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes are original from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect, which can efficiently modify the charge distribution, optimize intermediate adsorption and accelerate electron transfer steps.







Abstract
Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.

         <title>Better Together: Photoredox/Copper Dual Catalysis in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of Cu&#8208;ATRP catalysis with photocatalysts (PCs) that absorb visible and/or NIR light exhibits synergistic action at the ppm/ppb concentration level. It leads to very well&#8208;defined polymers with rates depending on the amount and quantum efficiency of PC but controlled polymer architecture defined by the Cu&#8208;catalysts. Thus, they can act much better together, providing robustness, oxygen tolerance, and access to new materials.







Abstract
Photomediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (photoATRP) is an activator regeneration method, which allows for the controlled synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers via light irradiation. Traditional photoATRP is often limited by the need for high&#8208;energy ultraviolet or violet light. These could negatively affect the control and selectivity of the polymerization, promote side reactions, and may not be applicable to biologically relevant systems. This drawback can be circumvented by an introduction of the catalytic amount of photocatalysts, which absorb visible and/or NIR light and, therefore, controlled, regenerative ATRP can be performed with the dual&#8208;catalytic cycle. Herein, a critical summary of recent developments in the field of dual&#8208;catalysis concerning Cu&#8208;catalyzed ATRP is provided. Contributions of involved species are examined mechanistically, followed by challenges and future directions towards the next generation of advanced functional macromolecular materials.

         <title>Emission Library and Applications of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazole and Its Derivative&#8208;Based Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the progress in 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), focusing on the design principle of emissive linkers, and the relationship between linker structure and emission behaviors of MOFs. The applications of the constructed MOFs are highlighted, including chemical sensing, energy transfer and catalysis.







Abstract
Organic linker&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive attention due to their promising applications in chemical sensing, energy transfer, solid&#8208;state&#8208;lighting and heterogeneous catalysis. Benefiting from the virtually unlimited emissive organic linkers and the intrinsic advantages of MOFs, significant progress has been made in constructing LMOFs with specific emission behaviors and outstanding performances. Among these reported organic linkers, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivatives, as unique building units with tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities, can be used to synthesize numerous emissive linkers with a donor&#8208;bridge&#8208;acceptor&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor type structure. These linkers were utilized to coordinate with different metal nodes, forming LMOFs with diverse underlying nets and optical properties. In this Minireview, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based organic linkers and their corresponding LMOFs are summarized with which an emission library is built between the linker structures and the emission behaviors of constructed LMOFs. In particular, the preparation of LMOFs with customized emission properties ranging from deep&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared and sizes from dozens to hundreds of nanometers is discussed in detail. The applications of these LMOFs, including chemical sensing, energy harvesting and transfer, and catalysis, are then highlighted. Key perspectives and challenges for the future development of LMOFs are also addressed.

         <title>Ligand Assisted Hydrogen Bonding: A Game&#8208;Changer in Lead Passivation and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review discusses the challenges of lead halide perovskite solar cells under environmental stressors, which led to uncoordinated lead ions escaping from the lattice. The review article highlights the role of ligands in mitigating lead ions through hydrogen bond formation, enhancing structural integrity, and defect passivation.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies comparable to silicon&#8208;based solar cells, yet their instability under environmental stressors, such as humidity, heat, and light, remains a significant barrier to commercialization. A primary cause of this instability is the uncoordinated lead ions (Pb2+), which accelerates the degradation of PSCs and pose environmental concerns due to potential lead leakage. Recently, the introduction of ligands into PSCs has shown promise in mitigating lead toxicity through effective passivation, primarily by forming hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) between functional groups of the ligands and the perovskite structure. In this minireview, we explore the critical role of H&#8208;bonds in stabilizing PSCs by enhancing the structural integrity of the perovskite layer and reducing lead leakage. Furthermore, we discuss the contribution of these ligands in defect passivation, hydrophobicity, self&#8208;encapsulation, cross&#8208;linking, and self&#8208;healing mechanisms. These insights will highlight the multi&#8208;functional capabilities of ligands in improving the long&#8208;term stability and durability of PSCs, offering pathways to address current challenges in their commercialization.

         <title>Structure Prediction and Computational Protein Design for Efficient Biocatalysts and Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry 2024 was jointly awarded to David Baker for computational protein design and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for protein structure prediction. This highlight showcases the impact of the Nobel prize laureates&#8217; contributions and summarizes the history, state of the art, applications and future directions of these methods.







Abstract
The ability to predict and design protein structures has led to numerous applications in medicine, diagnostics and sustainable chemical manufacture. In addition, the wealth of predicted protein structures has advanced our understanding of how life's molecules function and interact. Honouring the work that has fundamentally changed the way scientists research and engineer proteins, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 was awarded to David Baker for computational protein design and jointly to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who developed AlphaFold for machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based protein structure prediction. Here, we highlight notable contributions to the development of these computational tools and their importance for the design of functional proteins that are applied in organic synthesis. Notably, both technologies have the potential to impact drug discovery as any therapeutic protein target can now be modelled, allowing the de novo design of peptide binders and the identification of small molecule ligands through in silico docking of large compound libraries. Looking ahead, we highlight future research directions in protein engineering, medicinal chemistry and material design that are enabled by this transformative shift in protein science.

         <title>Iodide Anion Enables a Reductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling for Preparing Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of iminium ions with a range of electrophilic substrates to prepare tertiary amines. This reaction is mediated by the underexplored single&#8208;electron reducing power of the iodide counter anion, which is investigated both experimentally and through quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The reducing power of iodide anion is an underexplored property that can be used for the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of organic molecules. Herein we harness this trait for the preparation of tertiary amines through the combination of two simple reagents: an electrophilic&#8208;carbon precursor and an iminium iodide in a dual role &#8211; both as nitrogen&#8208;containing building block and as reducing agent. The underlying mechanism of this new C&#8722;C bond&#8208;formation paradigm is explored through a combination of experiment and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Engineering Stable Decomposition Products on Cathode Surfaces to Enable High Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of a cost&#8208;effective coating on high&#8208;voltage NCM85 cathode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries&#8212;utilizing the stable decomposition products of LiPO2F2&#8212;successfully suppresses the electrochemical decomposition of the argyrodite Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte. Cells using the LiPOF&#8208;coated NCM85 demonstrated significantly improved capacity retention over 200 cycles, outperforming cells using uncoated NCM85.







Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5&#8197;V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Using guidance from density functional theory, we devise an effective, conformal, and thin coating on the cathode active material, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82&#8201;% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.3&#8197;V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56&#8201;% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

The coating fabricated in this cost-effective process showed superior performance to state-of-the-art coatings such as LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low-cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte-based all-solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB, which represents the shortest fragment of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes, has been synthesized. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotube structure.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105&#8197;L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8&#8197;&#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate hydroarsination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds is uncovered, which affords a series of chiral tertiary arsanes in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is achieved in moderate to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity, based on the proposed nucleophilic [Cu]&#8722;AsPh2 species. As for &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, a 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination/enantioselective protonation event occurs smoothly in satisfying results. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amide, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfide are well applied in the present catalytic system. Finally, some control experiments show that HAsPh2 is activated through coordination with the copper(I) catalyst and HAsPh2 exhibits inferior soft Lewis basicity to HPPh2 in the presence of a copper(I)&#8208;bisphosphine complex.

         <dc:description>
A series of bis(semiquinone) linearly &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds with dithiophene bridges of different lengths were prepared that ranged from closed&#8208;shell (the smallest) to full diradical (the longest) accompanied with narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (magnetic response). The medium&#8208;sized compound had absorptions and emission in the near&#8208;infrared region mediated by a unique case of anti&#8208;Kasha emission.







Abstract
We have prepared a series of bis(semiquinone) compounds with dithiophene bridges of different length that evolve from closed&#8208;shell (smaller compound) to full diradical (longer compound) for which the narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap allows the triplet population at 298&#8197;K. The medium size system has a variety of photonic properties with absorptions and emission in the optical near&#8208;infrared region mediated by a unique case of anti&#8208;Kasha emission. A whole set of optical absorption/emission and vibrational steady state spectroscopies as well as picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, all complemented with spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations, is presented.

         <title>Bidirectional Molecular Motors by Controlling Threading and Dethreading Pathways of a Linked Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM)&#8208;type molecular motors with a rotaxane&#8208;type topology has been developed. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting with the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction were also achieved.







Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have been presented as models for biological molecular motors. In contrast to the conventional artificial molecular motors that rely on covalent bond rotation, molecular motors with mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their ability to generate significant rotational motion by dynamically shuttling macrocyclic components. The topology of MIM&#8208;type rotational molecular motors is currently limited to catenane structures, which require intricate synthetic procedures that typically produce a low synthetic yield. In this study, we develop a novel class of MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with a rotaxane&#8208;type topology. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation of the molecular motor. The threading/dethreading reaction rates were quantitatively evaluated through detailed spectroscopic investigations. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction of rotation were also achieved. Our findings demonstrate that linked rotaxanes can serve as MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with reversible rotational direction controlled by threading/dethreading reactions. These motors hold potential as components of molecular machinery.

         <title>Catalyzing PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerizations Using Inherently Photoactive Zinc Myoglobin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalyzed reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations are achieved using photoactive zinc myoglobin without the need for any additional reducing agents or co&#8208;catalysts. Zinc myoglobin shows improved catalytic activity over the free zinc porphyrin cofactor (zinc mesoporphyrin IX) and leads to controlled polymerizations with predictable molecular weights, low dispersities, and retention of chain&#8208;end functional groups.







Abstract
Protein photocatalysts provide a modular platform to access new reaction pathways and affect product outcomes, but their use in polymer synthesis is limited because co&#8208;catalysts and/or co&#8208;reductants are required to complete catalytic cycles. Herein, we report using zinc myoglobin (ZnMb), an inherently photoactive protein, to mediate photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations. Using ZnMb as the sole reagent for catalysis, photomediated polymerizations of N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide in PBS were achieved with predictable molecular weights, dispersity values approaching 1.1, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. We found that initial apparent rate constants of polymerization increased from 4.6&#215;10&#8211;5&#8197;s&#8722;1 for zinc mesoporpyhrin IX (ZnMIX) to 6.5&#215;10&#8211;5&#8197;s&#8722;1 when ZnMIX was incorporated into myoglobin to yield ZnMb, indicating that the protein binding site enhanced catalytic activity. Chain extension reactions comparing ZnMb&#8208;mediated RAFT polymerizations to thermally&#8208;initiated RAFT polymerizations showed minimal differences in block copolymer molecular weights and dispersities. This work enables studies to elucidate how protein modifications (e.g., secondary structure folding, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, directed evolution) can be used to modulate polymerization outcomes (e.g., selective monomer additions towards sequence control, tacticity control, molar mass distributions).

&lt;p&gt;Photocatalyzed reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations are achieved using photoactive zinc myoglobin without the need for any additional reducing agents or co-catalysts. Zinc myoglobin shows improved catalytic activity over the free zinc porphyrin cofactor (zinc mesoporphyrin IX) and leads to controlled polymerizations with predictable molecular weights, low dispersities, and retention of chain-end functional groups.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transient transition from Stable to Dissipative Assemblies in Response to the Spatiotemporal Availability of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of a chemical fuel at a precise location causes a transition from thermodynamically stable to dissipative assemblies. After local depletion of fuel the system returns to the resting state. The study illustrates how a self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.







Abstract
The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy&#8208;dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self&#8208;assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy&#8208;dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant&#8208;based structures templated by ATP. Injection of substrate leads to the inclusion of additional surfactant molecules in the assemblies leading to the formation of catalytic hotspots for substrate conversion. After the local disappearance of the substrate as a result of chemical conversion and diffusion the assemblies spontaneously return to the stable state, which can be reactivated upon the injection of a new batch of fuel. The study illustrates how a dissipating self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.

         <title>Coronene&#8208;Based 2D Networks by On&#8208;Surface Skeletal Rearrangement of Sumanene Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D coronene&#8208;based networks have been synthesized by intramolecular rearrangements and subsequent coupling of sumanene precursors deposited on a hot Au(111) substrate. This approach paves the way for synthesizing organometallic and covalent low&#8208;dimensional nanoarchitectures by exploiting the intramolecular transformation of molecular precursors and their subsequent intermolecular reactivity.







Abstract
The design of novel low&#8208;dimensional carbon materials is at the forefront of modern chemistry. Recently, on&#8208;surface covalent synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy to synthesize previously precluded compounds and polymers. Here, we report a scanning probe microscopy study, complemented by theoretical calculations, on the sequential skeletal rearrangement of sumanene&#8208;based precursors into a coronene&#8208;based organometallic network by stepwise intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular reactions on Au(111). Interestingly, upon higher annealing, the formed organometallic networks evolve into two&#8208;dimensional coronene&#8208;based covalently linked patches through intermolecular homocoupling reactions. A new reaction mechanism is proposed based on the role of C&#8722;Au&#8722;C motifs to promote two stepwise carbon&#8208;carbon couplings to form cyclobutadiene bridges. Our results pave avenues for the conversion of molecular precursors on surfaces, affording the design of unexplored two&#8208;dimensional organometallic and covalent materials.

Synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure in the dense &#8220;skin&#8221; and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers derived from 6FDA&#8201;:&#8201;BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors via a pre&#8208;pyrolysis sub&#8208;Tg thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables significantly increased propylene permeance while maintaining adequate propylene/propane selectivity.







Abstract
Asymmetric carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes with tunable micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structural morphologies for energy efficient propylene&#8208;propane separation are reported here. A sub&#8208;glass transition temperature (sub&#8208;Tg) thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables simultaneous optimization of the intrinsic molecular sieving properties while also reducing the thickness of the CMS &#8220;skin&#8221; derived from the 6FDA&#8201;:&#8201;BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors. Such synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers enables significantly increased propylene permeance (reaching 186.5&#8197;GPU) while maintaining an appealing propylene/propane selectivity of 13.3 for 50/50 propylene/propane mixed gas feeds. Our findings reveal a more refined and versatile tool than available with previous O2&#8208;doping pretreatments. The advanced approach here should be broadly useful to other polyimide precursors and diverse gas pairs.

The synthesis and striking reactivity of the first 1,2,3&#8208;trisilacyclopentadiene I with a hypercoordinate &#955;4Si= &#955;3Si bond is reported. The compound consumes one molar equivalent CO and xylyl isocyanide to afford the unprecedented 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadienes II and III with an endocyclic hypercoordinate &#955;4Si= &#955;3C bond attached to a conjugated Si=O group or aminosilylene pendent, respectively.







Abstract
The facile reaction of the SiPh2&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;silylene (LSi:)2SiPh2 (L=PhC(NBut)2) with diphenylacetylene affords the unprecedented 1,2,3&#8208;trisilacyclopentadiene (LSi)2(PhC)2SiPh2 1 with a hypercoordinate &#955;4Si&#8722;&#955;3Si double bond. Compound 1 is very oxophilic and consumes three molar equivalents of inert N2O to form the bicyclic oxygenation product 2 through O&#8208;atom insertion in the Si=Si and Si&#8722;Si bonds. Strikingly, 1 can completely split the C&#8801;O bonds of carbon monoxide under ambient conditions (1&#8197;atm, room temperature), yielding the 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadiene 3, representing the first hypercoordinate example of a cyclosilene with a &#955;4Si&#8208;&#955;3C double bond. Likewise, reaction of Xyl&#8208;NC (Xyl=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl), an isocyanide isoelectronic with CO, with 1 furnishes the related 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadiene 4 but with an amidinato silylene pendent attached to the Si=C carbon ring atom.

Likewise, reaction of Xyl-NC (Xyl=2,6-dimethylphenyl), an isocyanide isoelectronic with CO, with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; furnishes the related 1,3-disilacyclopentadiene &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; but with an amidinato silylene pendent attached to the Si=C carbon ring atom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bismuthenium Cations for the Transport of Chloride Anions via Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for main group derivatives that mediate chloride transport across phospholipid bilayers has led to the identification of chalcogen&#8208;supported diarylbismuthenium cations as suitable examples of such compounds. Deploying these water&#8208;stable cations in chloride&#8208;loaded vesicles shows that their transport properties can be adjusted by the strength of the chalcogen&#8594;bismuth interaction, as well as the overall lipophilicity of their structures.







Abstract
Our interest in the design of heavy pnictogen&#8208;based Lewis acids for anion trafficking across biological membrane mimics has led us to investigate trivalent bismuthenium cations as chloride anion transporters. Here, we describe two chlorodiarylbismuthines, elaborated on a peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene backbone and stabilized by an adjacent thio&#8208; or seleno&#8208;ether functionality that engages the bismuth center in a Ch&#8594;Bi interaction (Ch=chalcogen). These new derivatives are stable in aqueous environment and readiliy transport chloride anions across the membrane of phospholipid&#8208;based vesicles loaded with KCl. In addition to establishing the use of such motifs in anion transport, this investigation shows that the Lewis acidity, lipophilicity, and thus chloride transport properties depend on the nature of the chalcogen.

         <title>Calibrating the Oxidative Capacity of Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the spontaneous one electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning a range of oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1&#8197;V to +0.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile microdroplets generated by nebulization using nitrogen gas. Our key finding is that the oxidative yields do not obey the Nernst equation and that ferrocenes in a mixture show oxidative competition, implying that his oxidation is not a constant potential process.







Abstract
Recently, redox chemical transformations have been reported to occur spontaneously in microdroplets. The origins of such novel reactivity are still debated, and any systematic correlation of the oxidative/reductive yield with the reactivity of the reactant is yet to be established. Towards this end, we report the simple, outer&#8208;sphere, one&#8208;electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning a range of oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1&#8197;V to +0.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile microdroplets generated via nebulization and measured by mass spectrometry of the corresponding ferrocenium ions. The reaction environments and dynamics in the droplets are complex, and it is still unclear whether such reactivity correlates with any bulk thermodynamic values. Our key finding is that the ion yields decrease monotonically with the oxidation potential of the ferrocenes, which is a thermodynamic quantity. The ion yields emphatically do not obey the Nernstian ratio, revealing the redox processes in the droplets do not follow the assumptions of bulk steady&#8208;state electrochemistry. Furthermore, oxidative competition in the mixture of several ferrocenes suggest a finite oxidative capacity or oxidant concentration. These results demonstrate that even though ion generation could be an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium and kinetically limited process, the oxidative yield in microdroplets does correlate with thermodynamics, suggesting a possible free energy relationship between the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process.

         <title>Nucleophilic Fluoride Anion Delivery from Triazacyclononane&#8208;Supported Molecular Ca&#8211;F Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane scaffold is employed for the synthesis of dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes. A bridging Ca&#8208;F&#8722;Ca motif is confirmed crystallographically and nucleophilic fluoride delivery demonstrated in the formation of a range of E&#8722;F bonds. The less nucleophilic anionic O&#8208;donor set reduces the extent of ligand&#8208;centered side reactions compared to related amide&#8208;derived systems.







Abstract
The major source of fluoride, namely calcium difluoride (CaF2), is derived from the mineral fluorspar. Recent advances in the activation of CaF2 via mechanochemical methods have inspired investigation of the fundamental properties of Ca&#8211;F bonds in molecular complexes. However, the paucity of well&#8208;defined molecular Ca&#8211;F&#8208;containing complexes undermines systematic understanding of the factors governing nucleophilic fluoride delivery. Here we report the use of a multidentate bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) scaffold for the formation of well&#8208;defined Ca&#8211;F complexes and demonstrate their capabilities in fluoride delivery. Key to this synthesis is a desymmetrization step carried out on the TACN ligand within the Ca coordination sphere. A series of stable anionic dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes has then been accessed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (critically by 19F NMR) and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Nucleophilic fluoride delivery can be used to generate C&#8722;F, Si&#8211;F and S&#8722;F bonds, with a notable advance over amide&#8208;derived ligand scaffolds being the reduced extent of side reactions derived from competing attack on the electrophile by the less nucleophilic O&#8208;donor anionic ligand set.

         <title>The Nature of Structural Defects in ZIF&#8208;8 Revealed with 1H and 31P MAS NMR and X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of experimental techniques including 1H and 31P MAS NMR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and phosphine molecular probes was used to characterize for the first time the catalytically active defect sites in ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework. These defect sites were found to be represented by Zn&#8722;OH hydroxyl groups with the signal at 0.3 and &#8722;0.7&#8197;ppm (1H MAS NMR) and were found to be of basic nature.







Abstract
The metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) attract interest as potential catalysts whose catalytic properties are driven by defects. Several methods have been proposed for the defects&#8208;inducing synthesis of MOFs. However, the active species formed on the defective sites remain elusive and uncharacterized, as the spectroscopic fingerprints of these species are hidden by the regular structure signals. In this work, we have performed the synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 MOF with defect&#8208;inducing procedures using fully deuterated 2&#8208;methylimidazolate ligands to enhance the defective sites&#8242; visibility. By combining 1H and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we have found evidence for the presence of different structural hydroxyl Zn&#8722;OH groups in the ZIF&#8208;8 materials. It is demonstrated that the ZIF&#8208;8 defect sites are represented by Zn&#8722;OH hydroxyl groups with the signals at 0.3 and &#8722;0.7&#8197;ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum. These species are of basic nature and may be responsible for the catalytic activity of the ZIF&#8208;8 material.

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum Gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>

Plastic waste accumulation poses a severe threat to human and ecosystem health. As current recycling methods are inadequate, biocatalytic degradation offers a more sustainable platform. Using genome mining, we discovered TvgC, a new 6&#8208;aminohexanoate oligomer endohydrolase (NylC). TvgC has no affiliations to nylon facilities, is the most thermostable and promiscuous, and has notable activity towards nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6.







Abstract
Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93&#8201;&#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60&#8201;&#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Associated Photofluorochromism for Time&#8208;Resolved Information Encryption and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitchable dual&#8208;color fluorescent polymers (VPDFPs) show a reversible switch between green and red fluorescence. Their discoloration rate can be readily modulated by changing the feed conent of a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding UPy monomer, which can greatly improve the security of encrypted information and simplify the decryption process. These VPDFPs were applied in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and time&#8208;resolved information encryption.







Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved photofluorochromism constitutes a powerful approach to enhance information encryption security but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strategy of using hydrogen bonds to regulate the time for initiating photofluorochromism. In our strategy, copolymers containing negative photochromic spiropyran (NSP), naphthalimide, and multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding (UPy) units are designed, which display photo&#8208;switchable fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from naphthalimide donor to the NSP acceptor. Interestingly, the FRET is locked via the dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between ring&#8208;opened NSP and UPy moieties, resulting in time&#8208;dependent fluorescence. The change in fluorescence can be finely regulated via UPy fraction in the polymers. Besides the novel time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, the polymers also take advantage of visible&#8208;light triggerable, excellent photostability, photoreversibility, and processability. We demonstrate that these properties enable them many application opportunities such as fluorescent security labels and multilevel information encryption patterns.

         <title>mPatch: A Wearable Hydrogel Microneedle Patch for In Vivo Optical Sensing of Calcium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intradermal sensing platform featuring a handheld complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) sensor to detect fluorescence from aptamer&#8208;containing, transparent hydrogel embedded in the dermis. Aptamers conjugated to the hydrogel change fluorescence dynamically in response to the concentration of calcium ions in the interstitial fluid.







Abstract
This study presents an in vivo optical hydrogel microneedle platform that measures levels of analytes in interstitial fluid. The platform builds on a previously published technique for molding hydrogel microneedles by developing a composite hydrogel (i.e., PEGDA and polyacrylamide) that is sufficiently stiff to penetrate skin in the hydrated state and whose fluorescence changes dynamically&#8211;via a conjugated aptamer&#8211;depending on level of analyte. In a demonstration relevant to hypercalcemia, the hydrogel microneedle distinguished varying concentrations of calcium (within a range of 0 to 2&#8197;mM, which spans physiologically meaningful variations for hypoparathyroidism) within 10&#8197;minutes. In rats, a compact CMOS sensor measuring fluorescence from microneedles distinguished low hypercalcemic (1.7&#8197;mM) from high hypercalcemic (2.3&#8197;mM) ionized calcium levels as determined from reference blood measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates in vivo feasibility of a concept&#8211;which we call mPatch&#8211;for an optical hydrogel microneedle to measure small changes in levels of analytes in interstitial fluid, which does not rely on extraction of interstitial fluid out of the dermis.

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes to yield E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes was catalyzed by a Pd6L4 octahedral cage, with the solvent judiciously modulating the reaction, thereby unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity of the product. The dispersed metal&#8208;organic cage and the solid&#8208;state cage halted the reaction at its intermediate stage, while the aggregated supramolecular cage expedited the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization process within the confined hydrophobic nanospace.







Abstract
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking the off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8211;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.

         <title>Enabling controllable time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence in carbonized polymer dots based on chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>

Schematic illustration for the time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color characteristic in a high contrast self&#8208;protected AA&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) based on the chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding. And, the precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. It's extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize&#8208;friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self&#8208;protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L&#8208;aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545&#8197;nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA&#8211;M) with red phosphorescence at 665&#8197;nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect. And, the efficient radiative energy transfer could be proven as an intrinsic mechanism for better understanding the TDPC materials. These results further expand on the fundamental principle to design high&#8208;quality TDPC materials with more flexible regulation for luminescence properties, providing a major step forward in broadening the scope of smart phosphorescence applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti-counterfeiting. It's extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize-friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self-protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L-aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545&#8197;nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA&#8211;M) with red phosphorescence at 665&#8197;nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink-enhanced emission (CEE) effect. And, the efficient radiative energy transfer could be proven as an intrinsic mechanism for better understanding the TDPC materials. These results further expand on the fundamental principle to design high-quality TDPC materials with more flexible regulation for luminescence properties, providing a major step forward in broadening the scope of smart phosphorescence applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Sensitivity in Functional Synthetic Polymer Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Random heteropolymers based on a methyl methacrylate backbone have been shown to display protein&#8208;like properties independent of their sequence, forming compact globules with similar monomer hydration patterns and stabilization potential for bacterial phospholipase OmpLA. However, modifying the backbone chemistry introduces sequence sensitivity. These findings suggest potential in biomimicry that deviates from traditional protein paradigms.







Abstract
Recently, a new class of synthetic methyl methacrylate&#8208;based random heteropolymers (MMA&#8208;based RHPs) has displayed protein&#8208;like properties. Their function appears to be insensitive to the precise sequence. Here, through atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we show that there are universal protein&#8208;like features of MMA&#8208;based RHPs that are insensitive to the sequence, and mostly depend on the overall composition. In particular, we find that MMA&#8208;based RHPs &#8220;fold&#8221; into globules with heterogeneous hydration patterns. However, the insensitivity to sequence identity observed in MMA&#8208;based RHPs dramatically changes when we substitute the backbone architecture with acrylate or replace the oxygen atom in the side chain with a nitrogen atom (methacrylamide or acrylamide). In such scenarios, the sequence contributes significantly to the compactness and the hydration of monomers. Using principal component analysis and an intersection&#8208;over&#8208;union based index, we demonstrate that different sequences may not overlap in the property space, meaning that their properties are controlled by the sequence rather than fixed composition. We further investigate the sequence&#8208;insensitive capability of the MMA&#8208;based RHPs as previously reported on bacterial phospholipase OmpLA stabilization through heterodimerization. As experimentally observed, such polymers enhance the stability of OmpLA as reliably as its native bilayer environment. The design of such MMA&#8208;based RHPs provides a sequence&#8208;insensitive alternative to protein&#8208;mimetic biomaterials that is orthogonal to the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function paradigm of proteins.

         <title>Polysilaketals: High&#8208;Performance Polyether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Tunable Disubstituted Silane Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating silyl groups into the backbone of polyethylene oxide (PEO), the leading polymer electrolyte, via the novel anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals yielded a series of polysilaketals [P(OSiR&#8217;,R&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;2EO)] with varying steric bulk. They display competitive electrochemical properties, including the first example of a solid polymer electrolyte with higher conductivity than PEO. Moreover, unlike PEO, the amorphous nature of these polymers facilitates low temperature applications.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes exhibit higher energy density and improved safety in lithium&#8208;ion batteries relative to traditionally used liquid electrolytes but are currently limited by their lower electrochemical performance. Aiming to access polymer electrolytes with competitive electrochemical properties, we developed the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals to synthesize amorphous silicon&#8208;containing polyether&#8208;based electrolytes with varying substituent bulk of the general formula [OSi(R)2(CH2CH2O)2]n (R=alkyl, phenyl). As opposed to previously reported uncontrolled polycondensation routes toward low molecular weight polysilaketals, AROP allows access to targeted molecular weights above the entanglement threshold of the polymers. The polysilaketal with the lowest steric bulk (P(OSiMe,Me&#8208;2EO)) exceeds the conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a leading polymer electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solid polymer electrolyte to achieve this benchmark. Steric bulk in polysilaketals was found to impart stability and two bulkier polysilaketals, P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) and P(OSiMe,Ph&#8208;2EO), exhibited higher current fractions than PEO over a wide range of salt loadings. Moreover, the efficacy of P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) was competitive with that of PEO. Taken together, the tunable and competitive electrochemical properties of polysilaketals validate the systematic incorporation of silyl groups as a strategy to access high performance polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Monomeric Triarylbismuthine Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of the first monomeric hydroxytriarylbismuthonium salts and triarylbismuthine oxide. The complex exhibits O&#8208;atom transfer reactivity, an uncommon reactivity feature for Ar3Pn=O.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a bismuth&#8208;based analogue of the venerable triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO) has remained a chimera to synthetic chemists for many years, due to its predicted high reactivity and instability. Through the hydrolysis of a cationic fluorotriarylbismuthonium(V) salt, we report here the isolation of unique hydroxytriarylbismuth(V) complexes, which served as precursor for the formation of the elusive monomeric triarylbismuthine oxide Dipp3Bi=O. Combined spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provided insight into the bonding situation of the first monomeric triorganobismuth oxide complex. The Dipp3Bi=O and Mes3BiO&#8901;LiBArF complex exhibits O&#8208;atom transfer reactivity, an uncommon reactivity feature for Ar3Pn=O.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction on Cup&#8208;Stacked Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive hot electron escape driver was constructed using edge&#8208;plane sites in cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs). During the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) process, these sites exhibited a propensity to release hot electrons due to their unique geometric and electronic structure, enhancing CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes feature one&#8208;dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge&#8208;plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs&#8208;C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near&#8208;unity NIR light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Gaseous Alkanes with (Hetero)Aryl Bromides via Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic methodology for the direct cross&#8208;coupling of gaseous alkanes with (hetero)aryl bromides through the combination of metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis is reported. The method provides an efficient platform for the conversion of these abundant chemical feedstocks into high&#8208;value alkyl(hetero)arenes and bypasses the longstanding need of using preactivated alkylating agents in C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Gaseous alkanes represent the most abundant carbon&#8208;based chemical feedstocks in our planet. However, the intrinsic inertness of their C&#8722;H bonds has rendered the use of these alkanes very difficult for purposes beyond aerobic combustion and energy intensive processes. Thus, clean and energy&#8208;efficient transformations for their use in synthetic organic chemistry are still rare. Here we report a catalytic methodology for the direct cross&#8208;coupling of gaseous alkanes with (hetero)aryl bromides through the combination of metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This protocol provides an efficient platform for the addition of short alkyl groups into diverse (hetero) aromatic rings, providing a wide range of high&#8208;value alkyl(hetero)arenes, and bypassing the longstanding need of using preactivated alkylating agents in C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings. The method features high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and a remarkable functional group tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and exhibits operational simplicity

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Carbazole&#8208;Tailored Luminescent Triarylmethyl Radical and its Stable Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable triarylmethyl radical tailored with two carbazolyl groups and its corresponding stable cation was firstly synthesized and characterized. The incorporation of carbazolyl and anthryl group resulted in a near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission band peak at 1020&#8197;nm for the radical and remarkable stability for up to weeks for the cation in ambient conditions.







Abstract
The development of novel luminescent radicals, characterized by their unique doublet emission, endows a significant challenge. In this study, we reported the synthesis of a luminescent neutral radical, BCzAnM&#8208;R, tailored by two carbazolyl groups and an anthryl group to achieve a nonalternant structure. It exhibited near&#8208;infrared emission with a peak at 1020&#8197;nm in toluene. Interestingly, its corresponding cation, BCzAnM&#8208;C, was synthesized through an unconventional SnCl2&#8208;mediated reduction&#8208;aromatization&#8208;oxidation reaction in one&#8208;pot and gram&#8208;scale. The cation demonstrated remarkable stability for up to weeks in ambient conditions and facilitated the silica&#8208;gel chromatography isolation as an organic salt with SnCl3&#8722; as the counter ion. The carbazolyl groups effectively modulate molecular structures, photophysical properties, and stabilities. Notably, BCzAnM&#8208;R represents the first luminescent triarylmethyl radical with two carbazolyl groups directly attached to the central carbon.

         <title>Highly Active Photoreduction of Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 into CH3COOH over Palladium Particles on Nb2O5 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 photoreduction towards C2 fuels is realized over a catalyst with the active metal particles anchored on the metallic oxide nanosheets, wherein the interfacial electron transfer builds dual metal active sites to boost the C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
The endeavor to drive CO2 photoreduction towards the synthesis of C2 products is largely thwarted by the colossal energy hurdle inherent in C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we load active metal particles on metal oxide nanosheets to build the dual metal pair sites for steering C&#8722;C coupling to form C2 products. Taking Pd particles anchored on the Nb2O5 nanosheets as an example, the high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate the presence of Pd&#8722;Nb metal pair sites on the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal these sites exhibit a low reaction energy barrier of only 1.02&#8197;eV for C&#8722;C coupling, implying that the introduction of Pd particles effectively tailors the reaction step to form C2 products. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets achieve a CH3COOH evolution rate of 13.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in photoreduction of atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2, outshining all other single photocatalysts reported to date under analogous conditions.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;Catalyzed, Photochemical Conversion of Dehydroalanine into 4,5&#8208;Dihydroxynorvaline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin catalysis under visible light irradiation unlocks the first synthetic method for converting dehydroalanine (Dha) into 4,5&#8208;dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv). The strategy relies on hydrogen bond abstraction from a masked 1,2&#8208;diol precursor by the excited flavin catalyst and subsequent radical addition to Dha. Various peptide substrates are compatible, and a mild deprotection protocol releases the free unnatural amino acid residue.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of unnatural amino acids (UAA) is a key strategy for preparing designed peptides, including pharmaceutically active compounds. Alterations of existing amino acid residues such as dehydroalanine (Dha) are particularly important since selected positions can be addressed without the necessity of a complete de novo synthesis. The intriguing UAA 4,5&#8208;dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv) is found in a variety of naturally occurring peptides and biologically active compounds. However, no method is currently available to modify an existing peptide with this residue. We report the use of flavin catalysts and visible light irradiation for this challenge, which serves as a versatile strategy for converting Dha into Dnv. Our study shows that excited flavins are competent hydrogen atom abstraction catalysts for ethers and acetals, which allows masked 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethylene functionalization from 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The masked diol was successfully coupled to Dha residues, and a series of Dnv&#8208;containing products is reported. A mild and orthogonal protocol for deprotection of the acetal group was also identified, allowing free Dnv&#8208;modified peptides to be obtained. This method provides a straightforward strategy for Dnv functionalization, which is envisioned to be crucial for accessing natural products and synthetic analogues with pharmaceutical activity.

&lt;p&gt;Flavin catalysis under visible light irradiation unlocks the first synthetic method for converting dehydroalanine (Dha) into 4,5-dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv). The strategy relies on hydrogen bond abstraction from a masked 1,2-diol precursor by the excited flavin catalyst and subsequent radical addition to Dha. Various peptide substrates are compatible, and a mild deprotection protocol releases the free unnatural amino acid residue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical synthesis of unnatural amino acids (UAA) is a key strategy for preparing designed peptides, including pharmaceutically active compounds. Alterations of existing amino acid residues such as dehydroalanine (Dha) are particularly important since selected positions can be addressed without the necessity of a complete &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis. The intriguing UAA 4,5-dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv) is found in a variety of naturally occurring peptides and biologically active compounds. However, no method is currently available to modify an existing peptide with this residue. We report the use of flavin catalysts and visible light irradiation for this challenge, which serves as a versatile strategy for converting Dha into Dnv. Our study shows that excited flavins are competent hydrogen atom abstraction catalysts for ethers and acetals, which allows masked 1,2-dihydroxyethylene functionalization from 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane. The masked diol was successfully coupled to Dha residues, and a series of Dnv-containing products is reported. A mild and orthogonal protocol for deprotection of the acetal group was also identified, allowing free Dnv-modified peptides to be obtained. This method provides a straightforward strategy for Dnv functionalization, which is envisioned to be crucial for accessing natural products and synthetic analogues with pharmaceutical activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aryl C&#8208;H Fluorocarbonylation with CF2Br2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibromo difluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an abundant and inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8722;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals photocatalyzed, solvent tunable strategy for synthesizing fluorocarbonylated products and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. The diverse transformations of fluorocarbonylated products highlight the utility of this protocol.







Abstract
The use of abundant and inexpensive fluorine feedstocks to synthesize fluorinated compounds is a promising strategy that has not been extensively investigated. Dibromodifluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8722;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals an iridium&#8208;catalyzed, tunable strategy for synthesizing acyl fluorides and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. To achieve the desired products, this process only requires the change of solvent (from DMSO to 1,4&#8208;dioxane) under blue LED illumination. A variety of arenes and heteroarenes with electron&#8208;donating substituents were successfully used, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic experiments revealed that DMSO served a dual role, functioning as both solvent and nucleophilic reagent in C&#8722;H fluorocarbonylation.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;canonical Tryptophan Variants via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a regioselective synthesis of non&#8208;canonical tryptophan variants bearing C4&#8722;C7 substituents via Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation between simple anilines and alkynyl chlorides. This umpolung approach compared to the classic Larock indole synthesis offers a novel mechanism for heteroarene annulation and will be useful for the synthesis of complex non&#8208;canonical tryptophan moieties in a highly regioselective manner.







Abstract
Tryptophan and its non&#8208;canonical variants play critical roles in pharmaceutical molecules and various enzymes. Facile access to this privileged class of amino acids from readily available building blocks remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regioselective synthesis of non&#8208;canonical tryptophans bearing C4&#8722;C7 substituents via Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation between structurally diverse tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)&#8208;protected anilines and alkynyl chlorides readily prepared from amino acid building blocks. This transformation harnesses Boc&#8208;directed C&#8722;H metalation and demetalation to afford a wide range of C2&#8208;unsubstituted indole products in a redox&#8208;neutral fashion. This umpolung approach compared to the classic Larock indole synthesis offers a novel mechanism for heteroarene annulation and will be useful for the synthesis of natural products and drug molecules containing non&#8208;canonical tryptophan residues in a highly regioselective manner.

         <title>Exploiting Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical&#160;Material Rb2ScB3O6F2 Originated from Congruously Oriented [B3O6] Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) rare&#8208;earth metal borate fluoride Rb2ScB3O6F2 is successfully designed and synthesized, which perfectly satisfy the requirements for an excellent deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical material, including a large second harmonic generation response, a suitable birefringence, and a deep&#8208;UV frequency&#8208;doubling capability, indicating that Rb2ScB3O6F2 is capable of frequency conversion at deep&#8208;UV region.







Abstract
The exploration and research for deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are of great significance for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers. This work is based on the excellent structural [B3O6] units which manipulate the excellent performances of famous commercial NLO crystal &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 (&#946;&#8208;BBO) to explore new alternatives of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. A deep&#8208;UV rare&#8208;earth metal borate fluoride Rb2ScB3O6F2 (RSBF) is successfully designed by combining the heterovalent ions substitution strategy, and fluorination strategy. Expectedly, RSBF exhibits an extremely short cutoff edge below 175&#8197;nm (189&#8197;nm for &#946;&#8208;BBO), and a moderate birefringence of 0.088 at 1064&#8197;nm. The shortest phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength of RSBF (&#955;PM=182&#8197;nm) is shortened by 23&#8197;nm compared with &#946;&#8208;BBO (&#955;PM=205&#8197;nm) due to the improvements in the chromatic dispersion and cutoff edge, and an experimental frequency&#8208;doubling effect 1.4&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) further suggests that RSBF can output a deep&#8208;UV harmonic laser. This work provides new sights from the original influencing factors for the rational and purposeful design of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from Helical Superstructures of Chiral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular chirality drives supramolecular helicity for intrinsic circularly polarized lasing. The supramolecular microcrystals exhibit circularly polarized laser emission with deterministic chirality and high dissymmetry factors up to ~1.0.







Abstract
Chiral supramolecular aggregates have the potential to explore circularly polarized lasing with large dissymmetry factors. However, the controllable assembly of chiral superstructures towards deterministic circularly polarized laser emission remains elusive. Here, we design a pair of chiral organic molecules capable of stacking into a pair of definite helical superstructures in microcrystals, which enables circularly polarized lasing with deterministic chirality and high dissymmetry factors. The microcrystals function as optical cavities and gain media simultaneously for laser oscillations, while the supramolecular helices endow the laser emission with strong and opposite chirality. As a result, the microcrystals of two enantiomers allow for circularly polarized laser emission with opposite chirality and high dissymmetry factors up to ~1.0. This work demonstrates the chiral supramolecular assemblies as an excellent platform for high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasers.

         <title>Complexity&#8208;Building Exhaustive Dearomatization of Benzenoid Aromatics within an ESIPT&#8208;Initiated Three&#8208;Step Photochemical Cascade.</title>

Photoassisted synthesis initiated by the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer: a complexity&#8208;building photochemical cascade is developed to exhaustively dearomatize C6&#8208;benzenoid aromatics and gain rapid access to sp3&#8208;rich complex polyheterocycles. In a single experimental step, this photoinduced cascade installs eleven new stereogenic centers with high diastereoselectivity and results in a massive increase of molecular complexity, as quantified by the B&#246;ttcher molecular complexity scores.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions offer rapid access to complex 3D molecular architectures, commonly via a sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 rehybridization of two atoms of an aromatic ring. Here we report that the 6e &#960;&#8208;system of a benzenoid aromatic pendant could be exhaustively depleted within a single photochemical cascade. An implementation of this approach involves the initial dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition of the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;generated azaxylylene, followed by two consecutive [2+2] cycloadditions of auxiliary &#960; moieties strategically positioned in the photoprecursor. Such photochemical cascade fully dearomatizes the benzenoid aromatic ring, saturating all six sp2 atoms to yield a complex sp3&#8208;rich scaffold with high control of its 3D molecular shape, rendering it a robust platform for rapid systematic mapping of underexplored chemical space. Significant growth of molecular complexity&#8212;starting with a modular synthesis of photoprecursors from readily available building blocks&#8212;is quantified by B&#246;ttcher score calculations.

         <title>A Malleable Collagen&#8208;Mimic that Undergoes Moisture&#8208;Induced Hardening for Gluing Hydrophilic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A collagen&#8208;inspired helical protein&#8208;mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl&#8208; polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water&#8208;bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight&#8208;bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50&#8208;fold due to moisture&#8208;induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen&#8208;mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper. In vitro studies established the biocompatibility, making it an attractive bioinspired material for potential application as a bioadhesive.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Sulfated Zirconium Oxide is Mediated by a Sulfur&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfated Zirconium Oxide contains pyrosulfates that act as a reservoir of transiently adsorbed SO3 and sulfate. The open form of the pyrosulfate is very reactive towards C&#8722;H bonds in Ph3CH to form Ph3C+ or C&#8722;H bonds in highdensity polyethylene or isotactic polypropylene polymers to form cleavage products under hydrogenolysis conditions.







Abstract
Sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP, Mw=13.3&#8197;kDa, &#272;=2.4, &lt;mmmm&gt;=94&#8201;%) or high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE, Mn=2.5&#8197;kDa, &#272;=3.6) to branched alkane products. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites SZO, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3 and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO3 is a very strong Lewis acid that binds 15N&#8208;pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;Eads&gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene&#8208;d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 barrier to form the adsorbed SO3 and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3 between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.

We utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage.

Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26&#8201;%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Unusual Endotaxy Growth of Hexagonal Nanosheets by the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline azobenzene containing homopolymer (PAzoPMA) to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic PAzoPMA is first annealed in isopropanol to form a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets.







Abstract
A classical crystallization usually grows epitaxially from a crystal nucleus. Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline homopolymer to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic homopolymer, poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;(phenyldiazenyl)phenoxy)propyl methacrylate) (PAzoPMA), is first annealed in isopropanol to afford a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets. The energy fluctuation by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation during self&#8208;assembly confirms the packing state of PAzoPMA chains in different solvents. In isopropanol, the total energy is the lowest, demonstrating the tight regular arrangement of polymer chains. In addition, the non&#8208;bonding interaction energy is also the lowest, leading to the favorable contact with solvent molecules and the formation of hexagonal nanosheets. Otherwise, nanowires and giant large compound micelles are formed in ethanol and n&#8208;butanol, respectively. Overall, an unusual endotaxy crystallization manner of an amphiphilic homopolymer is observed during the preparation of hexagonal nanosheets, which brings fresh insight for understanding the crystallization behavior of polymers and preparing functional soft nanomaterials.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Difluoride in Oxidative Fluorination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamine&#8208;supported CoII complexes catalyzed the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons, in some instances selectively, when combined with Selectfluor and CsF, producing fluorinated products in near&#8208;quantitative yields. Mechanistic analysis supported the involvement of a CoIV&#8208;(F)2 oxidant in C&#8722;H activation and a CoIII&#8722;F F&#8208;atom donor for radical rebound.







Abstract
The heme paradigm where Fe=O acts as the C&#8722;H oxidant and Fe&#8722;OH rebounds with the formed carbon&#8208;centered radical guides the design of the prototypical synthetic hydroxylation catalyst. We are exploring methods to evolve beyond the metal&#8208;oxo oxidant and hydroxide rebound, to incorporate a wider array of functional group. We have demonstrated the application of CoII(OTf)2 (10&#8197;mol% catalyst; OTf=trimfluoromethanesulfonate) in combination with polydentate N&#8208;donor ligands (e.&#8201;g. BPMEN=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and Selectfluor in the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons in high yields. The addition of CsF to the reaction mixture induced near&#8208;quantitative yields of fluorinated saturated hydrocarbons (&gt;90&#8201;% yield of fluorinated product). For 1&#8208;hydroxy, 1&#8208;acetyl, 1&#8208;carboxy&#8208;, and 1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;adamantane, we demonstrated selective fluorination at the 3&#8208;position. We propose two mechanisms for the CoII&#8208;catalyzed reaction: either (i)&#8197;an N&#8208;radical, derived from Selectfluor, acted as the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F; or (ii)&#8197;a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F. Our combined spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical trapping evidence suggested that an N&#8208;radical was not the active oxidant. We concluded that a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the likely active oxidant and CoIII&#8722;F was the likely F&#8208;atom donor to a carbon centered radical producing a C&#8722;F bond.

         <title>BN&#8208;Acene Ladder with Enhanced Charge Transport for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit were prepared via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. In micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), these compounds demonstrate enhanced charge transport, achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which ranks among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAH&#8208;based OFETs.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth research on the charge transport properties of BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) still lags far behind studies of their emitting properties. Herein, we report the successfully synthesis of novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;PAHs (BCNL1 and BCNL2) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit, achieved via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed their unique and compact herringbone packing structures. Micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated that an enhanced charge transport capability, with BCNL2 achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8211;three orders of magnitude higher than that of BCNL1 (&#956;hmax=6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), ranking among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAHs&#8208;based OFETs. Detailed calculations attribute this significant enhancement in the hole mobility to the marked reduction in reorganization energy (&#955;) of BCNL2, resulting from the five&#8208;membered pyrrole ring annulation and molecular skeleton elongation. This work provides insight into molecular design principles for potential BN&#8208;PAHs in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Construction of Linear Tetramer&#8208;Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Efficiency and High&#8208;Stability Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully constructed two linear tetramer&#8208;type acceptor materials, G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, terminating in the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing INCN&#8208;2F. Both tetramers have molecular weights in excess of 7,000. DFT calculations and experimental results show that the fully alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 has an almost completely planar molecular structure and relatively strong crystallinity.

Abstract
Thanks to the development of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 20&#8201;%, which has met the requirements for commercialisation. In the current stage, the main focus is to balance the performance and stability. It has been shown that all&#8208;polymer formulation can improve device stability, however, PCE is not in satifsfaction, and the batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation leads to quality control issues. In this work, we constructed monodispersed tetramer NFA materials named G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, to best integrate the merits of small molecule and polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results showed that different connecting units at the centre could significantly affect the molecular planarity and thin film morphology. The alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 had a more regioregular structure, which leads to better molecular planarity, and more ordered packing in thin film. More importantly, the oligomeration induced a favourable face&#8208;on orientation, achieved a lower binding energy and exhibited a higher photoluminescence yield. As a result, the exciton and charge carrier kinetics was optimized with reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss. The OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;G&#8208;1 achieved a PCE of 19.6&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE reported so far for oligomer&#8208;based binary OSC. In addition, the device stability was largely improved, showing a lifetime over 10000&#8197;hours in the inverted OSC device.

&lt;p&gt;We have successfully constructed two linear tetramer-type acceptor materials, G-1 and G-2, terminating in the strongly electron-withdrawing INCN-2F. Both tetramers have molecular weights in excess of 7,000. DFT calculations and experimental results show that the fully alkene-bonded tetramer G-1 has an almost completely planar molecular structure and relatively strong crystallinity. In addition, G-1-based OSC achieved high PCE (19.6&#8201;%) and high stability (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into Post&#8208;Translational &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Amino Acid Formation by a Radical S&#8208;Adenosyl Methionine Peptide Splicease</title>

Noncanonical protein splicing illuminated: Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine spliceases post&#8208;translationally install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amide residues in a widespread family of peptide natural products. Here, we established the in vitro activity of a model splicease to interrogate its mechanism. The key data establish tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct to instruct our mechanistic proposal to this protease&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore.







Abstract
Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes catalyze a diverse repertoire of post&#8208;translational modifications in protein and peptide substrates. Among these, an exceptional and mechanistically obscure example is the installation of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues by formal excision of a tyrosine&#8208;derived tyramine unit. The responsible spliceases are key maturases in a widespread family of natural products termed spliceotides that comprise potent protease inhibitors, with the installed &#946;&#8208;residues being crucial for bioactivity. Here, we established the in vitro activity of the model splicease PcpXY to interrogate the mechanism of non&#8208;canonical protein splicing. Identification of shunt and coproducts, deuterium labeling studies, and density functional theory energy calculations of hypothesized intermediates support a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction at tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and release of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct. The data illuminate key features of this unprecedented radical&#8208;mediated biotransformation yielding ketoamide pharmacophores that are also present in peptidomimetic therapeutics.

         <dc:description>
A new protocol for highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and cyclobutenes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed.

Abstract
A dual photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and cyclobutenes through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such process represents an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enables selective transformation of the less sterically congested alkenes of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with cyclobutenes, incorporating a broad scope of tetrasubstituted alkenes into the cyclobutane scaffolds in up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Functionalization delivered a variety of enantioenriched cyclobutanes that are otherwise difficult to access. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the reactions proceeded through oxidative cyclization followed by protonation and protonation might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Performance and Stability of Corundum&#8208;type In2O3 Catalyst for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhombohedral polymorph of indium oxide performs better than the cubic one in terms of yield, selectivity, and stability for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. The catalyst stability and sequence of transformation from rhombohedral to cubic to metallic indium is revealed in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol is a key chemical reaction to store energy in chemical bonds, using carbon dioxide as an energy sink. Indium oxide is amongst the most promising candidates for replacing the copper and zinc oxide catalyst, which is industrially applied for syngas mixtures but less idoneous for educts with carbon dioxide due to instability reasons. The polymorph of indium oxide and the operating conditions remain to be optimized for optimal and stable performance. Indium oxide catalysts containing different rhombohedral and cubic phase ratios were synthesized using a solvothermal method and evaluated in an ideally mixed gas phase reactor. The pure rhombohedral catalyst shows the best performance in terms of yield to methanol, selectivity, and stability. The phase stability was assessed using synchrotron in situ XRD and Rietveld refinement, shedding light on the stability of the different phases at extended operating conditions. Depending on the flow rate, temperature, and hydrogen partial pressure, a rhombohedral to cubic transition occurs, ultimately yielding inactive metallic indium. If present, cubic In2O3 serves as nuclei to induce the cubic to rhombohedral transition, hampering performance. These results allow for a more rational catalyst design and fine&#8208;tuning of the operating conditions to ensure optimal and stable performance.

         <title>A BOIMPY Dye Enables Multi&#8208;Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis: Reaching Super&#8208;Reducing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals of a BOIMPY dianion made the exploration of a catalytic process that relies on consecutive multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer (multi&#8208;PET) possible. Irradiation of the dye molecule leads to an excited species that allows the reduction of strong carbon&#8208;halide bonds and arenes. The synthetic value is showcased by hydrodehalogenations, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;P bond formations, and Birch&#8208;type reductions. Thorough mechanistic investigation is presented.







Abstract
An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con&#8208;PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&gt;2 photons), termed multi&#8208;PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one&#8208;electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super&#8208;reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi&#8208;photon process which is enabled by 390&#8197;nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron&#8208;rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi&#8208;PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi&#8208;PET enabled Birch&#8208;type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.

This multi-photon process which is enabled by 390&#8197;nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon-fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron-rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon-carbon and carbon-phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi-PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi-PET enabled Birch-type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Anions Suppress Hydrogen Generation in Electrochemical CO Reduction on Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the role of halide anions in Cu catalyzed electrochemical CO reduction (eCOR). Our findings show that anions suppress the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By pairing our experimental results with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose a model wherein anions modulate the interplay between adsorbed CO* and H* at the catalyst surface, controlling the outcome of the CO reduction reaction.







Abstract
In this study, we employed electrochemical&#8208;mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF &gt; KCl &gt; KI, meaning that I&#8722; most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F&#8722; than in I&#8722;. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Klebsiella pneumoniae Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads Based on Semi&#8208;Synthetic O1 and O2ac Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans resembling lipopolysaccharides of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains O1 and O2ac were chemically synthesized. The 27 glycans were used to screen the sera of infected patients and controls for antibody binding. The glycan array study identified epitopes for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines against K. pneumoniae.







Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a common opportunistic pathogen that emerged as a new critical threat to human health, due to its hypervirulence and widespread resistance against many antibiotics, including carbapenems. Alternative intervention strategies such as vaccines are not available. Cell&#8208;surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are attractive targets for vaccine development. We present a method to synthesize LPS substructures, covering over 70&#8201;% of virulent KP strains that were used to characterize the antibody repertoire of infected patients. Thereby, glycoconjugate vaccine leads against the Klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes O1, O2a, O2afg and O2ac have been identified.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Dislocations of TiO2 Support of PdZn&#8722;ZnO Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts to Boost CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support, a dual&#8208;site catalyst with a synergistic combination of highly alloyed PdZn and hydroxyl&#8208;/oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO was developed for efficient CO2 hydrogenation, achieving the selective and robust methanol synthesis performance (9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) via deviating the reaction routes from the carboxylate pathway to formate pathway.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8722;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8722;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0&#8201;%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8&#8201;%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0&#8201;%).

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Layer Pickering Emulsion: Molecular&#8208;Level Gating of Water Delivery at Water&#8208;Oil Interface for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using H2O as a Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the as&#8208;prepared MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion, the molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF layer acted as a gate to control the mass transfer (e.g., water delivery) at water&#8208;oil interface. Hence, the water&#8208;phase hydrogenation was effectively coupled with oil&#8208;phase photocatalytic HER. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work boosts the development of biphasic catalytic system and paves a novel avenue for tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Biphasic system not only presents a promising opportunity for complex catalytic processes, but also is a grand challenge in efficient tandem reactions. As an emerging solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and water&#8208;donating hydrogenation combines the sustainability of photocatalysis and economic&#8208;value of hydrogenation. However, the key and challenging point is to couple water&#8208;soluble photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with oil&#8208;soluble hydrogenation. Herein, we employed metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and CdS nanorods to construct a MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion (water in oil, W/O), which compartmented aqueous phase for photocatalytic HER and oil phase for hydrogenation. The hydrophobic MOF and hydrophilic CdS were isolated at the inner and outer layers of W/O emulsion, respectively. The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF&#8208;CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, 30&#8197;times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24&#8201;% without co&#8208;catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top&#8208;level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water&#8208;oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.

The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF-CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 30&#8197;times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24&#8201;% without co-catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top-level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water-oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Mimic Foldamer Recognition of a Chromosomal Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular mimics are intended to outperform their natural counterparts. However, B&#8208;DNA surface mimicry to target DNA&#8208;binding proteins has long remained underdeveloped. We have introduced helical aromatic foldamers mimicking the shape and charge distribution of B&#8208;DNA that bind to some DNA&#8208;binding proteins better than DNA itself. Taking the chromosomal protein Sac7d as a model, we now provide the first structural insights into DNA mimic foldamer&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers bearing anionic side chains that mimic the overall shape and charge surface distribution of DNA were synthesized. Their interactions with chromosomal protein Sac7d, a non&#8208;sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binder that kinks DNA, were investigated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Circular Dichroism spectroscopy (CD), melting curve analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), as well as by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The foldamers were shown to bind to Sac7d better than a DNA duplex of comparable length. The interaction is diastereoselective and takes place at the DNA binding site. Crystallography revealed that the DNA mimic foldamers have a binding mode of their own and that they can bind to Sac7d without being kinked.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Combinatorial Metal Complex Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores advancements in high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis of metal complexes, emphasising their applications in catalysis, drug discovery, and materials science. We highlight various strategies for metal complex combinatorial chemistry and challenges in scalability and purity assessment. Emerging techniques such as automation and machine learning are outlined for optimising synthesis, evaluation and accelerating the discovery of metal complexes.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput combinatorial metal complex synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for rapidly generating and screening diverse libraries of metal complexes, enabling accelerated discovery in fields such as catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. By systematically combining building blocks under mild and efficient conditions, researchers can explore broad chemical spaces, increasing the likelihood of identifying complexes with desired properties. This method streamlines hit identification and optimisation, especially when integrated with high&#8208;throughput screening and data&#8208;driven approaches like machine learning. Despite challenges such as scalability and purity control, recent advancements in automation and predictive modelling are enhancing the efficiency of combinatorial synthesis, opening new avenues for the development of metal&#8208;based catalysts, therapeutic agents, and functional materials.

         <title>Scrolled Poly(L&#8208;Lactic Acid) Single Crystals via Chain End&#8208;Induced Symmetry&#8208;Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scrolled single crystals of biodegradable poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) with broken translational symmetry were obtained using solution crystallization. The scrolling mechanism was attributed to the imbalance of the fold surfaces arising from the asymmetrical distribution of the polymer chain ends, experimentally confirmed by nanoparticle decoration. This work demonstrates a new strategy for breaking crystal translational symmetry in polymer single crystals.







Abstract
Single crystals that do not obey translational symmetry have been reported in various material systems. In polymers, twisted crystals are typically formed in banded spherulites, while a class of non&#8208;flat polymer single crystals (PSCs) has been observed. Herein, we report the formation of scrolled single crystals of biodegradable polymer poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA). While classical 2&#8208;dimensional single crystals formed in solution&#8208;crystallized PLLA are flat, we show that PLLA crystals bend into scrolls when the polymer molecular weight is low. The formation of these unique scrolled PLLA single crystals depends on polymer chain ends and the polymer molecular weight. This work, therefore, demonstrates a new mechanism to break translational symmetry in PSC growth.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Upgrading to Biodegradable Plastics through Photo/Electro&#8208;Synthetic Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on innovative strategies for converting CO2 into biodegradable polymers, addressing environmental challenges like CO2 emissions and plastic waste. It explores catalytic CO2 conversion, including photocatalytic&#8208;biological and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological hybrid systems, aiming to optimize processes and catalyst efficiency.







Abstract
The escalating emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and the pervasive issue of nondegradable plastic pollution underscore dual urgent challenges in pursuit of a sustainable society. Achieving such sustainability in the plastic industry, while effectively addressing these environmental concerns, necessitates the development and implementation of innovative strategies for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers utilizing CO2 as feedstocks. The technologies not only facilitate the mitigation of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations but also introduce a renewable carbon resource for polymer manufacturing. While considerable research has been undertaken in CO2 upgrading to various C1&#8208;3 products, the production of biodegradable polymers from CO2 remains a formidable challenge. Here, we delineate the principal methodologies for catalytic CO2 upgrading to biodegradable polymers, encompassing photocatalytic&#8208;biological processes and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological approaches. The emphasis of this perspective is on the optimization of production processes and catalyst efficiency, which are paramount in addressing the imperative challenge of decarbonization in the plastic industry, thereby aligning with global environmental sustainability goals.

         <title>Cascade Selenization Regulated the Electronic Structure and Interface Effect of Transition Metal Sulfides for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, dual&#8208;effect based on electronic structure engineering and interface engineering, cascade Se substitution drives the formation of active species Se&#8722;CoS2 and CoS2/CoSe2 heterojunction. The optimized Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 delivers a high sodium storage performance in half/full cells.







Abstract
The utilization of cobalt&#8208;based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se&#8208;substituted CoS2/CoSe2, embedded within heteroatom&#8208;modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt&#8208;assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS2 markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance.

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, dual-effect based on electronic structure engineering and interface engineering, cascade Se substitution drives the formation of active species Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction. The optimized Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a high sodium storage performance in half/full cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utilization of cobalt-based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se-substituted CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, embedded within heteroatom-modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt-assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance. The elongated Co&#8722;S bonds and the formation of CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterointerface. In situ Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of interface engineering and electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 2100&#8197;cycles and 262.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 7000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Simultaneous High Current Density and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 through Intermediate Balancing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative CuBIM catalyst has a remarkable CH4 formation rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;% at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The distant Cu&#8722;Cu sites (~5.7&#8197;&#197;) in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer favor multistep *CO hydrogenation, and the proper ratio of CuO component ensures adequate *H supply, enabling high current density and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C&#8722;C coupling and H&#8722;H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu&#8208;based catalysts comprising Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu&#8722;Cu distance in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic principles for the guest&#8208;induced crystallization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were established from crystal structure data and DFT calculations of the formation energy. Suitable guests could be identified for kinetically challenging but structurally interesting HOFs. Moreover, a new HOF for p&#8208;xylene separation with molecular imprinting effect was discovered.







Abstract
Exploring host&#8211;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8211;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.

         <title>Inverting Methanol Dehydrogenation Selectivity by Crowding Atomic Ni Species over &#945;&#8208;MoC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal carbides are promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts but face challenges in controlling reaction pathways due to strong adsorption of reactants. This study shows that bare &#945;&#8208;MoC favors bimolecular methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate and H2, while Ni&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;MoC shifts selectivity to monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2. Mechanistic insights reveal Ni sites enhance C&#8722;H bond cleavage, enabling complete alcohol dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt;90&#8201;%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8722;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.

         <title>Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Assembly Facilitates the Synthesis of a [12]Cycloparaphenylene ABC&#8208;Type [3]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) represent a significant challenge for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked architectures, because they lack heteroatoms, which precludes traditional active and passive template methods. To circumvent this problem and explore the fundamental and functional properties of CPP rotaxanes and catenanes, researches have resorted to unusual non&#8208;covalent and even to labor&#8208;intensive covalent template approaches. Herein, we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring non&#8208;covalent template strategy that makes use of the surprisingly strong non&#8208;covalent inclusion of crown ethers into suitably sized CPPs. By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization and the [3]catenane topology was confirmed by NMR and MS&#8208;MS studies. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane, which are highly dependent on the protonation state of the dibenzylammonium site. This ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assembly strategy opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex CPP architectures and their use in functional supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Transport by Bambusuril&#8208;Bile Acid Conjugates: Drastic Effect of the Cholesterol Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial anion transporters offer a potential way to treat deficiencies in cellular anion transport of genetic origins. In contrast to the large variety of mobile anion carriers and self&#8208;assembled anion channels reported, unimolecular anion channels are less investigated. Herein, we present a unique example of a unimolecular anion channel based on a bambusuril (BU) macrocycle, a well&#8208;established anion receptor. The BU structure was expanded by appending various bile acid residues allowing a single molecule to span the membrane. Chloride transport mediated by BUs through lipid bilayers was investigated in liposomes and these studies revealed a surprisingly high dependence of the anion transport activity on the cholesterol content in the liposomal membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Amorphous 2D Polymer Nanodiscs with Tuneable Size, pH&#8208;Responsive Degradation and Controlled Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with tadpole&#8208;like, coil&#8208;rod architecture can be used to self&#8208;assemble into functional polymer nanodiscs directly in water. The hydrophobic segments of the BBC were tuned via the ratio of ethoxy&#8208;ethyl glycidyl ether (EE) to tetrahydropyranyl glycidyl ether (TP) within the grafted polymer sidechains. In turn, this variation controlled the sizes, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity of the self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs. Notably, as EE exhibited faster hydrolysis than TP, the nanodiscs featured variable degradation rates under mild acidic conditions, aiding small molecule release and time&#8208;dependent and complete degradation of discs into fully water&#8208;soluble copolymers. The nanodiscs demonstrated biocompatibility and cellular uptake by breast cancer cells, underscoring their potential development into drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation via Polycitric Acid&#8208;based Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in&#8208;situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8226;. In accordance with &#160;literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8226;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8226; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovering Cell&#8208;Targeting Ligands and Cell&#8208;Surface Receptors by Selection of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries against Cancer Cells without Predefined Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules that can bind to specific cells have broad applications in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Screening large chemical libraries against live cells is an effective strategy for discovering cell&#8208;targeting ligands. The DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL or DECL) technology has emerged as a robust tool in drug discovery and has been successfully utilized in identifying ligands for biological targets. However, nearly all DEL selections have predefined targets, while target&#8208;agnostic DEL selections interrogating the entire cell surface remain underexplored. Herein, we systematically optimized a cell&#8208;based DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets. A 104.96&#8208;million&#8208;member DEL was selected against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells, representing high and low metastatic properties, respectively, which led to the identification of cell&#8208;specific small molecules. We further demonstrated cell&#8208;targeting applications of these ligands in cancer photodynamic therapy and targeted drug delivery. Finally, leveraging the DNA tag of DEL compounds, we identified &#945;&#8208;enolase (ENO1) as the cell surface receptor of one of the ligands targeting the more aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Overall, this work offers an efficient approach for discovering cell&#8208;targeting small molecule ligands by using DELs and demonstrates that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral metal organic cage compounds with excellent circularly polarized luminescent performance have broad application prospects in many fields. Herein, two lanthanide complexes with luminescent properties in the form of racemic hexagonal octahedral cages were synthesized using a tri (&#946;&#8208;diketone) ligand. Eu6(C21H6F15O6)8(H2O)6 exhibited red light emission with high quantum yields of 61%. Then, we successfully synthesized lanthanide compounds with circularly polarized luminescent activity by chiral induction of the racemic mixture with arginine. The luminescence asymmetry factor was 0.53, and the circularly polarized luminescent merit figure reached 0.323. High&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescent of racemic cage like compound systems have achieved using cheap and readily available chiral amino acid molecules through chiral induction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Supporting Flexible Electrode for Tracking and Reversible Quantification of Mg2+ and Ca2+&#160;in the Brains of Freely Behaving Animal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring dynamic neurochemical signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving animals remains great challenging in biocompatibility and direct implantation capability of current electrodes. Here we created a self&#8208;supporting polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg&#8208;E and Ca&#8208;E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90 days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4&#8208;aminopyridine&#8208;induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx.

Here we created a self-supporting polymer-based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg-E and Ca-E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90 days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4-aminopyridine-induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx. Moreover, the timing of initial changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels during seizures aligned with neural pathways, which had not been previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Near&#8208;Infrared Chromisms of a Heteromerous Overcrowded Ethylene with Large Permanent Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron&#8208;accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Organonitrogen Compounds via Hydroxylamine&#8722;Mediated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a key intermediate in the formation of numerous high value&#8722;added organonitrogen compounds. The traditional synthesis of NH2OH requires the use of precious metals under high temperature conditions, which leads to high cost, high energy consumption, and environmental pollution. The NH2OH&#8722;mediated cascade reaction integrates the electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient alternative. This review presents the recent advances on electrosynthesis of high value&#8722;added organonitrogen compounds by NH2OH&#8722;mediated cascade reactions. We present key concepts and the transformation process of different N&#8722;species to NH2OH, discuss suitable substrates and electrocatalysts, and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in generating compounds such as amino acids, cyclohexanone oxime, urea, amine, etc.. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in this emerging field to encourage further research effort and the development of NH2OH&#8722;mediated cascade reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Copper Pair Sites on Inverse CeO2/Cu Catalyst Enable Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5% and a partial current density of 344.0 mA cm&#8208;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal&#8208;Group&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective I&#8208;Branching of Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine Chains Reveals Unique Binding Specificities of Proteins towards I&#8208;Antigens</title>

         <dc:description>Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (poly&#8208;LacNAc) is ubiquitously expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates, serving as the backbone of complex glycans and an extended scaffold that presents diverse glycan epitopes. The branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc, where internal galactose (Gal) residues have &#946;1&#8208;6 linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached, forms the blood group I&#8208;antigen, which is closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes including cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as many of the I&#8208;antigen sequences are undefined and inaccessible. In this study, we developed a highly efficient orthogonal&#8208;group&#8208;controlled approach to access site&#8208;selectively I&#8208;branched poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of them &#8220;caps&#8221; one internal Gal residue of poly&#8208;LacNAc. These groups can be readily &#8220;decapped&#8221; by specific enzymes or chemical reduction to expose desired sites for GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. This approach enabled the rapid preparation of a diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans from a single precursor. Glycan microarray analysis using these complex glycans revealed unique recognitions of I&#8208;branches by lectins, anti&#8208;I mAbs, and galectins. Surprisingly, oxidized forms of linear poly&#8208;LacNAc strongly bound to several glycan&#8208;binding proteins (GBPs). These findings help to bridge the gap in recognition of I&#8208;branching and open new avenues for therapeutic development by targeting galectins.</dc:description>

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce&#160;&#946;&#8209;ketoenamine&#8208;linked&#160;BDP&#8209;TFP&#8209;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8209;stacking mode with&#160;hcb&#160;topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent&#160;mesoporosity (SABET&#160;=&#160;1042&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few&#8208;layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA,&#160;qmax&#160;=&#160;426&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and Methylene Blue (MB,&#160;qmax&#160;=&#160;96&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) have been efficiently removed from H2O. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement of exfoliated&#160;BDP&#8209;TFP&#8209;COF&#160;nanosheets have been utilized for dual&#8208;mode sensing of MB or NEt3, respectively. Ultimately, the photosensitizing effect of the BODIPY units is retained in the COF. Thus,&#160;BPD&#8209;TFP&#8209;COF&#160;was established as a metal&#8208;free triplet photosensitizer, which efficiently oxidized a mustard gas simulant under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes (4.5 V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra&#8208;long cycle life at 1 C (capacity retention of 81.1% and 83.8%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8208;CH2&#8208; groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;Isochamaecydin and their Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach was developed for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of naturally occurring C30 terpene quinone methides and their non&#8208;natural stereoisomers, which feature the presence of an unprecedented spiro[4.4]nonane&#8208;containing 6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;3 hexacyclic skeleton. Resting on a chiral phosphinamide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, a concise route for the synthesis of enantioenriched 6&#8208;6 bicyclic fragment was developed. The 6&#8208;6 ring fragment and the five&#8208;membered ring fragment were unified via a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular addition reaction. Subsequently, the central 6&#8208;5 bicyclic ring system was constructed through a Michael/aldol cascade. The successful establishment of these strategic transformations allowed for an efficient and rapid construction of spiroannulated 6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;5 pentacarbocyclic core via a convergent manner. Finally, the total syntheses of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their corresponding 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;stereoisomers have been achieved divergently by appropriately orchestrating the reaction sequence including isopropyl incorporation, oxidation state adjustment, and carbonyl group&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclopropanation at a late stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing&#8208;Based Methods for the Construction of Quaternary Stereocentres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds containing quaternary stereocentres are a valuable motif in biologically active compounds. Herein we present our strategy to utilise the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones via a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity. Interestingly, benzylic alcohol substrates behaved anomalously and eliminated sulfinate in situ to give a set of rearranged &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketone products.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Cryo&#8208;sorption as a Surface&#8208;sensitive Spectroscopic Probe of the Active Site Density of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantifying the number of active sites is a crucial aspect in the performance evaluation of single metal&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. A possible realization is using adsorbing gas molecules that selectively bind to the single&#8208;atom transition metal and then probing their surface density using spectroscopic tools. Herein, using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, we detect adsorbed CO gas molecules on a FeNC oxygen reduction single atom catalyst. Correlating XPS and NEXAFS, we develop a simple surface&#8208; and chemically&#8208;sensitive protocol to accurately and quickly quantify the active site density. Density functional theory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray spectra simulations reaffirm the assignment of the spectroscopic fingerprints of the CO molecules adsorbed at Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites, and provide additional unexpected structural insights about the active site needed to explain the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption. Our work represents an important step towards an accurate quantitative catalytic performance evaluation, and thus towards developing reliable material design principles and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Crosslinked Tin Oxide Mitigating Buried Interface Defects for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin dioxide (SnO2) stands as a promising material for the electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attributed to its superlative optoelectronic properties. The attainment of superior power conversion efficiency hinges critically on the preparation of high&#8208;quality SnO2 thin films. However, conventional nanoparticle SnO2 colloids often suffer from inherent issues such as numerous oxygen vacancy defects and film non&#8208;uniformity. In this study, we report a strategy to homogenize SnO2 with reduced defects for high&#8208;performance PSCs. The commercial SnO2 colloid is modulated with bisphenol S (BPS) crosslinking to achieve a better annealing intermediate state. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on BPS bond with the hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface, passivating defects as well as promoting superb regularity of the films by forming a network of the SnO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, the sulfone groups on BPS coordinate with Pb2+, regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and FAPbI3, which leads to better interface contact at the buried interface. The FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells based on BPS&#8208;crosslinked SnO2 layers achieved a champion efficiency of 24.87% and retained 95% of their initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous light soaking under N2 atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination and Dual Interphase Regulation of MOF&#8208;Modified Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na+ conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu&#8208;MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8211; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+&#8208;O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu&#8208;MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8211; anions by Cu&#8208;MOF promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200 mA g&#8211;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid&#8208;state SMBs.</dc:description>

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal organic framework (Cu-MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu-MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8211; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+-O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu-MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8211; anions by Cu-MOF promotes the formation of inorganic-rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200 mA g&#8211;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid-state SMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as "protocells" in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8208;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7 &#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8208;200 oC) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7 mS cm&#8208;1 at 200 oC.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interplay between gasotransmitters is essential for unlocking their therapeutic potential. However, achieving spatiotemporally controlled co&#8208;delivery to target cells remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy for the intracellular co&#8208;delivery of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitters under clinically relevant wavelengths. This approach rationally couples aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a polymeric micelle platform, using palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) as both photosensitizer and photocatalyst. Notably, the photooxidation&#8208;mediated release of CO generates a local hypoxic microenvironment, which facilitates the photoredox catalyzed release of NO. This self&#8208;adaptive micelle platform enables efficient uptake by tumor cells and intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO under 630 nm light irradiation, demonstrating potent anti&#8208;tumor activity in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model via the synergistic induction of mitochondrial apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allyl&#160;amines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allyl amines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor.&#160;The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and asymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields exceeding 89%, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20:1. These chiral allyl&#160;amines can serve as versatile platforms&#160;for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilization interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Photothermal Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrates significant potential in cancer treatment, wound healing, and antibacterial therapy, with its efficacy largely depending on the performance of photothermal agents (PTAs). Metal&#8208;phenolic network (MPN) materials are ideal PTA candidates due to their low cost, good biocompatibility and excellent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer properties. However, not all MPNs exhibit significant photothermal properties, and the vast chemical space of MPNs (over 700,000 potential combinations) complicates the screening of high&#8208;photothermal materials. To address this challenge, this study introduces machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the photothermal performance of MPNs. A database of photothermal properties of 80 modular MPNs was constructed, and the ML process was optimized through feature engineering and model training. The selected extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) successfully identified 1,654 high photothermal MPNs from a virtual database of 44,438. Subsequent experimental validation revealed a remarkable success rate of 70% in predicting high photothermal MPNs. Additionally, several previously unreported high photothermal MPNs were discovered, demonstrating advantages in photothermal antibacterial applications. This study offers an innovative ML&#8208;driven approach for the efficient screening of MPN materials, providing a solid foundation for PTA design in PTT and other biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Manipulation on the Structural Defects of Poly (Triazine Imide) Single Crystals for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers, represented by polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), have risen to prominence as new&#8208;generation photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Despite considerable efforts, achieving highly crystalline PCNs with minimal structural defects remains a great challenge, and it is also difficult to examine the exact impact of complex defect states on OWS process, which largely limits their quantum efficiency. Herein, we devise a &#8216;in&#8208;situ salt flux&#8217; assisted copolymerization protocol by using nitrogen&#8208;rich and nitrogen&#8208;deficient monomers to precisely manipulate the structural defects of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) single crystals. Stoichiometric control between two comonomers enables continuous tunning of carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;vacancies within PTI, allowing the construction of a series of PTI crystals with different defect states. Theoretical and experimental results unveil the carbon vacancies are related with the radiative decay of excitons, while the nonradiative decay is mainly derived from the nitrogen vacancies. Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as&#8208;synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8% by one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.</dc:description>

Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as-synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8% by one-step-excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure-property-activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Arene&#8208;Fused [n.1.1]&#8208;Bridged Molecules via Catalytic Cycloaddition and Rearrangement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of o&#8208;QMs or p&#8208;QMs with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in combination with selective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements provides a collective approach for 6&#8197;types of medicinally attractive 2D/3D polycyclic compounds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] bridged scaffolds.







Abstract
Although great advancement has been made in synthesis of 3D bridged bicyclic[n.1.1]&#8208;bioisosteres, facile construction of 2D/3D merged molecules incorporating bridged rings, as novel chemical space in drug discovery, remains a significant challenge. Herein a collective, selective, and diversity&#8208;oriented approach for up to 6 types of 2D/3D polycyclic scaffolds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] substructure is reported. A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed [2&#963;+2&#960;] cycloaddition between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ortho&#8208;quinone methides afforded spirocyclic compounds containing a bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes unit, which were used as intermediates for synthesis of three types of 2D/3D scaffolds via judiciously controlled Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements. The reaction and rearrangement of para&#8208;quinone methides worked analogously and provided another two polycyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization, a class of configurationally stable axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole skeletons were accessed for the first time with excellent enantiocontrol. Further stereospecific elaborations of the resulting highly enantioenriched products afforded axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.







Abstract
Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8722;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8722;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the contribution of the atomic ordering strategy to the favorable reconstruction in acidic OER. The in&#8197;situ confined reconstruction layer with strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units induced by the rich strong heteroatomic bonds of Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallics (IMC) optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and suppresses the participation of lattice oxygen, thus achieving a double breakthrough in activity and stability.







Abstract
Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8197;situ/ex&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6&#8197;times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8722;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre&#8208;electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24&#8197;mgIr&#8201;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1.851&#8197;V@80&#8201;&#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000&#8197;h with the cost of USD&#8197;0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface&#8208;confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

         <title>A Lithiophilic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer Modified Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was obtained and modified onto polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the lithiophilic triazine units, this ArMT@PP simplifies the solvation structure of Li+, facilitates the migration of Li+ and forms a stable solid electrolyte interface. The assembled LMBs achieved a capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
As traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries near their theoretical limits, the advancement of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) becomes crucial for achieving higher energy densities. However, uncontrolled ion transport and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer are key factors inducing lithium dendrite growth, hindering the development of LMBs. Separator modification is an effective strategy to address the challenges of LMBs. To tackle the issues, a donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was successfully synthesized and modified onto commercial polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for LMBs. Benefitting from the highly lithiophilic triazine organic units, this ArMT exhibits affinity towards Li+ and simplifies the solvation structure of Li+ during the diffusion process, thus decreasing the ion diffusion activation energy, thereby accelerating the migration of Li+. Furthermore, triazine organic units with appropriate pore size regulate the plating/stripping behavior of lithium metal anodes, thereby facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. As a result, the assembled Li|ArMT@PP|Li symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping over 800&#8197;h. Moreover, the LiFePO4|ArMT@PP|Li cells achieved excellent cycling stability with 127.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;%. This design strategy ensures a durable and dendrite&#8208;free anode and paves the way for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined strategy for the discovery and isolation of pharmacologically relevant furan&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides is presented. Genome mining prioritizes microbes harboring specialized 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) synthases, and a reversible Fua Diels&#8211;Alder reaction enables the rapid and selective discovery and resin&#8208;based purification of Fua&#8208;bearing compounds. Two new classes of antiproliferative Fua&#8208;harboring peptides were identified in this way.







Abstract
Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity, for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and &#947;&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of Fua&#8208;containing metabolites in their native producers. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 Electrocatalyst for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in the low conversion efficiency of NO3RR. Selenium&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction is synthesized. The Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to nitrate&#8208;deoxidation and hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes water decomposition to provide H protons, which jointly promotes NO3RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; is a green and sustainable method that not only helps to treat industrial pollutants in wastewater, but also produces valuable chemicals. However, the slow dynamics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in a high barrier and low conversion efficiency. In this work, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction was synthesized, which showed excellent electrochemical performance in 0.1&#8197;M nitrate reduction reaction, superior to most currently reported catalysts. The high activity of Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 is due to the synergistic effect between FeSe2 and Fe3O4 to achieve relay catalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. Among them, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to NO3&#8722; deoxygenation and subsequent hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes H2O decomposition to provide H proton, jointly promote NO3RR. Finally, the online differential electrochemical mass spectra (DEMS), in&#8197;situ Raman and DFT calculation confirmed the optimal pathway for NO3RR to NH3 on Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4(100). This strategy of relay catalysis provides a potential way to treat wastewater with high concentration nitrate.

         <title>Breaking Performance Barriers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) Analogs by Functional Group Self&#8208;Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel KBBF&#8208;analog arsenates, CsAs2O3Br and CsAs4O6Br, have been successfully synthesized via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. These compounds set a new benchmark among KBBF&#8208;like materials, exhibiting extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (20.5&#215; KDP for CsAs2O3Br) and large uniaxial birefringence (0.26@546&#8197;nm for CsAs4O6Br), breaking performance barriers for KBBF analogs.







Abstract
Enhancing the conversion efficiency of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers through the rational design of crystal materials with superior linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a novel approach to optimizing these properties in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)&#8208;analog crystals via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. This strategy led to the synthesis of two new optical crystals: noncentrosymmetric CsAs2O3Br and centrosymmetric CsAs4O6Br. By incorporating highly optically active [AsO3]3&#8722; units into the classical 2D [Be2BO3F]&#8734;&#8722; framework, we facilitated the self&#8208;assembly of [As2O3]&#8734; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity. CsAs2O3Br exhibited an extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, 20.5 times stronger than KH2PO4 (KDP), while CsAs4O6Br demonstrated exceptional birefringence (0.26 at 546&#8197;nm), setting new performance benchmarks among KBBF analogs. Theoretical analyses reveal that these superior properties arise from the efficient alignment and high density of self&#8208;polymerized functional units. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of high&#8208;performance UV NLO materials, particularly for fourth&#8208;harmonic generation, and paves the way for future innovations in photonic technologies, including solar&#8208;blind UV laser systems and advanced photonic devices.

         <title>Cooperation of Multifunctional Redox Mediator and Separator Modification to Enhance Li&#8208;S Batteries Performance under Low Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique redox mediator (RM) molecule ethyl viologen (EtV2+), owning two well matched redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) towards redox chemistry of sulfur species, is demonstrated to function as multifunctional catalysts for reducing S, modulating Li2S nucleation and oxidizing Li2S simultaneously. Its electropositive nature in oxidation state allows the synergetic inhibition of shuttle effect of EtV2+/ EtV+ when coupling with separator modification with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups and the electrically&#8208;charged EtV2+ and LiPSs.







Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur species fundamentally trigger the incomplete conversion of S8&#8596;Li2S and restricted lifespan of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially under high sulfur loading and/or low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. Developing redox mediators (RMs) is an effective strategy to boost the battery reaction kinetics, yet their multifunctionality and shuttle inhibition are still not available. Here, a unique ethyl viologen (EtV2+) RM with two highly reversible redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) is demonstrated to well match the redox chemistry of sulfur species, in terms of accelerating the electron transfer in S8 reduction, Li2S nucleation and the Li2S oxidation. When coupling with a functionalized separator with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups, a synergetic chemistry is established to ensure the substantial inhibition of the shuttle effect and the acceleration of charge transfer. As a result, the activation energies during sulfur species conversion (S8&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;Li2S/Li2S2&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;S8) are decreased, especially for Li2S nucleation step. The correspond lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries achieve a high specific capacity of 1006.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;C; sulfur loading of 5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; E/S ratios of 6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1), and an outstanding cycling stability. This study provides a paradigm of solving complex problems via multifunctional molecule engineering and strategic cooperation towards Li&#8722;S batteries and other battery communities.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Repaired Solvation Structure Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Phosphate&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Potassium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in potassium&#8208;ion batteries are prone to excessive weak solvation. An entropic repair strategy is proposed for the solvation structure of potassium ions, and a high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with moderately weak solvation is systematically designed. The repaired electrolyte has high interface stability and ionic conductivity, and is nonflammable.







Abstract
The safety and cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are deeply associated with potassium&#8208;ion electrolytes. However, due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in PIBs are prone to excessive weak solvation. Herein, we propose an entropy repair strategy for the solvation structure of potassium ions and systematically design a moderately weakly solvated high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. The repaired electrolyte can achieve an average stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% on the Cu collector surface. The potassium symmetric battery can be stably cycled for over 10000&#8197;h under a high current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large deposition capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The potassium metal pouch cell, using K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94&#8901;0.5H2O as the cathode, maintains a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even when the current density is increased tenfold from 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery still retains 67.1&#8201;% of its capacity. Additionally, due to the introduction of multiple solvents, the potassium metal battery with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode can maintain reversible capacities of 94.0 and 77.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and operate stably at ambient temperatures of &#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Zeolite Encapsulation to Enhance Interfacial Gas Availability for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating the photocatalyst within S&#8208;1 zeolite efficiently enriched gaseous oxygen and accelerated the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 by creating a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, which significantly increased the concentration of gaseous oxygen in the microporous structure of zeolite and facilitated its interaction with the surface of the photocatalyst at the liquid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
The photocatalytic oxidation of water with gaseous oxygen is environmentally benign for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but it is currently constrained by the inadequate supply of gaseous oxygen at the catalyst surface in a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase reaction system. Herein, we address this challenge by employing the zeolite encapsulated catalysts that efficiently enrich gaseous oxygen and accelerate the H2O2 synthesis in aqueous conditions. We focus on the classical titania photocatalyst, encapsulating it within siliceous MFI zeolite crystals. This encapsulation results in a significant enhancement in H2O2 synthesis efficiency, achieving a yield that is ten times greater than that with unencapsulated TiO2. Mechanism study reveals that gaseous oxygen is notably concentrated within the microporous structure of the zeolite under aqueous conditions, thereby facilitating its interaction with the titania surface at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. In addition, the H2O2 product could swiftly transfer through the micropores, thereby reducing the side reaction of decomposition. This design provides an alternative pathway to address the poor gas solubility of gaseous reactants in water, and paves the way for advancements in various other photocatalytic processes.

A diverse range of multi&#8208;substituted &#946;/&#947;&#8208;hydroxyketones can be accessed with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity from epoxides, aryl iodides, and a simple CO source (ClCO2Pr). This electroreductive carbonylation strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance and can be applied in late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs and natural products. Notably, chiral epoxides can be employed as reactants with chirality retention, enabling the synthesis of asymmetric &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. Our approach demonstrates a novel electrochemical selectivity&#8208;controlled strategy in multi&#8208;component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#8208;Mediated Color&#8208;Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Helical Assemblies of Achiral Liquid Crystal Block Copolymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous axial chiral molecules induce helical assembly of liquid crystal block copolymers, achieving chiral transfer and amplification via non&#8208;covalent interaction and liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly. Dynamic covalent bonds of cyanostilbene groups are precisely tunable under UV light, enabling the fixation and unlocking of chiral information and color switching. This facile strategy provides guidance for visualizing chiral storage and encoding.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film attracted considerable attention in information storage and encryption, three&#8208;dimensional display, and chiral recognition. However, due to the limited molecular mobility within thin film, achieving a high asymmetry factor and non&#8208;contact modulation of CPL remain challenging. In this work, color&#8208;switchable homochiral CPL films with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum~0.11) were constructed based on the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (poly (ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly (methyl methacrylate) bearing cyanostilbene group) with axial chiral dinaphthalene diamine derivatives (R/S&#8208;DINBPA). Mechanistic investigation revealed that the efficient stacking of R/S&#8208;DINBPA with cyanostilbene groups and the liquid crystal field provide the driving force for chiral transfer and amplification. The dynamic covalent bonds of the cyanostilbene groups endow the film with chiral fixation ability and enable precise modulation of CPL luminescence bands under UV light irradiation, making it suitable for chiral patterned anti&#8208;counterfeit encryption. This facile strategy provides a general platform for designing intelligent chiroptical materials.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Mediated Highly Secondary Selective Deoxyfluorination of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane&#8208;mediated deoxyfluorination of in situ generated N&#8208;H&#8208;O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;isoureas using Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF represents a novel approach to achieve a highly 2&#176;&#8208;alcohol&#8208;selective substitution in preference to benzylic, 1&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol deoxyfluorination. The key to the 2&#176; selectivity is the relative stability of the N&#8208;BBN&#8208;O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;isoureas towards elimination of the carbodiimide.







Abstract
Organofluorine compounds are vital across multiple sectors, hence highly selective methods to install fluorine are of considerable importance. The deoxyfluorination of alcohols is a key approach to prepare organofluorine compounds, however, a highly secondary (2&#176;)&#8208;selective deoxyfluorination of alcohols has not been realized to date. Herein, we report that borane&#8208;mediated deoxyfluorination results in high 2&#176;&#8208;selectivity in inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular competition reactions versus primary (1&#176;), tertiary (3&#176;) and even benzylic (Bn) alcohols. This is an operationally simple method using only commercial reagents (e.g., Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF) that starts from the alcohol which is converted to the O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;isourea in situ. The origin of the high 2&#176;&#8208;selectivity was elucidated to be due to the relative barriers to carbodiimide elimination from the O&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;(BR2)&#8208;isoureas. As the selectivity controlling step does not involve fluoride, this borane&#8208;mediated approach can be applied to other nucleophiles, as demonstrated by 2&#176;&#8208;selective deoxychlorination using HCl occurring in preference to substitution of 1&#176; and Bn analogues. This borane&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution therefore provides a new approach to circumvent the selectivity limitations inherent in classical SN2 and SN1 type reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Organofluorine compounds are vital across multiple sectors, hence highly selective methods to install fluorine are of considerable importance. The deoxyfluorination of alcohols is a key approach to prepare organofluorine compounds, however, a highly secondary (2&#176;)-selective deoxyfluorination of alcohols has not been realized to date. Herein, we report that borane-mediated deoxyfluorination results in high 2&#176;-selectivity in inter- and intra-molecular competition reactions versus primary (1&#176;), tertiary (3&#176;) and even benzylic (Bn) alcohols.

         <title>Towards the Use of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Sources by Direct Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High active catalysts and buffered electrolytes are suggested as a prerequisite to performing CO2 reduction at low CO2 concentrations of 2&#8201;%. The suggested strategy not only enables high CO production and favorable CO2RR metrics but also contributes to decarbonization.







Abstract
The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre&#8208;concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feedstock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow&#8208;through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5&#8201;% CO2 by using NiCu&#8208;based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2&#8201;%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near&#8208;neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

         <title>Modular Access to Silicon&#8208;Containing Amino Acids and Peptides by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regioselective silylamidation that rapidly and reliably incorporates dioxazolones and silylzinc pivalates into unconjugated alkenyl amides has been disclosed, which can be further extended to the context of peptide ligation, unlocking a new platform for modular access to silicon&#8208;containing amino acid derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component silylamidation that rapidly and reliably incorporates dioxazolones and silylzinc pivalates into unconjugated alkenyl amides is disclosed. Notably, the unique power of this protocol is demonstrated by the possibility of achieving peptide ligation using peptide&#8208;containing dioxazolones or alkenyl amides as the coupling partners. Moreover, this approach is distinguished by its mild condition, synthetic simplicity, and ample scope, thus providing a new platform for modular access to silicon&#8208;containing amino acid derivatives and peptides.

         <title>Promoting Hydrogen Transfer in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via a Hydrogen on Demand Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism was proposed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, realizing the hydrogen supply matches CO2 protonation. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional &#8220;hydrogen supply&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn&#8722;N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiencies of CO &gt;90&#8201;% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 in flow cell. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2&#8722; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

         <title>Spatially Preorganized Hybridization Chain Reaction for the Prompt Diagnosis of Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially preorganized hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI&#8208;HCR) enables fast detection of nucleic acid targets. When applied to in vivo imaging of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in mice afflicted with acute gouty arthritis or sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury, TRI&#8208;HCR can diagnose inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination.







Abstract
Biological systems utilize precise spatial organization to facilitate and regulate information transmission within signaling networks. Inspired by this, artificial scaffolds that enable delicate spatial arrangements are desirable to increase the local concentration of reactants, expedite specific interactions, and minimize undesired interference. In this study, we presented an integrated biosensing nanodevice, termed TRI&#8208;HCR, in which hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes were precisely organized on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI) with finely&#8208;tuned distance, quantity, and pattern. Compared to traditional HCR in the free form, this nanodevice demonstrated increased reaction rate and signal level. We further employed the optimized TRI&#8208;HCR for in vivo imaging of a nucleic acid biomarker of inflammatory diseases. In both acute gouty arthritis (AGA) and sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury (SA&#8208;AKI) model mice, TRI&#8208;HCR was capable of diagnosing inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination. We anticipate that this precise spatial preorganization strategy for HCR holds promise for broader applications in early disease detection and monitoring.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 S&#8208;Scheme Homojunction through van der Waals Interface Regulation by Intrinsic Polymerization Tailoring&#160;for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective S&#8208;scheme homojunction relies on the precise regulation of band structure and construction of advantaged charge migration interfaces. Here, the electronic structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4 were modulated through meticulous polymerization of self&#8208;assembled supramolecular precursors. Experimental and DFT results indicate that both the intrinsic bandgap and surface electronic characteristics were adjusted, leading to the formation of an in&#8208;situ reconstructed homojunction interface facilitated by intrinsic van der Waals forces. The homojunction catalyst, composed of g&#8208;C3N4 nanodots and ultra&#8208;thin g&#8208;C3N4 nanoflakes, exhibited a significant S&#8208;scheme carrier separation mechanism, which enhances the utilization of electrons and holes. Consequently, under AM 1.5 light irradiation (~100 mW/cm2), the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst achieved a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 580 &#956;mol h&#8208;1. Furthermore, a reversed CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction was observed, yielding 80.30 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.86%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g&#8208;C3N4, which produced only 2.22 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with the 15.69% CH4 selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of chiral organic ammonium ion are arranged alternatively in the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites. The two conformers have very different strengths of non&#8208;covalent interactions at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions induces the rare helical chirality within the inorganic sublattice with interesting chiroptic properties. This conformer&#8208;mediated chirality is a novel concept.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A2PbI4 (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin&#8208;based properties. A+ organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI4]2&#8722; inorganic sublattice through non&#8208;covalent interactions at organic&#8211;inorganic interface. Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 and (S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1&#8208;iodopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti&#8208;conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2&#8722; sublattice, compared to the gauche&#8208;conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four&#8208;fold screw axes (43 and 41). The enantiomers (R&#8208;/S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 show mirror&#8208;image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer&#8208;based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular isomerization strategy was employed to develop 3D dimeric acceptors (CH8&#8208;4/4A/4B), which demonstrate varying molecular pre&#8208;aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These distinctive properties significantly affect the film&#8208;forming process and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the moderate pre&#8208;aggregation of CH8&#8208;4, an impressive efficiency of 20.0&#8201;% was received for CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based device, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non&#8208;halogenated solvents are crucial for the large&#8208;area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three&#8208;dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8&#8208;4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8&#8208;4A and CH8&#8208;4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine&#8208;sulfur non&#8208;covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre&#8208;aggregation abilities (CH8&#8208;4B&lt;CH8&#8208;4&lt;CH8&#8208;4A) in o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) solution, which significantly influence the film&#8208;forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8&#8208;4, characterized by moderate molecular pre&#8208;aggregation, achieved optimal bi&#8208;continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o&#8208;xylene processed PM6&#8201;:&#8201;CH8&#8208;4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1&#8201;%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0&#8201;% for the CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16&#8201;% for the mini&#8208;module (13.5&#8197;cm2). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>How to Easily Depolymerize Polyurethane Foam Wastes by Superbase Catalysts in Ionic Liquids Below 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, sustainable, and scalable method for the efficient depolymerization of polyurethane foam waste is presented, employing ionic liquids and superbase catalysis as reaction media at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, and highlighting the potential for industrial application of the resulting polyol.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel and sustainable approach using Ionic Liquids (ILs) as a non&#8208;innocent solvent that enhances the performance of the basic catalysts to depolymerize polyurethane foam wastes (PUFWs) through hydrolysis, alcoholysis or aminolysis under mild conditions. The system is stable, fully recoverable, and reusable. Hydrolysis of PUFWs can occur in just 2 minutes at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, producing a white polyol that is easily separated and reused in new polyurethane synthesis. The method was successfully scaled up to depolymerize 200 g of PUFW per batch (1 kg overall depolymerization system). This scalability, combined with the medium&#8216;s reusability without loss of effectiveness, highlights its strong potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: An Angstrom&#8208;Scale Protective Skin Grown In Situ on Perovskite Oxide to Enhance Stability in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxide has poor stability in aqueous reactions due to ion leaching. By one&#8208;step reduction, an angstrom&#8208;scale Fe2O3 protective skin decorated with FeNi nanoparticles was in situ grown on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948; surface. The perovskite&#8208;based catalyst with protective skin exhibits excellent activity and outstanding stability in water splitting, as reported by Guangru Zhang, Wanqin Jin et al. in their Research Article (e202417360).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water was achieved by Wolfgang Kroutil, Pawe&#322; Borowiecki, and co&#8208;workers (202420133). The cover image illustrates the cooperative action of an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (bottom left), which mediates racemization via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing mechanism (indicated by the swirl), and an acyltransferase (bottom right) that enables enantioselective acylation. This organic&#8208;solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free DKR offers a novel approach for the deracemization of sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous system using exclusively biocatalysts. The cover was designed by Verena Resch.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8211;based Vinylene&#8211;linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework with Unprecedented cya Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and realizing new topologies represent one of the most important ways toward developing new structures and functionalities for molecule&#8211;based frameworks including SOFs, MOFs, and COFs. Herein, Aldol condensation between 5,10,15,20&#8211;tetrayl(tetrakis(([1,1':3',1''&#8211;terphenyl]&#8211;4,4''&#8211;dicarbaldehyde)))&#8211;porphyrin (TTEP) and 2,4,6&#8211;trimethyl&#8211;1,3,5&#8211;triazine (TMT) affords the vinylene&#8211;linked 3D covalent organic framework Por&#8211;COF&#8211;cya. Powder X&#8211;ray diffraction (PXRD) in combination with structural simulation reveals its high crystalline structure with an unprecedented cya topology in the molecule&#8211;based frameworks reported thus far. Por&#8211;COF&#8211;cya displayed polycrystallinity and possessed high permanent porosity. Especially, the incorporation of light&#8211;harvesting porphyrin unit and vinylene linkages in Por&#8211;COF&#8211;cya enables a conjugation effect within the framework, endowing it with a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 2209 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 in pure aqueous solution under visible&#8211;light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm). Inclusion of the guest molecules TTF into the pores of Por&#8211;COF&#8211;cya results in a donor&#8211;acceptor system TTF@Por&#8211;COF&#8211;cya, enhancing the photocatalytic activity with H2O2 production rate of 6994 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1.&#160; This work paves a new way for the development of new topological functional molecule&#8211;based frameworks toward diverse application potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Polymer Interactions in Bioconjugates with Different Architectures by Structural Analysis via Time&#8208;resolved Limited Proteolysis Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic proteins are commonly conjugated with polymers to modulate their pharmacokinetics but often lack a description of the polymer&#8208;protein interaction. We deployed limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (LiP&#8208;MS) to reveal the interaction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG alternative polymers with interferon&#8208;&#945;2a (IFN). Target conjugates were digested with the specific protease trypsin and a &#8220;heavy&#8221; 15N&#8208;IFN wild type (IFN&#8208;WT) for time&#8208;resolved quantification of the cleavage dynamics. Interactions between IFN&#8208;&#945;2a and its high&#8208;affinity receptor were detailed by LiP&#8208;MS. Then, 10 kDa polymers of PEG, linear polyglycerol (LPG), and poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) (POX) with two different cyclooctyne linkers (BCN/DBCO) were used for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation to azide functionalized IFN&#8208;&#945;2a. Tryptic events at each cleavage site and in different structural environments (loops/helices) were compared. PEG and LPG were similar, and POX showed a reduced interaction profile with the IFN&#8208;&#945;2a surface. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations of IFN&#8208;DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates revealed distinct and transient (below 50 ns) protein&#8208;interaction profiles for PEG, LPG, and POX. &#160;Cleavage dynamics of IFN&#8208;polymer conjugates from the BCN handle were homogeneous, pointing to a more conserved IFN structure than DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates. In summary, time&#8208;resolved LiP&#8208;MS for quantification of cleavage events enhances the structural understanding of transient IFN&#8208;polymer interactions, which may be extended to other bioconjugate types.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric gem&#8208;Hydroboration and gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of Ynamides: A New Gateway to Chiral Fischer Carbene Complexes and their Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ynamides, when reacted with H2 or HBpin in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4, convert into chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal Fischer carbenes by regioselective gem&#8208;hydrogenation or gem&#8208;hydroboration of the polarized triple bond, respectively. gem&#8208;Hydroboration concomitantly affords a carbogenic borylated stereocenter adjacent to the ruthenium carbene unit, the configuration of which can be controlled using an Evans auxiliary. These are the first examples of asymmetric gem&#8208;addition reactions to alkynes known in the literature; representative pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes formed by this unconventional route were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic means. They undergo various stoichiometric reactions and can even entertain catalytic asymmetric transformations, such as hydrogenative cyclopropanations or a novel type of borylative cycloisomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of Sym&#8208; and Asym&#8208;Expanded Heterohelicene Isomers Exhibiting Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanded heterohelicene composing of alternating linearly and angularly fused multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton has garnered wide interest for their promising narrowband emission. Herein, a pair of sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers are firstly developed by merging boron/oxygen (B/O)&#8208;embedded MR triangulene and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units via one&#8208;shot synthesis. Owing to the fully resonating extended helical skeleton, the target heterohelicenes exhibit significantly narrowed spectra bandwidth while emission red&#8208;shifting, thus affording deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission with peak at around 460 nm, full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of merely 18 nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. In comparison with symmetrical one, the asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene displays suppressed aggregation in the doped films, thereby showcasing a superior narrowband electroluminescence in devices with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and high external quantum efficiency up to 25%, which retains 18.1% even at high luminance of 10,000 cd m&#8208;1. This is the first work achieving FWHM &lt; 20 nm in B/O&#8208;embedded [4]helicene MR derivatives, and provides a novel paradigm for the development of narrowband expanded heterohelicence.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Multivalent Assembly towards High&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Phase Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their expanded application prospects, whereas they still suffer from severe deactivation in polar media, limiting their reliability and utility. Here, we present an efficient multivalent assembly strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP). The supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules leads to extremely robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, which firmly immobilize the organic phosphors and protect triplet excitons from annihilation in high&#8208;temperature polar media, resulting in excellent HTLP emission. Moreover, the photophysical properties of HTLP are significantly enhanced by boosting multivalent interactions using multitopic phosphors, demonstrating a visible afterglow of 5.0 s in boiling water, more than 2 s in dimethylsulfoxide at 460 K (187 &#176;C), and a long lifetime of 70.3 ms in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone at 476 K (203 &#176;C). Based on their fluidity and robust HTLP emission, in&#8208;situ microcracks detection of high&#8208;temperature operating instruments and spatial&#8208;time&#8208;temperature&#8208;resolved anticounterfeiting are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ Pair Sites Based on In Situ&#8208;Exsolved Cu Nanoclusters on CaCO3 for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;based catalysts are the choice for producing multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), where the Cu0Cu&#948;+&#160;pair sites are proposed to be synergistic hotspots for C&#8208;C coupling. Maintaining their dynamic stability requires precise control over electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy, posing significant challenges. Here, we present an in&#8208;situ reconstruction strategy to create dynamically stable Cu0Cu0.18+OCa motifs at the interface of exsolved Cu nanoclusters and CaCO&#8323; nanospheres (Cu/CaCO&#8323;). In&#8208;situ XAFS analysis confirmed the low&#8208;valency state of Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR. DFT calculations demonstrated that the nanocluster size arises from the balance between metal&#8208;support interactions and Cu&#8208;Cu cohesive energy, while the dynamic stability of rich interfacial Cu&#948;+ sites is attributed to their low electron affinity and high CO32&#8208; vacancy formation energy, which collectively contribute to reduced reducibility. The transformed Cu/CaCO&#8323; exhibits an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7% at a partial current density of 393 mA cm&#8208;2, facilitated by adsorption of *CO with varying electronegativity at heterogeneous copper sites that lowers the C&#8208;C coupling energy barrier. Our findings establish insoluble carbonate as an effective anion pairing for Cu0Cu&#948;+ sites, highlighting the effectiveness of the in&#8208;situ reconstitution strategy in producing a high density of dynamically stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Poly[2]rotaxane Networks via Dynamic C&#8722;N Bond Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), a novel class of crosslinked polymers with dynamic covalent bonds, have gained significant attention for combining the durability of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, making them promising for emerging applications. Here, we report the first example of poly[2]rotaxane&#8208;type CANs&#160;(PRCANs), in which oligo[2]rotaxane backbones characterized by densely packed mechanical bonds, are cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bond. Oligo[2]rotaxane backbones could guarantee the mechanical properties of CANs. Under external force, the synergy of numerous microscopic motions of the cascade [2]rotaxane units, progressively introducing the initially hidden short chains, expands the polymer network, imparting good stretchability to the PRCANs (217%). Additionally, the dissociation of host&#8722;guest recognition, followed by the motion of mechanical bonds, constitutes a unique energy dissipation pathway, ultimately enhancing the toughness of PRCANs (7.6 MJ/m3). In contrast, the control CAN, which lacks movable mechanical bonds, demonstrates significantly lower stretchability (40%) and toughness (1.5 MJ/m3). Moreover, the dynamic C&#8722;N bond can undergo high efficiency of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole alkylation and trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchanges at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites at elevated temperatures, exhibiting good reprocessability without compromising their mechanical performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of oligo[2]rotaxane as a novel polymer backbone for the development of sustainable materials with excellent mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalized Nonbonding Orbitals of Thioxanthone in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Reduced Energy Gap and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange&#8208;red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585 nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32 nm. Notably, 2TXBN demonstrates delocalization of the nonbonding orbital within the TX segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This electronic structural adjustment effectively shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime, leading to enhanced device performance. Accordingly, OLED employing 2TXBN as the emitter achieves remarkable performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0%, a current efficiency of 69.0 cd A&#8208;1, and a power efficiency of 76.0 lm W&#8208;1, highlighting the efficacy of the nonbonding orbital delocalization strategy in achieving bathochromic&#8208;shifted narrowband OLED materials.</dc:description>
