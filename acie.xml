         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to activate elemental germanium through mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without external reducing agents. We also demonstrate the catalytic activity of elemental germanium for the first time, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes.







Abstract
In the realm of materials science and chemical industry, germanium emerges as a strategic resource with distinctive properties that extend its applicability beyond traditional electronics and optics into the promising field of chemical catalysis. Despite its significant role in advanced technological applications, the potential of elemental germanium as a catalyst remains unexplored. Leveraging recent developments in mechanochemistry, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to activate elemental germanium via mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without the reliance on external reducing agents. Meanwhile, we have also demonstrated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of elemental germanium, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes. These achievements mark a significant advancement in the field of catalysis and open up a new promising avenue for both academic research and industrial applications.

         <title>Constructing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Oxidative Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that demonstrate exceptional efficiency in H2O2 photosynthesis, coupled with the selective oxidation of organic molecules. These COFs have set a new benchmark for H2O2 production, achieving one of the highest performances reported to date. Additionally, they exhibit remarkable selectivity and yield in the oxidation of various organic substrates. This work represents a significant breakthrough in the development of COF&#8208;based photocatalytic platforms for dual&#8208;function co&#8208;production systems.







Abstract
The development of photocatalytic systems that enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 and value&#8208;added organic chemicals presents a dual advantage: generating valuable products while maximizing the utilization of solar energy. Despite the potential, there are relatively few reports on photocatalysts capable of such dual functions. In this study, we synthesized a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as JUC&#8208;675 to JUC&#8208;677, to explore their photocatalytic efficiency in the co&#8208;production of H2O2 and N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD). Among them, JUC&#8208;675 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 22.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 15.7&#8201;%, and its solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency was calculated to be 1.09&#8201;%, marking it as the most effective COF&#8208;based photocatalyst reported to date. Additionally, JUC&#8208;675 demonstrated a high selectivity (99.9&#8201;%) and yield (96&#8201;%) for BBAD in the oxidative coupling of benzylamine. The underlying reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated through validation experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the development of efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalytic platforms, offering new insights and methodologies for enhanced solar energy utilization and the synthesis of value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizer Prodrug for Self&#8208;Amplified Immune Therapy Via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work proposes a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for tumors and reports the first activatable photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis. Unlike existing combination therapies, HDIM demonstrates a significantly enhanced synergistic and cascading anti&#8208;tumor effect. Using HDIM, systemic immune activity is successfully remodeled to prevent tumor infiltration and metastasis.







Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment, but its application is hindered by tumors&#8217; low immunogenicity and the difficulty of immune cell infiltration. Here, to address above issues and achieve targeted tumor treatment, we designed the first activated small molecule photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis, and proposed a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for enhanced tumor therapy. HDIM can be specifically activated by the tumor hypoxia and then simultaneously initiate immuno&#8208;therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;induced pyroptosis with NIR laser irradiation. Mechanism study demonstrated that the immunogenicity in tumor can be significantly enhanced by HDIM&#8208;induced pyroptosis and immune cells are recruited, thus effectively amplifying the therapeutic effect of the released immune drugs. As proof of application, we have utilized HDIM for primary tumor and distant tumor therapy. And the experiment results showed that compared to current monotherapy as well as simple combination therapy, the photosensitizer prodrug HDIM exhibited much superior tumor treatment effect owing to its synchronous activation of pyroptosis and immuno&#8208;therapy in tumor.

         <title>Dynamic, Single&#8208;cell Monitoring of RNA Modifications Response to Viral Infection Using a Genetically Encoded Live&#8208;cell RNA Methylation Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor allowing for dynamically monitoring of RNA m6A modification at single&#8208;cell resolution is reported, and has been used to elucidate the interaction between host&#8208;cell RNA modifications and the infection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants.







Abstract
RNA modifications, such as N6&#8208;methylation of adenosine (m6A), serve as key regulators of cellular behaviors, and are highly dynamic; however, tools for dynamic monitoring of RNA modifications in live cells are lacking. Here, we develop a genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor that can dynamically monitor RNA m6A level at single&#8208;cell resolution. The sensor senses RNA m6A in cells via affinity&#8208;induced cytoplasmic retention using a nuclear location sequence&#8208;fused m6A reader. It allows for simultaneously measure RNA m6A dynamics and viral invasion at single&#8208;cell level. Based on the single&#8208;cell analytical tool, we found that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection enhances host&#8208;cell RNA m6A level, and high&#8208;level RNA m6A modification in host cells, in turn, facilitates viral infection. Particularly, Omicron, a variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, that features as high infection capacity, however, exhibits a reduced facilitation of m6A modification in host cells. In addition, the sensor can estimate viral inhibition via measuring cellular m6A level, that was explored for screening potential antiviral drugs. The methylation sensor can serve for elucidating the interplay between pathogens and host&#8208;cell epigenetics at single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Strained Dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane Enabled Planar Chirality Construction and [2.2]Paracyclophane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane, a benzyne analogue of [2.2]paracyclophane was realized and it could be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes. A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent alkynylation of this intermediate generated valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity. This method provides a new general platform for challenging planar chirality construction.







Abstract
Planar chirality found tremendous use in many fields, such as chemistry, optics, and materials science. In particular, planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) are a type of structurally interesting and practically useful chiral compounds bearing unique electronic and photophysical properties and thus have been widely used in &#960;&#8208;stacking polymers, organic luminescent materials, and as a valuable toolbox for developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts. However, the synthesis of chiral PCP derivatives remains a longstanding challenge. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on chiral preparative liquid chromatography separation or chemical and kinetic resolution reactions. Here, we report an enantioconvergent alkynylation of an in situ&#8208;formed dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediate by asymmetric copper(I) catalysis. This approach enables the efficient synthesis of valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. The success of this reaction lies in the development of a practical route to access strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediates, which can also be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized PCPs. DFT calculations of this reaction suggest that the enantioselectivity is determined by the aryne complexation with chiral copper(I) acetylide and the subsequent insertion reaction.

Abstract
Developing micro&#8208;/nanomotors that convert a chemical energy input into a local gradient field and motion is an appealing but challenging task that holds particular promise for the intersection of materials and nanoengineering. Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have refined these out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium chemically powered micro&#8208;/nanomotors, enabling them to orchestrate in situ chemical transformations that dynamically change local environments. The ionic products, radicals, gases, and electric fields from these active materials reshape the microenvironment, paving the way for ecofriendly disease interventions. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions that propel these energy&#8208;consuming micro&#8208;/nanomotors and elucidates the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on their potential for neural modulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. Collectively, these sketches provide a landscape of therapeutic modalities, heralding a new era of biomedicine. By harnessing the in situ product field of this active matter, we envision a paradigm shift toward active therapies that transcend conventional approaches, promising breakthroughs in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

         <title>A Strategy of Enhancing Polarization to Achieve Excellent Energy Storage Performance in Simple Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Based Relaxors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the polarization of relaxors necessitates large local polarization and high breakdown field strength. Dielectrics with low hysteresis are obtained via the chemical regulation for Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 with substantial local polarity. Large polarization is released at a high electric field, thereby achieving exceptional dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance. The mechanism of its high performance is also elucidated through the local structure analysis at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Dielectric energy storage capacitors are indispensable components in advanced electronic and electrical systems. Excellent performance requires the dielectric materials possessing low residual polarization (Pr), high breakdown strength (Eb), and large maximum polarization (Pm). The first two parameters can be typically achieved through chemical regulation, while the Pmax is closely related to the matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that a strong coupling of A&#8208;O bonds and a large lattice can enhance polarization, thus identifying the prototype Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 as a favorable matrix. Here, ultrahigh energy density of 16.5&#8197;J/cm3 and high efficiency of 88.2&#8201;% are achieved in 0.76Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;0.24Ca0.5Sr0.5HfO3 binary system. This system exhibits the highest comprehensive performance among all reported Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based ceramics. The large perovskite framework facilitated by the large ionic radius of K+ enhances the local polarity of Bi&#8722;O and Ca&#8722;O, resulting in a large Pm of 57.4&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 under an ultrahigh Eb of 82&#8197;kV/mm. The highly disordered local polar clusters at the nanoscale lead to negligible Pr and high &#951;. This work not only provides a unique design concept to enhance the comprehensive energy storage performance from the perspective of local structure, but also offers insight into the origin of high performance.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of a Dual Activatable DNAzyme Sensor in the Cavity of a DNA Nanocage for Logic&#8208;Gated Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spatially&#8208;controlled encapsulation of a dual&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor within the cavity of a DNA nanocage, a smart nanosensor is presented for correlated imaging of microRNA and metal ions. The cavity of nanocages is accessible to the dual targets, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of the DNAzyme probe, leading to improved bio&#8208;stability and imaging precision.







Abstract
Despite intense interest in design of DNAzyme sensors for molecular detection and imaging in living cells, their intracellular applications are still hampered by limited spatial control and poor bio&#8208;stability. Here we present controlled spatial confinement of a rationally designed, microRNA (miRNA)&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor probe (mDz) within the cavity of DNA nanocage, enabling efficient intracellular delivery with improved bio&#8208;stability for AND&#8208;gate molecular imaging. The mDz that possesses inactive DNAzyme activity is designed by the introduction of a blocking DNA strand, while miR&#8208;21 mediated strand displacement reaction allows for the formation of an intact DNAzyme structure for metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the DNA nanocage serves as a nanocarrier for intracellular delivery of mDz, in which the cavity is accessible to the dual targets for logic&#8208;gated molecular imaging, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of mDz by obstructing nuclease from entering the cavity of the DNA nanocage, resulting in enhanced bio&#8208;stability and improved molecular imaging precision. This strategy paves a way for the engineering of activatable DNA nanosensors with both self&#8208;delivery and self&#8208;protection capabilities to detect diverse intracellular targets.

Ultra&#8208;narrow green multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been developed by synergistic cyano&#8208;decoration and a &#960;&#8208;extension strategy. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver an exceptional green color purity that approaches the BT.2020 standard, as well as high external quantum efficiencies exceeding 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The development of pure&#8208;green organic emitters with ideal emission peaks and ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report two new green emitters, CNBN and MCNBN, which achieve extremely narrow FWHMs by synergistic rigid &#960;&#8208;extension and cyano&#8208;substitution of a sky&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core. The introduction of cyano groups induces red&#8208;shifts in the emission to the green region and dramatically minimizes the FWHMs. In toluene solution, CNBN and MCNBN exhibit narrowband emission with a maximum at 501&#8197;nm and 510&#8197;nm with ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs of 14&#8197;nm/0.066&#8197;eV and 15&#8197;nm/0.071&#8197;eV, respectively. Given the near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and almost 100&#8201;% horizontal dipole orientation, the electroluminescent (EL) devices based on CNBN and MCNBN deliver external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 30&#8201;% with FWHMs of 16&#8197;nm/0.072&#8197;eV and 17&#8197;nm/0.080&#8197;eV, respectively. Notably, the MCNBN&#8208;based device achieves pure&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 517&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.17, 0.74), closely aligning with the BT.2020 green standard.

         <title>Identification of Oligosaccharide Isomers Using Electrostatically Asymmetric OmpF Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, the OmpF nanopore, was developed for detecting unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides at low concentrations.







Abstract
Glycans, unlike uniformly charged DNA and compositionally diverse peptides, are typically uncharged and possess rich stereoisomeric diversity in the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharide units. These unique features, including charge heterogeneity and structural complexity, pose significant challenges for accurate analysis. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, OmpF nanopore. The natural electroosmotic flow within OmpF generates a robust driving force for unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides, enabling detection at a concentration as low as 6.4&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the asymmetric constriction zone of OmpF was employed to construct a stereoselective recognition site, enabling sensitive identification of glycosidic bond differences in cell lysate samples. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the OmpF nanopore achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.9&#8201;% for tetrasaccharides differing in only one glycosidic bond was achieved. This nanopore sensor provides a highly sensitive analytical tool with a broad dynamic range. It enables chiral recognition of oligosaccharides at low concentrations and is suitable for analysing both low&#8208;abundance and practical samples.

         <title>Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Hot Exciton Fluorescence and Multi&#8208;Source Excitation Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot exciton fluorescence and long afterglow emission were realized in the complexes by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly strategy. The complexes emitted bright afterglow after excited by 365&#8197;nm, 450&#8197;nm, white LED and even 800&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared laser under atmospheric conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic complexes with long afterglow luminescence have attracted extensive attention due to potential applications in display, sensing and information security. However, most of the metal&#8208;organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure&#8208;activity relationship makes the development of metal&#8208;organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near&#8208;infrared light (800&#8197;nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360&#8197;K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electric Field of an S&#8722;Scheme Heterojunction by an Ultrasonication&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Effect for Sonocatalytic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonodynamic therapy indicates advantages in combating antibiotics&#8208;resistant bacteria and deep tissue infections, but challenges remain in the less efficient charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of sonosensitizers. Herein, an effective bactericidal strategy is developed through enhancing the interfacial electric field (IEF) of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions by an ultrasonication&#8208;triggered piezoelectric effect. Hollow barium titanate (hBT) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through template etching, followed by in&#8208;situ assembly of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with Zn2+ to obtain hBT@ZnTCPP. Both experimental and theoretical evidences support the notion that an IEF is generared from ZnTCPP to hBT. Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+, the  stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn2+ coordination leads to formation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication&#8208;activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron&#8208;hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up&#8208;regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down&#8208;regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water&#8208;soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6 V LiCoO2 (93% capacity retention after 200 cycles). This strategy facilitates the decomposition of electrochemically active carboxyl groups, leading to ring opening reactions that generate numerous ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;C&#8208;) without introducing undesirable side effects on LiCoO2. The resulting components form additional charge carrier (i.e., Li+ and e&#8208;) pathways on the cathode surface. Additionally, the heating process also promotes uniform coating of the binder on the surface of LiCoO2, creating a protective layer that inhibits interfacial side reactions. Through proposing a scalable and economic manufacturing technology of multifunctional binder, this work enlightens the avenues for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa&#160;values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including aspirin's non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine's microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa&#160;predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa&#160;predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems.

         <title>Mitigating Diffusion&#8208;Induced Intragranular Cracking in Single&#8208;Crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via Extended Solid&#8208;Solution Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystal cathodes have been investigated for their inherent resistance to intergranular cracking due to the absence of grain boundaries. However, these materials exhibit significant intergranular cracking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of extended solid&#8208;solution reactions on mitigating crack formation in magnesium&#8208;doped single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (Mg&#8208;SC&#8208;LNMO) cathodes. With Mg acting as a structural pillar, the overall volume change was reduced by nearly 50%, the two&#8208;phase reaction was effectively suppressed, and the Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient was doubled. Continuum modeling based on experimental observations demonstrates that Mg doping significantly reduces the internal stress induced by lithium diffusion, thereby preserving the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO. This improvement leads to enhanced electrochemical performance and durability. Our study provides new insights into mechanically robust single&#8208;crystal cathodes and proposes a design strategy to improve the durability of next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Emissive Oligonucleotides Grafted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal and Gene Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to address the strong hydrophobicity and function limitation of NIR&#8208;II emissive phototheranostic &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), appropriate modifications are necessary to impart water dispersibility and functionality to CPs. This study uses DNA as the hydrophilic and functional unit to modify CPs, synthesizing CP&#8208;g&#8208;DNA amphiphilic copolymers and producing water&#8208;dispersible oligonucleotide&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer nanoparticles (OCPNs) by self&#8208;assembly. In addition to DNA's gene regulation abilities that can combine with the low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy of CPs for enhanced tumor therapy, OCPNs display unique characteristics as novel nanomaterials. On one side, DNA changes the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and results in a two&#8208;fold enhancement in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, which greatly benefits tumor imaging. On the other side, DNA varies the surface properties of OCPNs and the nano&#8208;bio interactions. OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft&#8208;mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal&#8208;promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>The Last Piece of the Puzzle: Access to 7&#8208;Connected Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Hexane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) exhibit a wide range of Zr6 cluster connectivities, from 3&#8208;connected to 12&#8208;connected, enabling diverse structural designs. However, odd&#8208;numbered connectivities, especially the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOFs, are exceptionally rare due to geometric symmetry challenges. To address this, we developed a geometric pre&#8208;assembly strategy to achieve targeted cluster connectivity. Using this approach, we synthesized NU&#8208;5001 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L)2]}, a Zr&#8208;MOF featuring 7&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters, derived from the precursor 6&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF, NU&#8208;5000 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H3&#8208;L)2]}. NU&#8208;5000, constructed with a tritopic chiral linker H3&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4',4''&#8208;[6'&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2'&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4',6&#8208;triyl]tribenzoic acid}, forms a (3,6)&#8208;connected ant topology. Introducing a tetratopic chiral linker, 1,1'&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol tetracarboxylic acid H4&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4',6,6'&#8208;tetrayl]tetrabenzoic acid}, enabled an additional connection, resulting in NU&#8208;5001 with a (3,4,7)&#8208;connected topology. The H4&#8208;L linker acts as either fully 4&#8208;connected or 3&#8208;connected with one arm uncoordinated. Additionally, NU&#8208;5001M {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L) (H3&#8208;L)]}, an isostructural variant, was synthesized using a mix of H3&#8208;L and H4&#8208;L linkers. NU&#8208;5001&#8217;s unique pore structure and slight flexibility enable distinct adsorption behaviors for hexane isomers, highlighting its potential for kinetic separations. This work completes the Zr6 cluster connectivity landscape and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning Zr&#8208;MOF connectivities through rational linker design, paving the way for rare, low&#8208;symmetry frameworks with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Schiff Base Complexes for Chemiluminogenic Bioprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminogenic bioimaging&#160;has&#160;emerged as a promising&#160;paradigm due to its independence from light excitation,&#160;thereby circumventing challenges&#160;related to light penetration depth and background autofluorescence. However,&#160;the availability of effective chemiluminophores&#160;remains limited,&#160;which substantially impedes&#160;their bio&#8208;applications. Herein, we discovered for the first time that cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes can&#160;unexpectedly generate chemiluminescence. Notably, the chemiluminescence reaction was rapid, with a half&#8208;life of only&#160;0.86&#160;s,&#160;significantly faster than&#160;previously reported examples. Unlike conventional chemiluminescent scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of the chemiluminogenic&#160;iridium(III)&#160;complex is its&#160;unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion upon reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly,&#160;the chemiluminogenicity of these complexes is not influenced by the cyclometalating ligands but is&#160;closely associated with the Schiff base&#160;ligand, allowing for tuning of the emission colors via&#160;altering the cyclometalating ligands. Additionally,&#160;we formulated&#160;one of the Schiff base complexes&#160;(1) as water&#8208;soluble chemiluminogenic nanoparticles (CLNPs)&#160;and successfully&#160;employed&#160;them&#160;as activatable chemiluminescence bioprobes for&#160;precise and rapid&#160;imaging of hypochlorite&#8208;related biological events&#160;both in vitro&#160;and in vivo.&#160;We&#160;believe that this significant&#160;finding of the development of chemiluminogenic Schiff base&#160;complexes will greatly&#160;facilitate the designing&#160;of innovative chemiluminophores for theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H&#8208;Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H2O2 synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dotanchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQD&#8208;C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo&#8208;catalytic synthesis rate of 5025 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; under ambient conditions. This efficiency is attributed to H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric&#8208;generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H&#8208;bonds. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto C2 sites adjacent to carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tuning proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H2O2 synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H-bond-driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dotanchored C3N5 (CQDs-C3N5) for piezo-catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQD-C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo-catalytic synthesis rate of 5025 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; under ambient conditions. This efficiency is attributed to H-bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric-generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H-bonds. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto C2 sites adjacent to carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway. Additionally, a piezo-self-Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline-rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes degradation. This study highlights the critical role of H-bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Methane Oxidation by Self&#8208;Adaptive Optimization of Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane, a major greenhouse gas and abundant carbon resource, presents significant challenges in catalysis due to its high symmetry and thermodynamic stability, which tend to cause over&#8208;oxidation to CO2. Traditional catalysts require high temperatures and pressures to facilitate CH4 conversion, constrained by their rigid structures which lack the flexibility needed for optimizing complex reaction steps. This study introduces a novel Cu single atoms&#8208;embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) based on gallium alloys, characterized by dynamic, self&#8208;adaptive structures that provide enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity. Our findings reveal that Cu&#8208;LMC achieves a high methane conversion to methanol yield (5.9 mol&#183;gCu&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) with a selectivity of 82%. The results show that mild surface oxidation significantly boosts the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;LMC by increasing active copper sites through the formation of a Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ga configuration while preserving the catalyst's structural flexibility. In&#8208;situ XPS&#160;and XAFS&#160;analyses, along with AIMD simulations, demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;LMC enables self&#8208;adaptive structural adjustments that lower methanol desorption energy and increase the energy barrier for by&#8208;product formation, optimizing the overall methane conversion process. The results underscore the importance of designing catalysts with dynamic and adaptable structures to overcome traditional limitations and improve efficiency in catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of Six Crinipellin&#8208;Type Diterpenoids through Tandem 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization/ Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crinipellins are a significant class of naturally occurring highly congested tetraquinane diterpenoids, with many members exhibiting bio&#8208;important antibacterial and anticancer activities. However, their complex structures, particularly their dense 5/5/5/5 tetracyclic frameworks, have made efficient synthesis challenging, leading chemists to attempt to create highly efficient and divergent routes. This study presents a concise, divergent synthesis of six crinipellins, completed in just 9&#8211;11 steps using commercially available materials. Particular highlights include: (1) a vital one&#8208;step 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade that rapidly constructs the angular/fused tetraquinane scaffold with two contiguous quaternary carbons, and (2) strategic functionalizations through iso&#8208;propylation, methylation, and Wacker oxidation/ dehydrogenation, enabling the divergent syntheses of the six crinipellin members without using protecting groups. This approach provides a versatile platform for accessing additional crinipellin derivatives, which we believe will benefit the medicinal and biological research.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea &#8211; LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50:1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Fully Screen&#8208;printed Perovskite Solar Cells Based on   Synergistic  Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).   However, the controllable crystallization in screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films using high &#8208; viscosity ionic liquids has been suggested to be difficult, which hampers further development of fully screen&#8208;printed perovskite devices in terms of application expansion and performance improvement. Here, we report a synergistic ripening strategy to fully control crystallization by employing methylamine propionate (MAPa) ionic liquid and water (H2O, moisture in the air). We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. MAPa effectively prevents the loss of organic salts and maintains the dispersion of Pb&#8208;I framework, preventing the perovskite component loss and decomposition. H2O and organic salts trends to form hydration complexes, which lowers the energy barrier and enhances the reactivity of the humidity&#8208;induced Ostwald ripening reaction. These improvements allow the perovskite films achieve controlled secondary growth, reducing defects and optimizing energy level alignment. The resulting fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits a record power conversion efficiency of 19.47% and an operational stability over 1,000 h with  maintaining 91.6% of the highest efficiency under continuous light stress at maximum power point.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metastable Oxygen Redox Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously harnessing cation and anion redox activities in the cathode is crucial for the development of high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability for both mechanisms remains a significant challenge due to pronounced anisotropic volume changes at low lithium content, unfavorable cation migration, and oxygen loss. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally stable cation and anion redox behavior in a metastable, cobalt&#8208;free layered oxide, Li0.693[Li0.153Ni0.190Mn0.657]O2 (LLNMO). After 50 cycles at 50 mA/g (~0.2 C), the cathode retains 97.4% of its initial capacity (222.4 mAh/g) with negligible voltage decay. This remarkable stability is attributed to its metastable rhombohedral symmetry (R&#8208;3m) with unique local structures. The face&#8208;sharing connectivity between lithium layers and alternating transition metal (TM) layers effectively suppresses TM migration&#8208;induced voltage decay during anion redox. Additionally, the structure balances interlayer cation/cation and anion/anion repulsions, resulting in minimal expansion and contraction during de&#8208;/lithiation (&lt; 2.3% along the c&#8208;axis) and excellent structural reversibility. These findings highlight that layered oxides with a metastable framework are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to NH3 (e&#8208;NO3RRA) is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive, fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The implementation of this innovative NH3 synthesis technique requires an efficient electrocatalyst and in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of e&#8208;NO3RRA. In this study, we developed an ultrathin sheet (&#181;m) iron&#8211;nickel nanoflower alloy through electrodeposition and used it for e&#8208;NO3RRA under alkaline conditions. The prepared Fe&#8211;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28 &#177; 1.36% at &#8722;238 mVRHE with an NH3 yield rate of 3999.1 &#177; 242.59 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental electrolysis, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO2&#8722; to NH3 occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long&#8208;term stability of 216 h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e&#8208;NO3RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8211;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH3 from NO3&#8722;&#8208;contaminated water.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Exciplex Mediated Multi&#8208;Color Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic long&#8208;lived phosphorescent materials demonstrating ultra&#8208;long photoluminescence have practical advantages owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the exact photophysical process underpinning the persistent&#8208;luminescent continues to elude full understanding, and the principles governing the compatibility of hosts and guests remain elusive. In this work, a new type of nonradiative energy transfer mechanism is proposed for the bi&#8208;component RTP system. Different from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter&#8208;type energy transfer, this energy transfer mechanism primarily relies on a triplet exciplex to exchange the electron. This facilitates the formation of triplet excitons that are otherwise difficult to excite directly. An evaluation methodology is devised to gauge the potential of a specific dopant&#8208;host combination toward generating pronounced afterglow. According to this framework, the enhancement of the afterglow is proportional to the decrease in the activation energy (&#916;G&#8800;) associated with the electron transfer reaction between the dopant and the host. Notably, when the &#916;G&#8800; too larger, no observable afterglow occurs, as higher &#916;G&#8800; values significantly impede the electron transfer reaction between the two components. Furthermore, the remarkable dependence of afterglow intensity on the dopant concentration renders the bi&#8208;component RTP system highly promising for applications requiring ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and broad&#8208;spectrum detection capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Catalytic Sites Grafting on 2D&#8208;Metal Oxides for Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Installing well&#8208;defined high density single&#8208;atomic catalyst (SAC) sites&#160; is highly desired for the synergistic cooperative effect in efficient chemical synthesis but elusive to synthesize due to unavoidable atomic segregation into clusters or particulates. We implemented a 2D&#8208;nanoconfined SAC grafting strategy. Inside a bilayer silica envelope, single metal hydroxide layer, pre&#8208;loaded with the catalytic metal (Pt, Pd, Ir) precursors, underwent controlled thermal conversion to the homogeneously embedded SACs decorated onto the in&#8208;situ generated 1 nm&#8208;thin transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheet. Ultranarrow confined slit&#8208;space exclusively availed laterally emerging cation vacancies of TMO host, as atomic scale sockets to capture SACs within 2D&#8208;plane while vertically restricting the atomic aggregation into nanoparticulates. High density SACs stably decorated on isolated TMO nanosheet, could be obtained in a controllable manner. Well&#8208;defined SACs on TMO were conveniently employed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of a variety of alcohols with quite high activities outperforming reported catalysts. In&#8208;depth, mechanistic investigation revealed the dramatic enhancement in acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction rates by following distinct reaction pathways (concerted or stepwise) depending on the density of SACs cooperativity effect. Such advantageous effect is distinct from the reactions on isolated metal sites in low&#8208;density SACs or nanoparticle surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meticulous deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir species onto P islands on In2O3 nanosheets demonstrates exceptional ethanol selectivity and yields in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The specific coordination of the Ir center with the P islands not only alters the electronic structure of the Ir center, optimizing the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules as well as their C&#8722;C coupling ability but also the P islands exhibit excellent H2 dissociation ability compared to the Ir single atomic site in Ir1/In2O3.







Abstract
The thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol has attracted significant interest because ethanol offers ease of transport and substantial value in chemical synthesis. Here, we present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol achieved by precisely depositing single&#8208;atom Ir species on P cluster islands situated on the In2O3 nanosheets. The Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst achieves an impressive ethanol yield of 3.33&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 914&#8197;h&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;MPa (H2/CO2=3&#8201;:&#8201;1) at 180&#8201;&#176;C, nearly 8 times higher than that of the unmodified Ir1/In2O3 catalyst. Additionally, at a more industrially relevant pressure of 5.0&#8197;MPa, the TOF of the Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst can reach up to 2108&#8197;h&#8722;1, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Combined in situ characterization and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogenation process is significantly enhanced by the Ir1&#8208;Px entities. Specifically, the Ir atom facilitates CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling, while the surrounding P island exhibits exceptional H2 dissociation ability. These three steps have been found crucial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This discovery opens new opportunities for the regulation of the microenvironment of current catalysts by providing essential chemical functionalities that enhance intricate and complex reaction processes.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polyglycerol Nanogels for Periodontitis Treatment through Antibacterial and Pro&#8208;Angiogenesis Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex is armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO). Upon pH&#8208;stimuli, the complex can disintegrate and release the TCS and DFO in situ. By promoting tissue regeneration while eliminating microbial pathogens, the nanogel complex can effectively treat persistent periodontitis.







Abstract
Periodontitis is a microbe&#8208;driven inflammatory disease leading to bone resorption and tissue destruction. We propose a dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO) for combating microbial pathogens and promoting tissue regeneration. The nanogel system (NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO) that we fabricated from linear polyglycerol exhibits well&#8208;defined spherical morphology and a positively charged surface for bacteria adhesion. The rapid and sustained degradation of NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO in the acidic environment of an infection site induces the on&#8208;demand release of TCS and DFO. The NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO shows potent bacteria elimination of the gingivitis&#8208;causing bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis in both planktonic (99.9&#8201;%) and biofilm (99&#8201;%) states. Furthermore, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO can promote vascularization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Contributing to the synergistic effect of TCS and DFO, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO demonstrates significant bone tissue regeneration and accelerated healing of periodontitis in vivo. This polyglycerol&#8208;based nanogel may therefore offer smart combined delivery of multiple therapeutics against bacteria&#8208;driven diseases.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-functional nanogel complex is armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro-angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO). Upon pH-stimuli, the complex can disintegrate and release the TCS and DFO in situ. By promoting tissue regeneration while eliminating microbial pathogens, the nanogel complex can effectively treat persistent periodontitis.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Amino Acid Crystals with Enhanced Piezoelectric Performance for Biodegradable Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy was developed to enhance the piezoelectric responses of amino acid crystals by altering their molecular dipole moment, energy band gap and charge mobility. This method significantly improved the piezoelectric coefficients, reaching 50.36&#8197;pm/V. The resulting biodegradable and implantable force sensors exhibited high sensitivity and stability, making them ideal for long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring of physiological force signals.







Abstract
Amino acid crystals have emerged as promising piezoelectric materials for biodegradable and biocompatible sensors; however, their relatively low piezoelectric coefficients constrain practical applications. Here, we introduce a fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L&#8208;tryptophan, L&#8208;phenylalanine, and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36&#8197;pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.

         <title>Forward&#8208; and Retro&#8208;Vapofluorochromism of Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials with a wide range of multicolor properties have attracted increasing attention due to their wide applications. We here report a unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior of sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals for multicolor switching through reversible amine vapor uptake and &#8220;squeeze&#8221; &#8211; induced solid&#8208;state intramolecular and intermolecular motion.







Abstract
Achieving dynamic multicolor emission through solid&#8208;state molecular motion is of significant importance for advancing applications in organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. Herein, we report macrocycle crystals with unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior, which is realized by reversible amine vapor uptake and amine&#8208;&#8220;squeeze&#8221; induced guest release. The forward&#8208;vapofluorochromism occurs when aliphatic amines penetrate guest&#8208;free macrocycle crystals to form host&#8208;guest complex crystals. These fluorescent properties can be reversibly toggled by exposing the amine&#8208;loaded crystals to another amine vapor through competitive guest replacement inside the crystals. Notably, retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism is achieved by exposing amine&#8208;loaded crystals to &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (MBA). Mechanistic studies show that MBA molecules do not penetrate the crystals, but rather &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the crystals to release loaded amines, driving the amine&#8208;loaded crystals back to the guest&#8208;free phase. The demonstrated forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism has already been successfully integrated into a highly secure five&#8208;layer information encryption system.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Temperature Optical Thermometry via Dual Sensitivity of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Lifetime and Higher&#8208;Order Phonon Anharmonicity in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K.







Abstract
Broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry necessitates materials with exceptional sensitivity and stability across varied thermal conditions, presenting challenges for conventional systems. Here, we report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The STEs PL lifetime demonstrates a highly temperature&#8208;sensitive response from 200 to 300&#8197;K, ideal for low&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate thermal sensing. In contrast, the Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K. This fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effect enhances Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, yielding a specific sensitivity (Sr) of 0.577&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at 330&#8197;K and remaining above 0.5&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at elevated temperatures. This study presents the first evidence of fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effects enhancing Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, establishing Cs2TeCl6 as a versatile candidate for broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry and opening new avenues for precise non&#8208;contact temperature sensing in advanced technological applications.

         <title>A Stable Open&#8208;Shelled Au26 Nanocluster with Remarkable Performance in Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable open&#8208;shelled Au26 nanocluster with 15 valence electrons has been synthesized, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by magnetic measurements. This cluster shows high stability and excellent catalytic performance in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, achieving a record high TON of 100670 among atomically precise gold nanoclusters.







Abstract
Open metal sites are crucial in catalysis. We have used a &#8220;loose coordination strategy&#8221; (LCS) to preorganize open metal sites in gold cluster catalysts. A gold nanocluster with composition of [Au26(3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form)9(iPr2&#8208;imy)3(Me2S)](BF4)2 (iPr2&#8208;imy=1,3&#8208;Diisopropylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form=N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;phenyl)formamidine) (Au26) has been obtained by one pot synthesis, i.e. the direct reduction of Me2SAuCl in the presence of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and amidinate ligands. ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS reveals that the Me2S ligand is detached from the cluster to form open sites. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Surprisingly, Au26 has 15 valence electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This open&#8208;shelled Au26 not only shows unexpected high stability but also exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, achieving a remarkable turnover number up to 100670.

&lt;/b&gt; has 15 valence electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This open-shelled &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; not only shows unexpected high stability but also exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, achieving a remarkable turnover number up to 100670.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Switching of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation for Orchestrating Enzyme Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple molecule comprising two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative was designed to undergo supramolecularly&#8208;regulated liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), offering a unique route to quantitively elucidating molecular&#8208;interaction variations within LLPS. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, enables facilely orchestrating enzyme kinetics.







Abstract
Dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and associated assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates play crucial roles in cellular organization and metabolic networks. These processes are often regulated by supramolecular interactions. However, the complex and disordered structures of IDPs, coupled with their rapid conformational fluctuations, pose significant challenges for reconstructing supramolecularly&#8208;regulated dynamic LLPS systems and quantitatively illustrating variations in molecular interactions. Inspired by the structural feature of IDPs that facilitates LLPS, we designed a simplified phase&#8208;separating molecule, Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap, consisting of two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative. This compound exhibits LLPS under physiological conditions, forming coacervate microdroplets that undergo multiple cycles of disassembly and reassembly upon stoichiometric addition of Cucurbit[7]uril and Adamantane, respectively, based upon competitive host&#8211;guest interactions. Importantly, such reversible control offers a unique route to quantify entropically dominant nature (&#916;S=14.0&#8197;cal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) within the LLPS process, in which the binding affinity of host&#8211;guest interactions (&#916;G=&#8722;14.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) surpass that of the LLPS of Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap (&#916;G=&#8722;2.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), enabling the supramolecular regulation process. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, provides a promising platform for either boosting or retarding enzymatic reactions, thereby orchestrating biological enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Fluorescent Artificial Receptor for Dopamine based on Molecular Recognition&#8208;driven Dynamic Covalent Chemistry in a Lipid Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic artificial receptor is introduced that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, triggering a fluorescence ratiometric response. It enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and at the single&#8208;nanoprobe level, showing remarkable selectivity without interference of competing biogenic amines and multiple biological fluids.







Abstract
Molecular recognition and detection of small bioactive molecules, like neurotransmitters, remain a challenge for chemists, whereas nature found an elegant solution in the form of protein receptors. Here, we introduce a concept of a dynamic artificial receptor that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, inducing a fluorescence response. The designed supramolecular system combines a lipophilic recognition ligand derived from a boronic acid, a fluorescent aldehyde based on push&#8208;pull styryl pyridine and a phenol&#8208;based catalyst. The recognition ligand specifically captures dopamine inside lipid nanodroplets and thus triggers imine bond formation with the aldehyde, producing the emission color change. The rational design of the fluorescent aldehyde, the catalyst, and the recognition ligand allows dramatic acceleration of the imine bond formation required for rapid sensing of dopamine. The nanoprobe enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and singe&#8208;nanoprobe imaging of dopamine gradients through its robust two&#8208;color ratiometric response. It displays remarkable selectivity without the interference of competing biogenic primary amines and biological media: blood serum, plasma, urine and cell lysate. The proposed concept of a dynamic artificial receptor offers a solution to the long&#8208;standing problem of molecular recognition and sensing of small molecules in complex biological media.

         <title>Lowering Linker Symmetry to Access Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Inverse Alkane/Alkene Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach, a tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs, in which the resulting MOFs are potential adsorbents for relatively energy efficient inverse alkane/alkene separations.







Abstract
Enriching the structural diversity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great importance in developing functional porous materials with specific properties. New MOF structures can be accessed through the rational design of organic linkers with diverse geometric conformations, and their structural complexity can be enhanced by choosing linkers with reduced symmetry. Herein, a series of Zr&#8208;based MOFs with unprecedented topologies were developed through a linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach. A tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs (denoted as NU&#8208;57, NU&#8208;58, and NU&#8208;59) by modulating synthetic conditions. Notably, the conformational flexibility and reduced symmetry of the linker generated two unprecedented topologies in NU&#8208;58 and NU&#8208;59. Furthermore, solvent removal in NU&#8208;58 via thermal activation process produced missing linker defects. Finally, the adsorption behavior of these MOFs toward alkanes and alkenes was studied to gain insights into their structure&#8211;property relationships, which demonstrated that NU&#8208;57 and NU&#8208;58 exhibit unusual reverse selectivity for alkanes in alkane/alkene separations. Overall, this work highlights the rational design of linkers using a desymmetrization strategy as a powerful method to enrich the structural diversity of MOFs and to access novel MOFs with unique properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting Dominated by Direct Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Cluster Photoexcitation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs involving photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) were constructed by carbazole dicarboxylic acid and trinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters. Direct LCCT&#8208;triggered photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) surpassed that achieved through indirect LCCT pathway. Direct LCCT was pivotal in promoting effective charge separation and transfer, maximizing the photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.







Abstract
Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single&#8208;phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well&#8208;optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism. This work not only sets a benchmark in OWS MOF photocatalysts but also paves the way for maximizing solar spectrum utilization, thereby advancing renewable hydrogen production strategy.

         <title>Valence State Hydrogen Channel Enhances Sustained and Controllable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Diabetic Skin Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a novel valence&#8208;state hydrogen channel mechanism, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the CoP catalyst under neutral conditions has been significantly improved. Based on this catalyst, a flexible device with controllable hydrogen release has been developed, effectively accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of serious health issues, including prolonged skin inflammation and delayed wound healing, owing to inferior glucose control and suppression of the immune system. Although traditional hydrogen (H2) therapy is slightly effective, its ability to tailor the release of H2 on the skin is limited. Accordingly, this study proposed a novel strategy for electrocatalytic H2 release under neutral conditions to promote wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbit. Herein, a defect&#8208;engineered cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst was designed by introducing a neutral single&#8208;metal electrocatalytic Hydrogen valence state channel into CoP. By effectively regulating the formation and transfer of *H active species during the CoP catalytic process, a considerable enhancement in neutral electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance was achieved (&#8722;78.0&#8197;mV@&#8208;10.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Based on this superior catalytic performance, we developed a flexible electrode (namely, CoP/flexible gold electrode made by screen printing (FGSP) by combining a convenient electrolysis platform with continuous electrolyte supply and FGSP, enabling customized H2 release and accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbits. Notably, the designed flexible electrode features adjustable dimensions, interchangeable substrates, and material adaptability, meeting the diverse needs of clinical and basic research and demonstrating significant potential for applications in clinical medicine.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Unprecedent Layered Perovskite&#8208;Type Heterostructure Ferroelectric via Chemical Molecular Scissor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode. This work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Precise stacking of distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rigid slabs to build heterostructures has renewed the portfolio of 2D materials, e.g., magic&#8208;angle graphene, due to the emergence of exotic physical properties. Recently, single&#8208;crystal heterostructures of layered perovskites have emerged as an exciting branch, while it remains scarce to achieve strong ferroelectricity in this new heterostructure family. Here, we present the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal, (EA3Pb2Br7)EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA=ethylamine), by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. It has notable ferroelectricity of large spontaneous polarization (Ps~5.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and high Curie temperature (Tc~375&#8197;K). Structurally, its inorganic framework adopts a unique 2D heterostructure that contains two different rigid slabs of {EA3Pb2Br7}n and {EA4Pb3Br10}n. This motif is self&#8208;assembled by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer clipping of rigid prototype sheets, using extra neopentylamine as a molecular chemical scissor. Unlike epitaxial growth, such a molecule&#8208;level stacking facilitates the growth of heterostructure single crystals. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device of 1 exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode, being the highest level of 2D perovskite ferroelectric family. Our work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Photochromic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Based on Host&#8208;Guest Strategy and Different Viologen Derivatives for Organic Amines Sensing and Information Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the design of three photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) encapsulating viologen derivatives by host&#8208;guest strategy. NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit notable reversible photochromic change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation owing to the production of intermolecular viologen radicals. Based on the excellent photochromic properties of viologens, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 enable intuitive detection of volatile amine and anticounterfeiting applications.







Abstract
The encapsulation of viologen derivatives in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct host&#8208;guest materials has been widely discussed owing to their distinctive spatial arrangement and physical/chemical properties. Herein, three new photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) have been successfully synthesized by 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) ligand as well as three different viologen derivatives based on host&#8208;guest strategy. Remarkably, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit a notable reversible photochromism change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation. The distance between the electron&#8208;deficient N atom in the viologens and the electron&#8208;rich carboxylate oxygens satisfies the electron transfer (ET) pathway, and thus ET occurs upon irradiation, producing intermolecular viologen radicals. NWM&#8208;1 is able to produce colored responses to different volatile amines by ET and can be recognizable to the naked eye. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis and comparative experiments have demonstrated that the host&#8208;guest strategy significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of viologens, thereby achieving superior amine sensing performance. NWM&#8208;2 and 3 have been realized in various applications, such as security code, fingerprint, and QR codes for anticounterfeiting. This work provides new host&#8208;guest strategy for designing highly sensitive photochromic materials and color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials, advancing the development of assembled photochromic materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Dialdehydes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axially chiral dialdehydes were synthesized via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation. The reaction proceeded smoothly by using chiral amine as the transient directing group. The detailed mechanistic studies implied that an intramolecular C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction might play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Achieving axially chiral biaryl dialdehydes through asymmetric catalysis remains significantly challenging due to the lack of efficient strategies. In this report, we developed a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation through chiral transient directing group strategy. With this new approach, a series of axially chiral amido dialdehydes were achieved in up to 86&#8201;% yields with 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er. Furthermore, detailed mechanistic studies indicated that both the imine formation and C&#8722;H bond cleavage steps were reversible. More interestingly, the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of Int&#8208;2 showed probable C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction between biaryl group and chiral amine moiety. This process offered a convenient route to access axially chiral dialdehyde derivatives. More broadly, it demonstrated a new tool through transient and C&#8722;H/&#960; synergistic interactions, which would stimulate further development of asymmetric catalytic system in enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenolysis of Biomass&#8208;Derived Aromatic Alcohols over 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene by a Reversible Redox&#8208;Relay Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CH2&#8211;OH hydrogenolysis of biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols to produce methyl aromatics is crucial for synthesizing sustainable fuels and chemicals; yet traditional metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalysis possesses significant challenges owing to its complex reaction network. Herein, a 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene was fabricated, demonstrating an efficient hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural into 5&#8208;methyl furfural, achieving an impressive yield (99.5%) at the mild reaction temperature of 90&#176;C. Catalytic mechanism investigations reveal that 2D&#8208;Mo2COx facilitate the activation and cleavage of the CH2&#8211;OH bond through a redox mechanism, driven by the strong CH2&#8211;OH affinity of the Mo&#8211;Mo metallic plane. In the absence of H2, hydrogen from O&#8211;H group is the source for methyl formation from CH2&#8211;OH. Under a H2 atmosphere, H2 is activated to remove residual oxygen species, boosting selective hydrogenolysis while suppressing furan and CH=O hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited broad universality for synthesizing methyl aromatics from various furfuryl alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and hydroxycyclopentenones. This study presents a novel redox&#8208;relay mechanism in advanced MXene catalysis, offering a straightforward hydrogenolysis pathway for challenging substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Identical Grain&#160;Atomic Force Microscopy Elucidates Facet&#8208;dependent Restructuring of Copper for CO2&#160;Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies&#160;on&#160;the catalyst restructuring during the electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction reaction (eCO2RR) are limited and mostly focused on Cu (001) or (111) single crystals as model systems. A comprehensive overview of the dynamic restructuring of&#160;the different Cu facets is lacking. Here, we&#160;first&#160;reveal the facet&#8208;dependent restructuring of polycrystalline Cu electrodes through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and identical grain atomic force microscopy (AFM). This combined analysis provides new insights into the evolution of crystal domains (EBSD) and surface topography (AFM) at varying conditions (e.g., applied potential and oxidative&#8208;reductive pulses).&#160;The statistic slope distribution function was applied to study the&#160;restructuring&#160;asymmetry on five Cu facets (i.e., planar vs. atom stepped). We find that planar Cu (001) shows a square&#8208;shaped morphology after eCO2RR with a 4&#8208;fold asymmetry restructuring behavior, while triangular features dominate on Cu (111), evidenced by surface changes with 3&#8208;fold asymmetry. 2&#8208;fold restructuring is observed for Cu (114), (212), and (124)&#160;with atom steps, resulting in forming&#160;elongated structures.&#160;Therefore,&#160;the&#160;restructuring is dominated by the asymmetry of its facet&#160;lattice structure&#160;(i.e., planar vs. atom&#8208;stepped). This work underscores the potential of combining techniques to elucidate the relationship between surface restructuring and&#160;crystal facets&#160;on different length scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Dangling Active Sites of Fe(III)&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with an oxidation state of III anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Fe(III)&#8208;N&#8208;C) delivers superior activity for catalyzing the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce CO, but its mechanism remains contentious and the commonly adopted FeN4&#8208;C model is not a conformant model for Fe(III)&#8208;N&#8208;C but for Fe(II)&#8208;N&#8208;C. Herein, employing the grand&#8208;canonical ensemble modeling with the density functional theory method benchmarked against the high&#8208;level wavefunction theory method, we first identify the conformant model for Fe(III)&#8208;N&#8208;C to be FeN1C3&#8208;C, and we then unveil that the Fe(III)N1C3&#8208;C SAC generates a novel type of dangling active site transiently under working conditions, in which the Fe single&#8208;atom leaves from the anchoring site by breaking all the Fe&#8208;C bonds but retains a stable binding to the substrate by the Fe&#8208;N bond. Thus, we further elucidate that this flexible dangling active site of Fe(III)&#8208;N&#8208;C renders a convoluted reaction network with facile CO2 activation, which delivers superior activity for eCO2RR. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the structure&#8208;activity relationship for Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and concrete insights into the design of highly active SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Extendable Synthesis of Organic Cations for In Situ Construction of Hybrid Metal Halides&#160;with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence&#160;and Strong Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The A&#8208;site organic components of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) significantly impact their crystal structure and optoelectronic properties. However, chemical modification of A&#8208;site cations has been mostly limited to commercial organic precursors, which restricts the&#160;structural variability of OIHMHs for optimal functionalities. Herein we have proposed an extendable synthesis approach to the direct procurability of various organic cations with desireable structures for the in situ construction of a library of OIHMH materials. The template condensation reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone derivatives yields A&#8208;site organic cations with exquisite control of modularization and regioselectivity within the OIHMH crystallization system. The as&#8208;fabricated OIHMHs demonstrated highly efficient linear optical photoluminescence or nonlinear optical second harmonic generation,&#160;promising potential applications in photonic devices. This in situ synthetic strategy offers a structural extension of OIHMHs and establishes a&#160;fundamental methodological platform for screening functional OIHMH materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phototransposition of Indazoles to Benzimidazoles: Tautomer&#8208;Dependent Reactivity, Wavelength Dependence, and Continuous Flow Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a detailed investigation of the photomediated transformation of indazoles to benzimidazoles through a nitrogen&#8208;carbon transposition. This phototransposition is known to occur in low yield when 1H&#8208;indazoles are subjected to high&#8208;energy UVC irradiation. The 2H&#8208;tautomer of indazole absorbs light more strongly than the 1H&#8208;tautomer at longer wavelengths. We leveraged this improved absorbance profile to develop a general system for the high&#8208;yielding conversion of N2&#8208;derivatized indazoles (prepared from the corresponding 1H&#8208;indazoles) to the corresponding benzimidazoles under UVB or UVA irradiation in up to 98% yield. Investigation of the substrate scope revealed a strong correlation between reaction yield and electron density at N2 of the indazole substrate, suggesting the importance of the availability of the lone pair at this position for reaction efficiency. In addition, evaluation of wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity through the generation of a photochemical action plot revealed that the highest conversion does not only occur at the substrate's maximum absorbance wavelength but also on its red&#8208;side, enabling the use of longer wavelength irradiation to achieve high yields. Building on these insights, a continuous flow protocol was established that enables the phototransposition on preparative scale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with high stability and porosity is a promising candidate for hydrogen separation membranes. However, most ZIF&#8208;8 polycrystalline membranes exhibit low H2/CO2 (kinetic diameters of 2.9/3.3 &#197;) mixed gas selectivity, due to the intercrystalline defects and the unprecise molecular sieving originated from framework flexibility of ZIF&#8208;8 structure with a theoretical aperture size of 3.4 &#197;. Here, inspired by nacre&#8217;s &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure, we develop mixed matrix type composite membranes in which dominant crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (bricks) are interconnected by ultrathin zinc coordination polymer interlayers (mortar) via self&#8208;assembling. Driven by coordination bonds between Zn2+ from precursor colloid and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a zinc coordination polymer network is formed to connect ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles through interactions between Zn2+ of coordination polymer and surface terminal groups on ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles, thus eliminating intercrystalline void defects and providing a highly selective H2 transport pathway. Meanwhile, the micropores and large cavities in ZIF&#8208;8 allow fast H2 transport. Benefitting from both highly selective pathway and fast H2 transport through porous ZIF&#8208;8, the optimized ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;PEI membrane exhibits a record&#8208;high H2 permeability of ~1.78&#215;105 Barrer with a high mixed gas H2/CO2 selectivity of 176, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. This bioinspired multifunctional membrane expands the scope of molecular sieving membrane.</dc:description>

Driven by coordination bonds between Zn2+ from precursor colloid and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a zinc coordination polymer network is formed to connect ZIF-8 nanoparticles through interactions between Zn2+ of coordination polymer and surface terminal groups on ZIF-8 nanoparticles, thus eliminating intercrystalline void defects and providing a highly selective H2 transport pathway. Meanwhile, the micropores and large cavities in ZIF-8 allow fast H2 transport. Benefitting from both highly selective pathway and fast H2 transport through porous ZIF-8, the optimized ZIF-8-PEI membrane exhibits a record-high H2 permeability of ~1.78&#215;105 Barrer with a high mixed gas H2/CO2 selectivity of 176, surpassing state-of-the-art performance. This bioinspired multifunctional membrane expands the scope of molecular sieving membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Methane Purification Using a Robust and Recoverable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation and purification of methane is a key step in promoting its wide application as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and an important chemical raw material. Development of single solid adsorbents simultaneously combining robust structure, high separation capacity, and easy performance recovery is highly desired but quite a challenge for realizing methane depuration. In the present study, we report an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework compound constructed from a tetracyano bithiophene&#8208;functionalized ligand. Similar to the acting principle of enzymes, multisite supramolecular interactions endow the material with not only extraordinary chemical stability in wide pH range including 12 M HCl and 20 M NaOH solutions but also highly selective recognition of acetylene and carbon dioxide over methane. The packing densities and adsorption selectivities toward acetylene and carbon dioxide are the highest reported for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its highly efficient methane purification ability from binary and even ternary mixed gases, with not only methane productivities up to 2.34 mol kg&#8208;1 but also moderate regeneration energy. Furthermore, the title compound can be easily regenerated in almost quantitative yield via simple rato&#8208;evaporation of its dichloromethane solution once its activity is attenuated or lost.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Polymerization from Monomer Mixtures to Synthesize Oxygen&#8208;Rich Block Copolymers with Dual Recyclability and Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable catalysis from monomer mixtures has been emerging as a powerful technique to synthesize various useful block copolymers, yet represents a significant challenge in polymer chemistry. Herein, we present the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers through switchable polymerization from mixtures of terminal epoxides, internal epoxides, o&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) and CO2. The exclusive chemoselectivity of terminal epoxide or internal epoxide was achieved by controlling the reaction atmosphere. The dynamic equilibrium of acetal anion and alkoxy anion is the key to the successful switch from terminal epoxides/OPA copolymerization to internal epoxides/CO2 copolymerization. Computational studies elucidated the kinetic and thermodynamic preferences underlying this selective polymerization. The acid/base labile nature of the block copolymers enables their sequence&#8208;controlled chemical recycling/degradation. These novel polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers with facilely sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization/depolymerization capabilities will enable their further tailored applications and contribute to the development of a circular plastic economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Blueshift of Mn d&#8211;d Emission Unlocked by Decreasing Phonon Coupling under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn d&#8211;d emission&#160;has been a star transition&#8208;metal activated phosphors that were extensively&#160;used in optoelectronic devices. However, due to the complex and elusive luminescence mechanism, the full potential of this material remains largely untapped. Here, we designed a core&#8208;shell structure of MnS@CdS quantum dots to investigate the effect of the internal strain on the Mn emission. Upon pressure processing, an unexpected blueshift of Mn emission was achieved. When the pressure reached a pressure of 2.1 GPa, the conventional redshift of Mn emission reappeared. Remarkable color transition from red to orange and then back to red was observed during pressure treatment. Further analysis revealed that the application of external pressure facilitated the diffusion of Mn atoms into the CdS shell, strengthened host&#8208;dopant coupling and mitigated the lattice mismatch rate within the MnS@CdS QDs. These factors resulted in a reduction in phonon coupling strength and an increase in energy transfer efficiency from the exciton of the CdS host lattice to the Mn dopants, thus ultimately accounting for the abnormal blueshift of Mn d&#8211;d emission. Our findings represent a significant breakthrough in the quest for precise control and regulation of Mn&#8208;related emission, offering&#160;insights into the underlying&#160;luminescence mechanism of Mn emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8211;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8211;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8211;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8211;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Photothermal&#8208;Driven and Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Enabled by Multifunctional Dynamic Covalent Organic Photothermal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically photothermal&#8208;responsive soft actuators possessing reconfigurability have attracted great attention due to their ability to change their actuation mode to satisfy diverse practical applications. However, challenges remain in designing and fabricating organic photothermal molecules featuring polymerizable or crosslinkable groups, especially those with multifunctional properties. Here, a novel class of versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, denoted as PUOLCE, has been developed. The multifunctional dynamic covalent organic photothermal molecules, serving as chain extenders, photothermal agents, and dynamic covalent bond precursors, are chemically bonded into LCEs, thereby endowing the LCEs with photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic properties. The intrinsic photothermal effect of PUOLCE allows the exchange reaction of dynamic oxime&#8208;carbamate bonds to undergo rapid welding under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Leveraging the NIR&#8208;assisted welding strategy, the PUOLCE&#8208;based building units are capable of assembling into various complex actuators with new deformation modes. Besides, the assembled actuators can be easily reconfigured to perform different mechanical tasks (e.g., flower blooming, grasping objects, and elevating objects) under NIR illumination. Furthermore, the PUOLCE actuators can be controlled globally or locally for light&#8208;driven locomotion by controlling the area exposed to the NIR irradiation. This work provides insights into the development of adaptive soft actuators with tunable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Energy Lights Up Europium&#8208;Based Ultra&#8208;bright Afterglow for Bioanalysis Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield&#160;(QY)&#160;and brightness hinder the use in biological&#160;applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed&#160;photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through&#160;coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts&#160;a dark state to significantly emit photons only&#160;through chemiexcitation&#160;in the process of photochemical&#160;reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the&#160;highest reported afterglow luminescence&#160;quantum yield&#160;of 27.5%. The system&#160;can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo&#160;bioimaging in&#160;living&#160;mice&#160;under&#160;mild and simple conditions&#160;(low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for&#160;in vitro&#160;diagnostic through&#160;lateral flow immunoassay, enabling&#160;the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A&#160;(SAA)&#160;and&#160;demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results.&#160;This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness&#160;of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such&#160;systems for further biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kauzmann Paradox, Supercooling, and Finding Order in Chaos</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prediction of a liquidus state with lower entropy than the corresponding solid at Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox, remains an enigma.&#160; Despite efforts to resolve this paradox for nearly 80 years, no unifying resolution has been reported. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox rely on an ideal glass transition, however, this limits the interpretation of Tkas an equilibrium critical point rather than an instability. Focusing on entropy, statistical mechanics and non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics becomes a key tenet in resolving this paradox. Expansion in phase space beyond 2D and consideration of Tk as a non&#8208;equilibrium critical point is necessary to understand the extent of liquid relaxation beyond Tk. In this review, we provide an entropic perspective of the relaxation behavior of supercooled liquids, associated expanded phase diagram, and the potential resolution to the Kauzmann paradox. This work integrates the historical evolution of our understanding of entropy/thermodynamics with modern interpretation of quantum states through renormalization group and thermodynamic speed limits.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species for localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease&#8208;specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non&#8208;specific photoactivation, causing off&#8208;target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off&#8208;target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease&#8208;specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off&#8208;target effects. This review explores the principles of activatable photosensitizers, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probe and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation. We also provide a critical assessment of unresolved challenges in aPS development, including limitations in targeting precision, selectivity under real&#8208;world conditions, and persistent issues and potential solutions (dual&#8208;lock, targeting moieties, biorthogonal chemistry and artificial receptors).</dc:description>

         <title>High Pressure Synthesis of Pr2O5 &#8211; A Unique Lanthanoid(IV) Oxide Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting praseodymium(IV) oxide with oxygen at 27&#160;GPa in a diamond anvil cell yielded the oxide peroxide Pr2IV(O2)O3, which was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on multi&#8208;grain samples, Raman spectroscopy and quantum theoretical calculations at various pressure points. The presence of tetravalent praseodymium ions is supported by electronic structure calculations, showing a band gap of ca. 1.5&#160;eV, which is consistent with the anticipated chemical model of an ionic solid. Pr2(O2)O3 thus far represents the most oxygen rich phase of any binary compound of a lanthanoid and oxygen and is the first example of a peroxide anion next to Pr4+. Additionally, these results demonstrate that instead of oxidizing the praseodymium ions past their +IV oxidation state, oxygen undergoes a comproportionation to form peroxide anions. Direct oxidation of the oxide anions by Pr4+&#8209;ions was ruled out by a control experiment in argon instead of oxygen, where no oxidation of oxide ions was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass Activity Elucidation of Cobalt&#8208;Based Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Utilizing Depth&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy in the Presence of Various Cations with Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is a kinetically sluggish reaction that requires catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity. Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is among the best performing OER catalysts and has been reported to have &#8220;bulk activity&#8221; with active sites distributed within the material. Herein, we examined the distribution of OER activity over &#956;g cm&#8722;2 loaded CoOx deposited on anti&#8208;corrosive Ti substrate in 1 M KOH with and without various cations with chloride (X&#8208;Cl, X = Li, Na, K). Depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed. In a thin sample with ~20 nm thickness, uniform oxidation was observed, but a thicker sample with ~80 nm thickness had active oxidized phases close to the surface and an unexpected inactive Co0 phase concurrently occupying about three&#8208;quarters of the CoOx layer in the depth direction, which accounted for the mass activity loss. The formation of Co0 in the bulk is attributed to the galvanic replacement reaction between CoOx and the metallic Ti substrate, which is not observed on the carbon substrate. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the type of cations rather than Cl&#8722; impacts the OER performance likely due to their interaction with superoxo species.</dc:description>

         <title>Validation and Mechanistic Studies of the Headspace Effect in MOF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of headspace volume and composition on metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) synthesis has been largely overlooked with no mechanisms currently invoking these factors. Herein, we reveal that an increased volume of oxygen in the headspace during the synthesis of zinc carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs (MOF&#8208;5, MOF&#8208;177, and IRMOF&#8208;8) as well as UiO&#8208;66 and ZJU&#8208;28 accelerates crystal formation. Investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon elucidates the critical roles played by all reagents, and some of their byproducts, in MOF synthesis. These insights are the key to developing more efficient and sustainable synthetic strategies for MOF production.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Production of a DNA Decoy Catalyzed by Intracellular MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA decoys are expected to be among the nucleic acid drugs used to downregulate the transcription process. However, spatially controlling the on/off efficacy of DNA decoys to avoid side effects on normal cells is challenging. To reduce undesired decoy function in normal cells, we adopted catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to produce a DNA duplex from a hairpin DNA pair in response to a specific microRNA (miRNA). We designed the DNA hairpin pairs to form a DNA decoy that binds to NF&#8208;kB, whose overexpression is related to many diseases, including cancer. The transformation of the DNA hairpin pair to the NF&#8208;kB DNA decoy was catalyzed by miR&#8208;21. Intracellular CHA progression and the inhibitory effect against NF&#8208;kB were observed only in miR&#8208;21 overexpressing cancer cells. The intracellular miR&#8208;21&#8208;catalyzed production of the NF&#8208;kB DNA decoy has the potential to reduce side effects on normal cells, thereby strengthening the therapeutic profile of the CHA&#8208;decoy system. This study is the first to use the CHA product itself as a selective therapeutic substance. The ability to customize the combination of catalytic miRNA and target transcription factors would allow our technology to serve as a &#8220;personalized drug discovery system&#8221; for a variety of challenging diseases, including cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Polymer Interphase with Fast Kinetics for Ultrahigh&#8208;rate Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer interphase on Zn anodes obviates dendrite growth and side reactions, however has drawbacks of slow kinetics. Here, a multifunctional polymer interphase with fast kinectics is reported, using poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) as an electrolyte additive. PPPA, with linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and enriched polar pyridine (conjugated cyclic &#8208;C=N&#8208;) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode to form a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interpahse (SEI) layer in&#8208;situ. The PPPA SEI is efficient to block direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode, and regulate the interfacial solvation structure and Zn depostion. Importantly, the expanding &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of PPPA is shown to provide abundant 2D open channels for rapid Zn2+ transport, and the delocalized &#960; electrons form a space electrostatic field to facilitate de&#8208;solvation and diffusion of Zn2+. As a result, the Zn metal anode with PPPA/ZnSO4 electrolyte exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% at current density of 20 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent cycle lifespan for over 2000 cycles (400 h) at current density 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and plating/stripping capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polymer interphase on Zn anodes obviates dendrite growth and side reactions, however has drawbacks of slow kinetics. Here, a multifunctional polymer interphase with fast kinectics is reported, using poly(phenazine-alt-pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) as an electrolyte additive. PPPA, with linear &#960;-conjugated structure and enriched polar pyridine (conjugated cyclic -C=N-) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode to form a stable solid-electrolyte interpahse (SEI) layer in-situ. The PPPA SEI is efficient to block direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode, and regulate the interfacial solvation structure and Zn depostion. Importantly, the expanding &#960;-conjugated structure of PPPA is shown to provide abundant 2D open channels for rapid Zn2+ transport, and the delocalized &#960; electrons form a space electrostatic field to facilitate de-solvation and diffusion of Zn2+. As a result, the Zn metal anode with PPPA/ZnSO4 electrolyte exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% at current density of 20 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent cycle lifespan for over 2000 cycles (400 h) at current density 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and plating/stripping capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Intra&#8208;Nanopore Charge Microenvironment in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Monovalent Cation Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charged channels are considered an effective design for achieving efficient monovalent cation transport; however, it remains challenging to establish a direct relationship between charge microenvironments and ionic conductivity within the pores. Herein, we report a series of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with identical skeletons but different charge microenvironments and explore their intra&#8208;pore charge&#8208;driven ion transport performance and mechanism differences. We found that the charged nature determines ion&#8208;pair action sites, modes, host&#8208;guest interaction, thereby influencing the dissociation efficiency of ion pairs, the hopping ability of cations, and the effective carrier concentration. The order of transport efficiency for Li+, Na+, and H+ follows anion &gt; zwitterion &gt; cation &gt; neutrality. Ionic COFs exhibit up to 11&#8208;fold higher ionic conductivity than neutral COFs. Notably, the ionic conductivity of anionic COF achieves 2.0&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 for Li+ at 30&#176;C and 3.8&#215;10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1 for H+ at 160&#176;C, surpassing most COF&#8208;based ionic conductors. This COF platform for efficient ion migration and stable battery cycling in lithium&#8208;metal quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries has also been verified as proof of concept. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Innovative asymmetric CoSA&#8208;N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx catalysis: unleashing superoxide radicals for rapid self&#8208;coupling removal of phenolic pollutant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polymerization pathway of contaminants rivals the traditional mineralization pathway in water purification technologies. However, designing suitable oxidative environments to steer contaminants toward polymerization remains challenging. This study introduces a nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy to create an asymmetrical microenvironment for Co atoms on Ti3C2Tx MXenes, resulting in a novel Co&#8208;N2O3 microcellular structure that efficiently activates peroxymonosulfate. This unique activation capability led to the complete removal of various phenolic pollutants within 3 min, outperforming the representative Co single&#8208;atom catalysts reported in the past three years. Identifying and recognizing reactive oxygen species highlight the crucial role of &#183;O2&#8722;. The efficient pollutant removal occurs through a &#183;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich pollutants transfer more electrons to the catalyst surface, inducing the reduction of dissolved oxygen to &#183;O2&#8722; in the Co&#8208;N2O3 microregion. In a practical continuous flow&#8208;through application, the system achieved 100% acetaminophen removal efficiency in 6.5 h, with a hydraulic retention time of just 0.98 s. This study provides new insights into the previously underappreciated role of &#183;O2&#8722; in pollutant purification, offering a simple strategy for advancing aggregation removal technology in the field of wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Assisted Solubilization Strategy&#160;in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ions migration and de&#8208;doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li+ ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de&#8208;doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode. Consequently, benefiting from tBP removement and inhibited ions migration, the optimized PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.02%, and the unencapsulated device retains over 90% of initial PCE at 85 &#176;C, 40% RH for 1200 h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 standard). This innovative assisted solubilization strategy represents a critical step toward improving device stability and accelerating the commercialization of PVSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Industrial&#8208;level Paired Electrosynthesis of Valuable Chemicals over a High&#8208;performance Heterostructural Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paired electrosynthetic technology is of significance to realize the co&#8208;production of high&#8208;added value chemicals. However, exploiting efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of the concurrent electrocatalysis to achieve the industrial&#8208;level performance is still challenging. Herein, an amorphous Co2P@MoOx heterostructure is rationally designed by in&#8208;situ electrodeposition strategy, which is acted as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer realizes a low voltage of 1.30 V, robust stability over 200 h at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, high Faraday efficiencies and yield of NH3 (above 95%, 49.7 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) and formate (above 95%, 152.3 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) at industrial&#8208;level current density of 500 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy studies have shown that high&#8208;valence CoOOH is the main active material of GOR, and the main catalytic conversion pathway of NO2RR involves key *NH2OH reaction intermediates. In addition, theoretical calculations confirm that the Co2P@MoOx heterostructure has strong interfacial electronic interaction and optimized reaction energy barriers, which endows its intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity for the co&#8208;electrosynthesis of NH3 and formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Electrolyte Hydrolysis and Its Impacts on the Interfacial Chemistry of a Li+&#8208;Intercalated Anode during High&#8208;Temperature Calendar Aging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calendar aging occurring during high&#8208;temperature storage has long plagued practical realization of long&#8208;life, high&#8208;safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Generally, the aging process is ascribed to the hydrolysis reaction of fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte salt that generates hydrofluoric acid and chemically corrodes the anode surface. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism about electrolyte degradation, HF generation and surface corrosion remains concealed for various electrolytes. In this work, we employed in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy to resolve the chemical evolution during high&#8208;temperature calendar aging in the bulk of the electrolyte and at the anode/electrolyte interface. Two conventional salts, LiPF6 and Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), were employed for comparison. We identify that the high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis of LiPF6 preferentially occurs when the anion aggregates ([PF6+LiPF6]&#8208;) are attacked by trace H2O. HPO2F2, HF and LiF are generated and assist formation of an inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), improving anode stability against parasitic reactions. The LiFSI&#8208;based electrolyte does not involve hydrolysis, which facilities the formation of an organics&#8208;rich SEI. Nevertheless, the SEI does not passivate the anode surface and could induce severe corrosions via electron tunneling at a high temperature. Our work offers original insights into rational design of electrolyte and interface for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hole Extraction and *OH Alleviation by Pd Nanoparticles on GaN Nanowires in Seawater for Solar&#8208;Driven H2 and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic seawater splitting generates green fuel (H2) and value&#8208;added chemicals (H2O2) using earth&#8208;abundant resources. In this study, Pd nanoparticles are integrated with one&#8208;dimensional gallium nitride nanowires (Pd NPs/GaN NWs) on a silicon wafer to produce H2 and H2O2 from seawater powered by sunlight. In&#8208;situ spectroscopic characterizations combined with computational investigations reveal that in this nanohybrid, Pd NPs function as an efficient hole extractor and *OH alleviator during photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the chloride ions in seawater facilitate the H2O&#8594; H2 + H2O2 conversion by improving the charge dynamics and lowering the energy barrier of the key *OH self&#8208;coupling step over Pd sites in the catalytic system. As a result, the photocatalyst delivers an appreciable hydrogen production rate of 2.5 mmol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (LTH) efficiency of 4.38% in natural seawater under concentrated light irradiation of 3 W&#183;cm&#8208;2 without sacrificial agents and external energies. Notably, water oxidation produces 300 &#181;mol/L [[EQUATION]]H_2O_2H2&#8203;O2&#8203; in 2 hours under 3 W/cm&#178; light, using 20 mL water and achieving 0.53% light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical efficiency. The photocatalyst remain stable for 60 hours with&#160;turnover number of 1.42 x 107 moles H2 per mole of Pd. The Outdoor tests confirm the potential of solar&#8208;driven seawater splitting for green fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Two&#8208;Electron vs. Four&#8208;Electron Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical devices for electrosynthesis, fuel cells (FCs), and metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) requires precisely designing the electronic pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process. Understanding the principle of designing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and stable catalysts helps to reduce the usage of noble metals in ORR. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) emerge as promising alternatives to replace commercial noble metals due to their high utilization of active metal atoms, high intrinsic activity, and controllable coordination environments. In this review, the research tendency and reaction mechanisms in ORR are first summarized. The basic principles concerning the geometric size of the catalysts for both two&#8208;electron ORR (2e ORR) and four&#8208;electron ORR (4e ORR) were then discussed, aiming to outline the material design differences for 2e ORR and 4e ORR. Subsequently, the recent advances concentrated on the ADMCs, including coordination numbers, light heteroatom doping, dual&#8208;metal atoms&#8208;based coordination, and interaction between nanoparticle (NPs)/nanoclusters (NCs) and ADMs are documented. Finally, the key challenges and opportunities in the future design of ADMCs for the ORR are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Engineered Hydrophilic Perovskite Enabling Surface Potential&#8208;Driven Anions Exchange for Multicolor Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difficulty in designing zwitterionic ligands impedes the water&#8208;dispersed CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and their application as fast anion exchange (FAE) probes in biosensing. This study proposes a design paradigm for zwitterionic ligands predicated upon revealing the mechanism of the SN2 reaction between unsaturated alkylamines (Cn') and haloalkanoic acids (HAAs). Among them, the C=C bond can enhance the nucleophilicity of Cn' and promote the electrostatic adsorption of HAAs onto Cn', i.e., the geometric preorganization process, thereby initiating the SN2 reaction. Moreover, an appropriate &#8220;bridge&#8221; length enables HAAs to balance the geometric preorganization process and the Sigma hole intensity of the C&#8208;Br bond. Zwitterionic ligands derived from oleylamine (C18') and 5&#8208;bromovaleric acid (5&#8208;BVA) endow CsPbBr3 NCs with water dispersibility, an almost 100% photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced surface potential, facilitating the capture of halide ions and driving the FAE reaction. Using AgI nanoparticles (NPs) as latent anion exchangers, a third FAE strategy is presented for multicolor biosensing. Such a robust biosensing strategy can generate wavelength shift and chromatic difference for biological target molecules, exemplified by H2S, and is ultimately applicable to multicolor assay in biological, environmental and food samples, demonstrating the immense potential of perovskite&#8208;based FAE probes in biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity, for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8208;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward an optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926 V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686 V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>A ZnO&#8208;based Catalytic System for the Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a wide range of applications as an eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable oxidant. However, the clean, efficient and convenient synthesis of this compound remains challenging. This work demonstrates a rationally designed electron&#8208;self&#8208;supplied catalytic system capable of generating H2O2 from water and atmospheric oxygen without extra energy input. This catalytic system is made of a ZnO coating containing oxygen vacancies and a Zn substrate. The ZnO catalyst layer obtains electrons from the Zn substrate to synthesize H2O2. The H2O2 concentration produced by this catalytic system is up to 17.9 mM without any secondary processing. This remarkably high concentration is attributed to the formation of a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface that promotes the oxygen reduction reaction by accelerating the transfer of oxygen from the ambient air to the catalyst surface. By integrating with atmospheric fog collection, this system can continuously collect H2O2 directly from the air.</dc:description>

         <title>A Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Approach to Isotactic Alternating Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust regio&#8208; and stereoselective ROP approach was developed for the synthesis of isoenriched alt&#8208;PLGA (Regioselectivity up to 97&#8201;%, Pm up to 0.91) from rac&#8208;MG by the exploit of our spiro&#8208;salen scandium complexes, which represents a versatile platform for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability.







Abstract
Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high&#8208;performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl&#8208;glycolide (rac&#8208;MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro&#8208;salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity Pm from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (Tm up to 191&#8201;&#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials.

&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; up to 0.91) from &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-MG by the exploit of our spiro-salen scandium complexes, which represents a versatile platform for the preparation of high-performance biodegradable PLGA materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high-performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio- and stereoselective ring-opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl-glycolide (&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro-salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; up to 191&#8201;&#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio- and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high-performance biodegradable PLGA materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol Aqueous Phase Reforming for Sustainable Polyethylene Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process was developed to convert polyethylene (PE) into n&#8208;alkanes by coupling PE hydrogenolysis with methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR). Utilizing a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, the process achieved 85.1&#8201;% PE conversion and 81.0&#8201;% selectivity toward liquid fuels and lubricant oils, reducing reliance on fossil fuels through eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1&#8201;%) and selectivity (81.0&#8201;%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8722;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0&#8201;% to 88.9&#8201;%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation by Synergistic Incorporation of Pure Silica Silicalite&#8208;1 Zeolite and CeO2 into Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy to active Cu centers by synergistically incorporating S1 and CeO2 into the catalytic matrix. S1 stabilizes small&#8208;sized CeO2 and thus enhances the synergistic interaction between Cu and CeO2. This promotes the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and Cu+ sites at the interface, achieving a simultaneous increase in selectivity and activity.







Abstract
Chemical conversion of CO2 is providing an opportunity to mitigate the global warming induced by the overconsumption of fossil fuel. Cu has been regarded as one of the most powerful contenders in catalyzing CO2 conversion, yet the precise manipulation of its surface state and the nearby chemical environment continues to pose a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst by utilizing CeO2 and pure silicon zeolite (S1) to co&#8208;activate Cu species. In CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (CTM) conversion, the space&#8208;time yield of methanol (STYMeOH) of the obtained CuCe/S1 catalysts reaches 87.23&#8197;g&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a fivefold increase compared to that of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small&#8208;sized CeO2 particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO2. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu+, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Nanocrystals with Aggregate Anionic Structure Enable Ion Transport Decoupling of Chain Segment Movement in Poly(ethylene oxide) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike classical poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes, single ion conductors, and crystalline polymers, this work discovered a novel ion transport mechanism mediated by PEO3: LiBF4 nanocrystals with aggregate anionic structure, which decouples the movement of PEO segments. The ultra&#8208;thin PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte exhibits balanced ion conductivity, Li+ transference number, and mechanical strength, extending the life of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are promising for lithium batteries, but Li+ transport in these electrolytes relies on amorphous chain segment movement, leading to low Li+ mobility and poor mechanical strength. Here we propose a novel Li+ transport mechanism mediated by PEO3:LiBF4 nanocrystals (NCPB) with the aggregate (AGG) anionic structure, which enables a change from amorphous to crystalline phase dominated ion transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte. Experiments and simulations reveal that the interaction between Li+ and F in NCPB with AGG anionic structure simultaneously restricts anion transport and reorients anions within the free volume of NCPB, resulting in a three&#8208;coordination intermediate to facilitate Li+ transport. The unique Li+ transport mechanism through NCPB makes the PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte with a high Li+ transference number (0.73) and remarkably increased mechanical strength (storage modulus &gt;100&#8197;MPa) at 45&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, the Li|LiFePO4 batteries with the ultrathin self&#8208;supported PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit significantly improved cycle life (97&#8201;% @ 468 cycles) compared to those with PEO/LiTFSI electrolyte (failed @ 68 cycles). This work demonstrates a novel ion transport mechanism for achieving selective and rapid Li+ transport.

         <title>Unlocking HFIP for Fluoroalkylation with Molecular Photoelectrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine compounds bearing the hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate fluoroalkylation reagents. Herein we report a molecular photoelectrocatalysis method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent.







Abstract
Despite the increasing interest in radical&#8208;based fluoroalkylation techniques, the organofluorine compounds bearing the partially fluorinated hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate reagents. Herein we report an unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing the readily available hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent. In this process, HFIP is converted into hexafluoroisopropyl radicals, enabling fluoroalkylation reactions. This study broadens the potential applications of molecular photoelectrocatalysis, highlighting its capacity to enable transformations that are difficult to accomplish through traditional electrochemical or photochemical approaches.

         <title>Gradient Design with Low&#8208;Tortuosity Overcoming Kinetic Limitations in High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A multilayer coating with magnetic field alignment is designed to optimize ion transport and concentration gradients in solid&#8208;state cathodes, enhancing electrochemical kinetics and increasing energy/power densities, thereby overcoming a key challenge in solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.







Abstract
The extensive commercialization of practical solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) necessitates the development of high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state cathodes with fast charging capability. However, electrochemical kinetics are severely delayed in thick cathodes due to tortuous ion transport pathways and slow solid&#8208;solid ion diffusion, which limit the achievable capacity of SSBs at high current densities. In this work, we propose a conductivity gradient cathode with low&#8208;tortuosity to enable facile ion transport and counterbalance ion concentration gradient, thereby overcoming the kinetic limitations and achieving fast charging capabilities in thick cathodes. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes deliver a room&#8208;temperature (RT) capacities of 147 and 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and meanwhile achieve a RT areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3&#8197;C, enabling SSBs simultaneously high energy and power densities. The universality of this strategy is demonstrated in LiFePO4 cathodes, providing a novel solution for fast charging and large&#8208;scale application of high&#8208;loading SSBs.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Photosensitizers: Cyanine&#8208;Carborane Salts for Superior Photodynamic Therapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multifaceted assessment of novel cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds exhibit efficient tumor targeting through uptake by organic anion&#8208;transporting polypeptides (OATP). Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, cyanine&#8208;carborane salts generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering apoptosis and significantly suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration. In vivo studies demonstrate anti&#8208;tumor activity with minimal systemic toxicity, highlighting their potential as next&#8208;generation PDT therapeutics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Here, we report the discovery of cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers (PSs) that harness the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing [cyanine+] with the inertness of [carborane&#8722;]. The implementation of [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salts dramatically enhance cancer targeting of the PSs and decrease cytotoxicity. We characterize the cellular uptake of the cyanine&#8208;carborane PSs, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the ability to cogenerate multiple ROS species, suppression of pro&#8208;metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways. We further demonstrate the ability of optimized PSs to eliminate tumors in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. These newly developed [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salt PSs introduce a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer while decreasing side effects.

         <title>The Interplay of Methylidyne and Carbido Species: Modeling a Fundamental Step in the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplest organometallic reaction, the coupling of carbon and hydrogen atoms on a metal surface is demonstrated for the first time in a molecular system. Hydride migration to a &#956;2&#8208;carbido is shown to be favoured over alkyl migration.

         <title>Aluminadichalcogeniranes and Aluminatrichalcogenetanes: Heavier Analogs of Dioxiranes and Trioxetanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and mixed Se/Te aluminatrichalcogenetane have been reported. These species are the first neutral aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, and they serve as powerful synthons for creating unique aluminum heterocycles.







Abstract
Dioxiranes and their heavier chalcogen analogs have long been recognized as pivotal reagents and intermediates in synthetic chemistry, while trioxetanes have largely remained theoretical constructs. In this work, we present the synthesis of neutral, isoelectronic aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, specifically aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and a mixed Se/Te analog of aluminatrichalcogenetane. These compounds, featuring strained AlCh2 and AlCh3 ring (Ch=Se, Te), exhibit significant polarization between the aluminum and chalcogen components. Reactivity studies have revealed that both aluminadiselenirane and aluminaditellurirane show pronounced ambiphilic behavior when interacting with proximal substrates, undergoing facile ring&#8208;opening (cyclo)additions. Additionally, the coordination chemistry of aluminatriselenetane with a Lewis acid has been documented. These investigations not only broaden the repertoire of unique main group species but also provide access to heterocyclic structures that present synthetic challenges through conventional methods.

         <title>Monomer Design Enables Mechanistic Mapping of Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Aromatic Thionolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BINOL&#8208;derived thionolactone exhibits exceptional anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerizability, which helps unravel the mechanistic imbalance between initiation and propagation, leading to first facile preparation of well&#8208;defined aromatic polythioesters. This approach also allows monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer atropisomerism transfer to create optically active polymeric materials with designed topology.







Abstract
Degradable chalcogenide polyesters, e.g., polythioesters (PTEs), typically exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thionolactones, an intrinsically promising yet underexplored approach to accessing PTEs, however, is still limited by: intolerance of metal catalysts, inadequate control over chain growth, and the absence of aromatic system. Monomer design&#8208;boosted mechanistic studies may address the above challenges. Here, we present a new and highly reactive thionolactone synthesized from 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL). Our investigations into polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics have underscored the importance of rapid initiation, eventually leading to the discovery of tetrabutylammonium 2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;thiocarboxylate as a distinctive initiator that enables genuinely controlled and living polymerization of thionolactones. Ultimately, the atropisomerism inherent in BINOL has resulted in the creation of axially chiral PTE materials with tailored molecular weights, enantiomeric compositions, and topologies.

         <title>The Proximal Protonation Source in Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C Single Atom Catalysts Selectively Boosts CO2 to Methane Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise functional group modulation of the coordinating N atom (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) to Cu2+ in a purpose&#8208;designed single atom catalyst with the active center Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C embedded in reduced graphene oxide proves the critical protonation role of the proximal N&#8722;H moiety for CO2 hydrogenation, leading to exceptional electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance.







Abstract
Regulating the coordination environment of active sites has proved powerful for tapping into their catalytic activity and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, yet the heterogeneous nature of copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) makes it challenging. This work reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to construct a SAC (rGO@Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C) by inlaying preformed amine coordinated Cu2+ units into reduced graphene oxide (rGO), permitting molecular level revelation on how the proximal N&#8208;site functional groups (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) impact on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is demonstrated that the N&#8722;H moiety of rGO@Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C can serve as an in situ protonation agent to accelerate the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane reduction kinetics, delivering a methane current density (163&#8197;mA/cm2) 2.42&#8208;times that with the &#8208;CH3 substituted counterpart rGO@Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations elucidate that the high methane faradaic efficiency (77.1&#8201;%) achieved here is enabled by opening up the energetically favorable formyl pathway (*OCHO pathway) against the traditional *CO pathway that normally leads to various CO2RR products other than methane. Our strategy sets the stage to precisely modulate single&#8208;atom catalysts for efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Triazolate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Diluted CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NICS&#8208;24, a novel Zn(II)&#8208;based diaminotriazolate oxalate MOF, exhibits significant improvements in CO2 adsorption at low concentrations compared to compositionally related CALF&#8208;20. In humid conditions, competitive adsorption of water and CO2 occurs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding interactions between the framework and guest molecules, as well as between the guest molecules themselves.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400&#8211;2000&#8197;ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS&#8208;24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn&#8208;oxalate 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate framework with two distinct square&#8208;shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor&#8208;relevant concentrations. NICS&#8208;24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7&#8197;mmol/g at 2&#8197;mbar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn&#8208;oxalate 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate &#8211; CALF&#8208;20 (0.17&#8197;mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino&#8208;functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS&#8208;24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85&#8201;% reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real&#8208;world conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Targeting Macrocyclic Peptides as Nanomolar Inhibitors of Self&#8208; and Cross&#8208;Seeded Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) amyloid self&#8208;assembly by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) has been suggested to link type 2 diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Here we show that designed multi&#8208;targeting macrocyclic peptides previously found to inhibit IAPP and/or Alzheimer's amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;40(42)) are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloid self&#8208;assembly and promising leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs.







Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has recently emerged as a risk factor for PD. Cross&#8208;interactions between their amyloidogenic proteins may act as molecular links. In fact, fibrils of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (T2D) can cross&#8208;seed &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis and &#945;Syn and IAPP colocalize in PD brains. Inhibition of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis could thus interfere with PD pathogenesis. Here we show that macrocyclic peptides, designed to mimic IAPP self&#8208;/cross&#8208;interaction sites and previously found to inhibit amyloidogenesis of IAPP and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide A&#946;40(42), are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;Syn. Anti&#8208;amyloid function is mediated by nanomolar affinity interactions with &#945;Syn via three &#945;Syn regions which are identified as key sites of both &#945;Syn self&#8208;assembly and its cross&#8208;interactions with IAPP. We also show that the peptides block A&#946;42&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;Syn as well. Based on their broad spectrum anti&#8208;amyloid function and additional drug&#8208;like features, these peptides are leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs in PD, T2D, AD, and their comorbidities, while the identified &#945;Syn key segments are valuable targets for novel, multi&#8208;site targeting amyloid inhibitors in PD and related synucleinopathies.

         <title>Synergizing Mg Single Atoms and Ru Nanoclusters for Boosting the Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of efficient catalysts with high H2O molecule activation ability holds great importance for H2 production. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (BNC), was constructed as a high&#8208;performance support for ruthenium (Ru) nano&#8208;clusters. Dual functions of Mg SACs were discovered, where the Mg atoms beneath Ru catalysts built an interfacial electron polarization, inducing electron transfer from Ru to the Mg&#8208;BNC support. In addition, the oxyphilic Mg SACs adjacent to the Ru catalysts could actively participate in H2O adsorption. The combination of experimental characterization, reaction kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated a stronger intrinsic H2O activation capability at the positive Ru sites. Meanwhile, the synergistic Mg SACs jointly contribute to the acceleration of the sluggish H2O dissociation process in ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis reaction, resulting in exceptional hydrogen production activity and catalytic stability, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for utilizing alkaline earth metals as both the electronic promoter and the reactant activator, offering inspiration for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the mechanism of surface cationic vacancy induced high activity of metastable lattice oxygen in Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich cathode materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides exhibit high specific capacity due to the cationic and anionic reaction process during high&#8208;voltage cycling (&#8805; 4.6 V). However, they face challenges such as low initial coulombic efficiency (~70%) and poor cycling stability. Here, we propose a combination of H3BO3 treatment and low temperature calcination to construct a shell with cationic vacancy on the surface of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 (LLNMO). The H3BO3 treatment produces cationic vacancy and lattice distortion, forming an oxidized On&#8208; (0&lt;n&lt;2) on the surface, accompanied by electrons redistribution. Low temperature calcination eliminates lattice distortion, activates metastable On&#8208; and promotes coherent lattice formation. In addition, the cationic vacancy shell reduces the diffusion energy barrier of Li+, allowing more Li+ and oxygen to participate in deeper reactions and increasing the oxidation depth of oxygen. The modified material (LLNMO&#8208;H10&#8208;200) exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of up to 88% and a capacity of 256 mAh g&#8208;1. Moreover, similar enhancements were observed with Co&#8208;containing lithium&#8208;rich materials, with a 280 mAh g&#8208;1 discharge capacity and 89% coulombic efficiency. These findings reveal the correlation between cationic vacancy, metastable oxygen activation and bulk phase activity, offering a novel approach to enhancing the initial coulombic efficiency and cycle stability of Li&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbon Fixation Using Photosynthetic Organelles in Artificial Photosynthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building an artificial photosynthetic cell from scratch&#160;helps to understand&#160;the working mechanisms&#160;of chloroplasts.&#160;It is a challenge to achieve carbon fixation triggered by photosynthetic organelles in an artificial cell. ATP synthase and photosystem II (PSII)&#160;are purified and reconstituted onto the phospholipid membrane to fabricate photosynthetic organelles. With the integration of phycocyanin, the ATP production yield increases by 2.51&#8208;fold due to the enhanced light harvesting capability. The carbon fixation pathway is established by converting &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate with cascade enzyme reactions including the isocitrate&#160;dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO), and ATP citrate lyase (ACL).&#160;The photosynthetic organelles,&#160;phycocyanin,&#160;and carbon fixation pathway are encapsulated&#160;into giant unilamellar vesicles&#160;to obtain artificial photosynthetic cells, which convert &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate inside artificial cells upon light irradiation. The acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate&#160;are&#160;the most important intermediate products in the cellular&#160;metabolic networks for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our results provide a way for efficient light energy conversion to produce ATP and fix CO2, and pave the path to build&#160;autonomous artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cluster&#8208;Cluster Heterostructure Enabling Fast Hydrogen Evolution for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon black has been extensively employed as the support for noble metal catalysts for electrocatalysis applications. However, the nearly catalytic inertness and weak interaction with metal species of carbon black are two major obstacles that hinder the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Herein, we report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. In the case of NiOx cluster&#8208;decorated carbon black, a strongly coupled cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure consisting of Pt clusters and NiOx clusters (Pt&#8208;NiOx/C) is formed and delivers greatly enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The NiOx clusters can not only accelerate the hydrogen evolution process as the co&#8208;catalyst, but also optimize the adsorption of H intermediates on Pt and stabilize the Pt clusters. Notably, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Pt&#8208;NiOx/C as the cathode catalyst (with a loading of only 50 &#956;gPt cm&#8208;2) delivers the most competitive electrochemical performance reported to date, requiring only 1.90&#8201;V to reach a current density of 2 A cm&#8208;2. The results demonstrate the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Targeted Photoactivation of Ion Channels in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of oxidative stress in living cells is essential for maintaining cellular processes and signal transduction. However, developing straightforward strategies to activate oxidative stress&#8208;sensitive membrane channels in situ poses significant challenges. In this study, we presented a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system based on a conjugated oligomer, oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazole (OPV&#8208;Im), designed for the activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) calcium channels in situ by superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8211;) without requiring external light sources. The OPV&#8208;Im oligomer, which targeted the cell membrane efficiently, leading to the activation of TRPM2 channels in situ by CRET process and subsequent intracellular calcium overload. This cascade resulted in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of autophagy, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, this strategy can be applied for the selective killing of tumor cells that overexpress TRPM2 ion channels and for inhibiting the growth of three&#8208;dimensional tumor cell spheroids. Compared to optogenetics and photodynamic therapy, our system offers a novel approach for regulating ion channel activity and oxidative stress in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#8220;Flexible&#8221; Solvent Molecule Enabling High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) exhibit good performance in lithium metal batteries. However, understanding how the intermolecular interactions between solvents and diluents regulate the solvation structure and interfacial layer structure remains limited. Here, we reported an LHCE in which strong hydrogen bonding between diluents and solvents alters the conformation and polarity of &#8220;flexible&#8221; solvent molecules, thereby effectively regulating the solvation structure of Li+ ion and promoting the formation of robust electrode interfaces. The endpoint H of the &#8220;flexible&#8221; chain O&#8208;CH&#8208;CH3 of the 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5&#8208;THF) solvent and the F of the benzotrifluoride (BTF) diluent form strong hydrogen bonds, which expand the bond angle of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule. The expanded bond angle increases the steric hindrance of the 2,5&#8208;THF and decreases its polarity. This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4 Wh kg&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries have garnered significant attention as promising energy storage solutions. However, their performance is often compromised by the risks associated with highly active metallic lithium, unrestricted electrode expansion, and excessive dendrites growth. Here we introduce an advanced lithiophilic anode substrate designed by chemically patterning technology for multiple security enhancements. The innovative lithiophilic array harmonizes spatial Li+ to prepare compact and reversible electrodes. The composite electrodes feature an enhanced C&#8211;F component in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, which protects the deposited lithium metal from unwanted side reactions, thereby stabilizing electrochemical cycling. Notably, the thermal safety can be revealed through the substrate's excellent catalytic ability to convert smoke and toxic gases during extreme thermal runaway. This work demonstrates a novel approach to integrating battery cycling stability with thermal safety, paving the way for more reliable and secure energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous hydrogen production coupled with selective glucose upgradation is achieved on ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowires with tuned Au&#8722;Pt coordination. A low onset potential of ~0.07 VRHE for glucose oxidation is realized on Au3Pt twin nanowires with low loading through facilitated desorption of (C=O) intermediates via a &#8216;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8217; path. An output voltage of 0.24&#8197;V is achieved on the cell with a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Organics electrooxidation coupled hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention due to the low operation voltage. Nevertheless, the spontaneous production of hydrogen coupled with organics valorization remains challenging. Herein, we develop ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowire (NW) catalysts for both electrochemical glucose oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction towards a spontaneous hydrogen production system. The more Pt&#8722;Au coordination and the localized tensile strain generated on twin boundaries of Au3Pt NWs facilitate the selective glucose electro&#8208;oxidation to gluconic acid (GNA) compared to Pt NWs (a low onset potential of 0.07 VRHE and selectivity &gt;90&#8201;%). In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Au3Pt NWs could reduce the energy barriers for GNA generation and alleviate the poisoning of Pt sites via a &#8242;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8242; mechanism, which facilitates the desorption of strongly absorbed gluconolactone. Therefore, the asymmetric cell equipped with Au3Pt NWs catalysts realizes the spontaneous hydrogen production and glucose valorization with a peak power of 50&#8197;mW, which outputs the voltage of 0.24&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The production of 1&#8197;kg H2 of the device is accompanied with $64.2 valorization of the anode product ($1200 ton&#8722;1 for GNA), and 5.36&#8197;kW h of generated electricity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Stepwise Reduction of Aliphatic Carboxylic Esters to Aldehydes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The method described here unlocks the puzzle of the photochemical reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters by sequential SET/HAT processes under the synergistic action of a phenolate&#8208;type photocatalyst and a thiol catalyst. The stepwise reduction of esters to aldehydes and alcohols under mild conditions provides a practical method for fundamental functional group transformation.







Abstract
The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate&#8208;catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl&#8208;type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step&#8208;controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D2O as the deuterium source.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Acetylene Layered Hybrid Perovskites in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based organic spacer cations. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and use them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior performances and enhanced operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptional potential in converting solar energy to electric power in photovoltaics, yet their application is hampered by limited operational stability. This stimulated the development of hybrid layered (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D) halide perovskites based on hydrophobic organic spacers, templating perovskite slabs, as a more stable alternative. However, conventional organic spacer cations are electronically insulating, resulting in charge confinement within the inorganic slabs, thus limiting their functionality. This can be ameliorated by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the spacer cations. We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating for the first time aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based (4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methylammonium (BMAA) and buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylbis(4,1&#8208;phenylene)dimethylammonium (BDAA) spacers, respectively. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and apply them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior device performances with a power conversion efficiency of up to 23&#8201;% and higher operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application.

         <title>W&#8208;Mediated Electron Accumulation in Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W Motifs Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn and W were co&#8208;doped to establish a W&#8208;mediated electron accumulation strategy. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released by sacrificial Zn during the OER process. These electrons are subsequently directed to the Ru site, forming a stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motif and significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;overoxidation performance of the Ru active site







Abstract
The development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology, especially in the pursuit of non&#8208;iridium alternatives. Herein, we report a Zn, W co&#8208;doped Ru3Zn0.85W0.15Ox (RZW) ternary oxide catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 200&#8197;mV and remarkable stability for over 4000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released from the sacrificial Zn species during OER, and subsequently mediated to Ru sites. The observed enhancement in electron density within the stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motifs substantially improves the anti&#8208;overoxidation properties of the Ru active sites. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic metal doping in modulating the electronic structure of OER catalysts during operation, thereby facilitating the development of practical and long&#8208;lasting water electrolysis technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a promising post lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery candidate, manganese metal battery (MMB) is receiving growing research interests because of its high volumetric capacity, low cost, high safety and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the low energy density, mainly constrained by scarce choices and unsatisfying capacity of cathodes, strictly bottlenecks the development of MMBs. In this work, a new class of cathodes based on novel dual&#8208;storage mechanism (DSM) are reported. Working principles of DSM are revealed and deeply understood via ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DSM&#8208;based Cu1.8S cathode, which shows the highest specific capacity of 220 mAh g&#8208;1 and 97.1% higher energy density than previously reported cathodes in storing Mn2+ ions, is presented. The key determinants on DSM and design strategies for next&#8208;generation cathodes are revealed via theoretical calculations. This work provides a new class of high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for MMBs, which is expected to draw inspirations to further enhance the energy density of MMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalysed by Simple Alkali&#8208;Metal Bases in DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple alkali&#8208;metal bases catalyse efficient and selective hydrogen isotope exchange in the presence of the deuterium source dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;d6. Heterocycles, amides, fluoroarenes and other aromatic motifs can be selectively deuterated at room temperature under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies show the crucial role of the metalated solvent, enabling the design of a new set of conditions for less reactive substrates.







Abstract
Dedicated to Proferssor Robert E. Mulvey on the occasion of his 65th birthday.
Isotope Exchange processes are becoming the preferred way to prepare isotopically labelled molecules, avoiding the redesign of multistep synthetic protocols. In the case of deuterium incorporation, the most used strategy has employed transition metals, that offer high reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Despite their success, the trade&#8208;off is that these metals are precious, so expensive, and often exhibit high toxicity. Therefore, alternative transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols would be a welcome addition to this field. In this report we show how the simple bases NaHMDS (HMDS=hexamethyldisilazide) and NaCH2SiMe3 can efficiently and selectively promote deuteration of a wide range of C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in DMSO&#8208;d6, providing an easy and direct access to deuterated compounds. Heterocycles, fluoroarenes, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, amides and other aromatic molecules could be deuterated under mild conditions using catalytic amounts of base. Mechanistic studies along with the isolation and characterisation of reaction intermediates have flagged up the importance of the metalated substrate and metalated solvent in solution, establishing an equilibrium between these compounds is crucial for the success of this approach. An alkali&#8208;metal effect was observed, with heavier alkali&#8208;metal amides being more reactive at room temperature, but their lower stability at higher temperatures made sodium bases the optimal reagents for Hydrogen Isotope Exchange.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3 have been accomplished, in which 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. The intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization was employed to establish the complete cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large&#8208;scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3. Notably, 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. Key transformations include Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling to rapidly assemble the northern fragment, the flow chemistry&#8208;assisted visible light&#8208;induced alkyl radical conjugate addition to convergently construct the southern fragment, and an intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization to establish the cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an efficient synthetic strategy, radical rearrangement reactions demonstrate significant potential in the construction of complex valuable molecules. This Minireview summarizes the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) reactions, providing extensive discussion of the reported examples and highlighting the potential of this area







Abstract
Along with the renaissance of radical chemistry, the past decade has witnessed rapid development in radical&#8208;mediated rearrangement reactions. A wide diversity of radical approaches harnessing functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) have been devised to enhance both synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. However, the application of FGM reactions to construct stereogenic centers remains underexplored owing to the inherent challenges of asymmetric radical reactions. In this Minireview, we summarize the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated FGM reactions. Enantioselectivity can be regulated by chiral substrates, auxiliaries or reagents, or achieved through asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This synthetic strategy demonstrates its superiority in the production of valuable complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.

         <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 catalysts and pure RuO2 catalysts with comparable morphology and crystallinity were synthesized to clarify the effects of chlorine residues on the performance of RuO2. Notably, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability in acidic OER by lowering the limiting potential and suppressing the LOM pathway, maintaining high performance for over 1200&#8197;hours at high current densities.







Abstract
. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a selenium&#8208;substitution strategy, a new selenium&#8208;based ligand, tetraseleno&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ), was synthesized, leading to the construction of a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer (Ag4TSHQ). Ag4TSHQ shares the same topological structure as its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ, but exhibits superior charge mobility of approximately 350&#8197;cm2/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of Ag4TTHQ. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced electrochemical energy storage capabilities. This research underscores the advantages of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) in optoelectronic devices and energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs), a novel class of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron&#8208;rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high&#8208;mobility semiconducting c&#8208;CPs. Despite their potential, c&#8208;CPs incorporating selenium&#8208;substituted ligands remain scarce due to the synthetic challenges associated with both the ligands and the coordination polymers. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraselenol&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer, Ag4TSHQ. Ag4TSHQ exhibits room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6&#8197;S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag4TTHQ (TTHQ=tetrathiol&#8208;hydroxyquinone), enabling precise band gap modulation from 0.6&#8197;eV to 1.5&#8197;eV via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. Time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag4TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag4TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340&#8197;F/g&#8208;significantly outperforming Ag4TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294&#8197;F/g. These findings underscore the potential of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs for optoelectronic applications and energy storage technologies.

     alt="Selenium-Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a selenium-substitution strategy, a new selenium-based ligand, tetraseleno-hydroxyquinone (TSHQ), was synthesized, leading to the construction of a semiconducting three-dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer (Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ). Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ shares the same topological structure as its sulfur counterpart, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ, but exhibits superior charge mobility of approximately 350&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced electrochemical energy storage capabilities. This research underscores the advantages of selenium-ligand-based coordination polymers (c-CPs) in optoelectronic devices and energy storage technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated coordination polymers (c-CPs), a novel class of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron-rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high-mobility semiconducting c-CPs. Despite their potential, c-CPs incorporating selenium-substituted ligands remain scarce due to the synthetic challenges associated with both the ligands and the coordination polymers. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraselenol-hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three-dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ. Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ exhibits room-temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6&#8197;S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ (TTHQ=tetrathiol-hydroxyquinone), enabling precise band gap modulation from 0.6&#8197;eV to 1.5&#8197;eV via a mixed-ligand approach. Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340&#8197;F/g-significantly outperforming Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294&#8197;F/g.

         <title>Robust Mechanically Interlocked Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust mechanically interlocked network ionogel (IGMIN) with improved toughness, high strength, and impact resistance was developed by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Its stable performance as sewable strain sensors for robot gait monitoring highlights its practical potential, offering a new strategy for toughening ionogels and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.







Abstract
Ionogels have attracted considerable attention as versatile materials due to their unique ionic conductivity and thermal stability. However, relatively weak mechanical performance of many existing ionogels has hindered their broader application. Herein, we develop robust, tough, and impact&#8208;resistant mechanically interlocked network ionogels (IGMINs) by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Profiting from the dynamic yet stable nature of the mechanically interlocked networks, IGMINs exhibit high tensile strength (9.6&#8197;MPa), fracture energy (39&#8197;kJ/m2), and toughness (25.9&#8197;MJ/m3), along with a high elongation rate (473&#8201;%) and excellent impact resistance and shape memory, resulting in overall performance that surpasses most reported ionogels. Furthermore, in the application of strain sensors for monitoring the gait of crawling robots, the toughness and robustness of IGMINs ensure their ability to consistently output stable electrical signals during the stretching and contraction processes, thereby highlighting their practical application potential. Our work provides a new research strategy for toughening ionogels and promotes the development of mechanically interlocked materials.

         <title>Disturbance&#8208;Triggered Instant Crystallization Activating Bioinspired Emissive Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Pennatula phosphorea, a new class of smart luminescence gels is constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and aggregated fluorophores in one system. Upon external disturbance such as gentle touch, the composite gels demonstrate Pennatula phosphorea&#8208;like emission including intense fluorescence and long&#8208;lived afterglow resulting from their instant soft&#8208;rigid state transition.







Abstract
Many marine organisms feature sensitive sensory&#8208;perceptual systems to sense the surrounding environment and respond to disturbance with intense bioluminescence. However, it remains a great challenge to develop artificial materials that can sense external disturbance and simultaneously activate intense luminescence, although such materials are attractive for visual sensing and intelligent displays. Herein, we present a new class of bioinspired smart gels constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and fluorophores containing heterogenic atoms. Upon external disturbance, the composite gels undergo an instant and reversible soft&#8208;rigid state transition, simultaneously turning on intense fluorescence and activating ultralong afterglow emission with a maximum lifetime of 877.15&#8197;ms. The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the disturbance&#8208;induced luminescence mainly results from the geometrical confinement of aggregated fluorophores and enhanced molecular interactions to immensely suppress the non&#8208;radiative dissipation. Given their versatile and sensitive disturbance&#8208;responsiveness, dynamic interactive painting and 3D smart optical displays are demonstrated. This study paves a new avenue to achieve disturbance&#8208;sensing soft materials and promotes the development of smart visual sensors and interactive optical displays.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br&#248;nsted Photoacids and Photobases represent a unique class capable of donating or accepting a proton only after excitation.

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases are a unique class of molecules that undergo a major change in their pKa values between their ground and excited states, resulting in donating or accepting a proton, respectively, but only after light excitation. This property of photoacids/photobases makes them an attractive tool for light&#8208;gating various dynamic processes. Here, we review the use of this property to manipulate functional dynamic systems with light. We discuss how a proton transfer event that can happen upon light excitation from a photoacid to a chemical moiety of a certain system or, vice versa, from the system to a photobase, can result in a shift in the equilibrium of the system, resulting in some dynamicity. We detail various systems, including self&#8208;assembly processes of nanostructures, self&#8208;propulsion of droplets, catalysis for hydrogen evolution or CO2 capturing, nanotechnological devices based on enzymatic processes, and changes in proton&#8208;conducting ionophores and materials. We detail the basic guidelines for using Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases in a desired system and conclude with the current technological gaps in further using these molecules.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction of An Integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 Electrode Enabling Efficient Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water or Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface reconstruction of the integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 electrode leads to the formation of Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, which has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and accelerates the catalytic reaction for the hydrogen evolution. It requires only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV of overpotentials to achieve &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and also provides the stable operation at industrial level current densities in alkaline water or seawater.







Abstract
To accelerate the water dissociation in the Volmer step and alleviate the destruction of bubbles to the physical structure of catalysts during the alkaline hydrogen evolution, an integrated electrode of cobalt oxide and cobalt&#8208;molybdenum oxide grown on Ni foam, named CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, is designed. This integrated electrode enhances the catalyst&#8208;substrate interaction confirmed by a micro&#8208;indentation tester, and thus hinders the destruction of the physical structure of catalysts caused by bubbles. Electrochemical testing shows the occurrence of a surface reconstruction of the integrated electrode, and CoO is transformed into Co(OH)2, denoted as Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8. Theoretical calculations determine that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and presents easy hydroxide desorption, which accelerate the catalytic reaction. Electrochemical experiments show that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 exhibits outstanding activity, reaching current density values of &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with overpotentials only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent stability at &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 200&#8197;h. Combined with the previously reported anode, the two&#8208;electrode system also provides the stable operation from 100 to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 600&#8197;h in alkaline solution, and over 200&#8197;h at 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater.

Theoretical calculations determine that Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and presents easy hydroxide desorption, which accelerate the catalytic reaction. Electrochemical experiments show that Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding activity, reaching current density values of &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with overpotentials only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent stability at &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 200&#8197;h. Combined with the previously reported anode, the two-electrode system also provides the stable operation from 100 to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 600&#8197;h in alkaline solution, and over 200&#8197;h at 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline seawater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced G&#8208;Quartets: Robust Supramolecular Polymers Exhibiting Heating&#8208;Induced Aqueous Phase Transitions Into Gel or Precipitate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) forms robust, thermoset, and redox&#8208;responsive G&#8208;quadruplex (G4.Cu+) supramolecular polymers (SPs) through unique metallophilic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic forces. Interestingly, these SPs undergo aqueous phase transitions into a hydrogel via slow dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking below the cloud temperature (Tcp) and fast, complete dehydration into a solid precipitate above Tcp, exhibiting LCST behavior.







Abstract
Certain proteins and synthetic covalent polymers experience aqueous phase transitions, driving functional self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we unveil the ability of supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by G4.Cu+ to undergo heating&#8208;induced unexpected aqueous phase transitions. For the first time, guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) formed a highly stable G&#8208;quartet (G4.Cu+)/G&#8208;quadruplex as a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure with temperature tolerance, distinct from the well&#8208;known G4.K+. The G4.Cu+ self&#8208;assembled in water through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, metallophilic and hydrophobic interactions, forming thermally robust SPs. This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger coordination of Cu+ to four carbonyl oxygens of G&#8208;quartet and the presence of Cu+&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Cu+ attractive metallophilic interactions in Cu+&#8208;induced G&#8208;quadruplex, exhibiting a significantly higher interaction energy than K+ as determined computationally. Remarkably, the aqueous SP solution exhibited heating&#8208;induced phase transitions&#8212;forming a hydrogel through dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking of SPs below cloud temperature (Tcp) and a hydrophobic collapse&#8208;induced solid precipitate above Tcp, showcasing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Notably, this LCST behavior of G4.Cu+ SP originates from biomolecular functionality rather than commonly exploited thermo&#8208;responsive oligoethylene glycols with supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, exploiting the redox reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+, we demonstrated control over the assembly and disassembly of G&#8208;quartets/G&#8208;quadruplex and gelation reversibly.

         <title>Harnessing Adsorbate&#8208;Adsorbate Interaction to Activate C&#8722;N Bond for Exceptional Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents an outstanding photoelectrochemical urea oxidation performance on n&#8208;Si photoanodes, providing a quantitative understanding of adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction for urea oxidation on semiconductor surfaces at a molecular level for the first time.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a promising half&#8208;reaction for green hydrogen production, but the stable resonance structure of the urea molecule results in sluggish kinetics for breaking the C&#8722;N bond. Herein, we realize the record PEC UOR performance on a NiO&#8208;modified n&#8208;Si photoanode (NiO@Ni/n&#8208;Si) by harnessing the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction. We quantificationally unveil a dependence of the UOR activation barrier on the coverage of photogenerated surface high&#8208;valent Ni&#8208;oxo species (NiIV=O) by employing operando PEC spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations. The strong attraction between NiIV=O and adsorbed urea facilitates their N&#8722;O coupling while weakening the C&#8722;N bonding within urea, manifesting as the decreased UOR activation energy from 0.74 to 0.41&#8197;eV when the surface coverage of NiIV=O is enhanced from zero to full, corresponding to more than two orders of magnitude enhancement for the UOR rate. Furthermore, an industrial&#8208;grade photocurrent density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300&#8197;mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction.

         <title>Chemistry as a Catalyst for Transforming the Health and Wealth of South Africa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
South Africa's rich natural resources fuelled its industrialisation but are marred by its colonial past. Despite 30&#8197;years of democracy, deep inequalities remain, with infectious diseases disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. Chemistry and biomedical research can help to address these challenges. This Viewpoint advocates for chemistry&#8208;driven advancements tailored to South Africa's socioeconomic needs to improve healthcare and economic outcomes.







Abstract
South Africa's rich natural resources remain a key driver of its chemical industrialisation but are tainted and constrained by its complex colonial history. Thirty years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, deep sociopolitical inequalities are amplified by an intolerable infectious disease burden amongst disadvantaged communities. In that respect, South Africa shares challenges with many other nations in the Global South; there are limited opportunities for the economic development and growth needed to uplift all strata of society. This Viewpoint examines the role of the chemical sciences in South Africa's unique history and the current state of its academic and industrial sectors, with a focus on the intersection of chemistry, healthcare and biomedical research. We argue that the opportunities offered through chemistry research and development, including local manufacturing, should be exploited and that scientific advancements should be tailored to and integrated with the socioeconomic realities of South Africa for an effective and multidisciplinary approach to improving healthcare outcomes. This Viewpoint aims to inspire a renewed focus on the pivotal role of chemical scientists and their broader societal contributions to combating the country's infectious disease burden and shaping a healthier future for South Africa.

         <title>Photochemical Conversion of Indazoles into Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery relies on preparing diverse libraries of advanced building blocks, often incorporating heteroaromatic motifs. Altering the core of heteroaromatics to maximise library diversity typically requires de novo synthesis of each system. This can be often challenging when specific substitution patterns are needed. Here, we introduce a photochemical strategy for the direct permutation of 1H&#8208; and 2H&#8208;indazoles into benzimidazoles. This transformation exploits the distinct photochemical properties of these heteroaromatics and proceeds under mild conditions. Through systematic experimental and computational studies, we have elucidated a two&#8208;step mechanism involving excited&#8208;state tautomerization of 1H&#8208;indazoles, followed by photochemical rearrangement of the resulting 2H&#8208;isomers. This approach demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and compatibility with a variety of functional groups. This method can expand the structural diversity of heterocycle&#8208;based libraries through the concept of chemical permutation for heteroaromatic interconversion.</dc:description>

This transformation exploits the distinct photochemical properties of these heteroaromatics and proceeds under mild conditions. Through systematic experimental and computational studies, we have elucidated a two-step mechanism involving excited-state tautomerization of 1H-indazoles, followed by photochemical rearrangement of the resulting 2H-isomers. This approach demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and compatibility with a variety of functional groups. This method can expand the structural diversity of heterocycle-based libraries through the concept of chemical permutation for heteroaromatic interconversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In&#8208;situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme&#8208;based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li3N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12% at an extremely high current of 20 mA cm&#8722;2 over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high&#8208;current conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Ganglio&#8208;Oligosaccharides for Probing Ligand Requirements of Glycan Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoglycolipids are an important class of acidic glycosphingolipids implicated in a multitude of biological processes. Little is known about the interactome of sulfated gangliosides, and it is not well understood how a possible interplay between sialylation and sulfation influences molecular recognition. We describe a chemoenzymatic strategy that readily provided a panel of twenty&#8208;one sulfated and sialylated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide that are equipped with the orthogonal protecting groups allyloxycarbonate, levulinate ester and t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl ether. Selective removal of one or more protecting groups followed by sulfation of the resulting alcohol(s) and deprotecting gave several ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. Compound lacking an internal sialic acid could be prepared by exposing several derivatives to a sialidase. Compounds having an unmodified terminal galactoside could enzymatically be sialylated to give hybrid structures, which could be further extended to provide 2,8&#8208;sialosides. The synthetic glycans were printed as a microarray which was used to examine ligand requirements of a series of glycan&#8208;binding proteins including antibodies, toxins, galectins and siglecs. It was found that sulfation regulates protein binding in complex manners and in general sulfation and sialylation of C&#8208;3 of the terminal Gal influences protein binding in different ways.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Accelerated Discovery Coupled with Precise Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of advanced catalysts frequently employs trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods and is lack of highly controlled synthesis, resulting in unsatisfactory development efficiency and performance. Here we propose a data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy to accelerate the development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for efficient water purification. The data&#8208;driven approach enables the rapid screening and prediction of high&#8208;performance SACs from 43 metals&#8208;N4 structures comprising transition and main group metal elements, followed by validation and structural modulation for improved performance through a highly controllable hard&#8208;template method. Impressively, a well&#8208;designed Fe&#8208;SAC with a high loading of Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites (~3.83 wt%) and highly mesoporous structure, exhibits ultra&#8208;high decontamination performance, representing the best Fenton&#8208;like activities for sulfonamide antibiotics to date. Furthermore, the optimized Fe&#8208;SAC shows excellent robust environmental resistance and cyclic stability with almost 100% degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics for 100&#8208;h continuous operation. Theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the energy barrier of intermediate O* formation, the rate&#8208;determining step, resulting in highly selective generation of singlet oxygen. The integration of data&#8208;driven method with precise synthesis strategy provides a novel paradigm for the rapid development of high&#8208;performance catalysts for environmental field as well as other important fields including sustainable energy and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Breaking of Electron Cloud and Space Structure Symmetry Induced Microscopic Split&#8208;phase Interface for High&#8208;rate and Long&#8208;term Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak dipole interactions between highly symmetric H2O molecules and SO42&#8208; species are the root cause of unstable electric double layer (EDL), which triggers the hydrogen evolution reaction and Zn dendrite formation, significantly impeding the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we designed a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface (MSPI) by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to suppress interfacial side reactions and achieve uniform Zn deposition. The structurally asymmetric methylurea (MU) molecules possess both hydrophobic methyl and hydrophilic amino groups, which disrupt the continuity of H&#8208;bonding network and the aggregation state of H2O molecules, resulting in peculiar nanoscale core&#8208;shell&#8208;like clusters. Such a unique structure further evolves into MSPI at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, ensuring a continuously stable EDL. The DRT analysis and MD simulation confirmed that MSPI structure is composed of the outer H2O layer and the inner MU layer, which greatly suppress the activity of H2O molecules and accelerate Zn2+ migration. Consequently, the formulated electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycle reversibility over 1500 h at a high current density of 20 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, achieving a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity of 30 Ah&#183;cm&#8208;2. Additionally, its feasibility was demonstrated by coupling with the I2@AC cathode, achieving an impressive 28,000 cycles at 10 A&#183;g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Allyl Ketones via BINAP&#8208;CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrocupration of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds to generate organometallic nucleophiles has recently become an attractive alternative to conventional stoichiometric reagents in the stereoselective synthesis. Herein, we have developed an efficient and economical method to synthesize enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones via a copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of alkoxyallenes, a significant advancement given the scarcity of reports on such scaffolds in the literature. DFT calculations reveal that this reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of a kinetically favourable Z&#8208;selective allyl&#8208;copper intermediate on acid anhydrides via a six&#8208;membered chair&#8208;like transition state, stabilized by strongly attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions that ultimately leads to high level of enantioselectivities using the simple BINAP ligand. This method successfully overcomes the challenges of over&#8208;reduction of carbonyl functionality in the presence of CuH&#8208;complex, olefin isomerization and the presence of a highly enolizable &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, which can lead to erosion in enantioselectivities, making our strategy highly desirable. The reaction exhibits a wide range of substrate scope including symmetrical as well as carbonic anhydrides with both aromatic, and aliphatic substitutions. In addition, &#945;&#8208;substituted acid anhydrides provide exclusive syn&#8208;selective &#945;,&#945;'&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones in excellent enantiomeric ratios, where the nucleophilic allylation occurs on one of the carbonyls containing the matched &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, confirmed with mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Dispersed Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalyst for Efficient Domino Hydroformylation Reductive Amination of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly dispersed Co&#8722;N/C catalyst has been developed for the efficient hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2. This heterogeneous catalyst enables the synthesis of a broad range of secondary and tertiary amines, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The catalyst shows excellent activity, reusability, and scale&#8208;up potential, offering a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to noble metal catalysts for amine synthesis.







Abstract
The hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2 proceeds efficiently in the presence of a heterogeneous Co&#8722;N/C catalyst with highly dispersed metal centers. Various secondary and tertiary amines can be effectively synthesized from cyclic and linear aliphatic alkenes using this specific material. The active sites of the optimal catalyst result from the synergistic effect of atomically dispersed Co sites with their surrounding N atoms, and the high surface area as well as structural defects of the NC support. The broad applicability (&gt;54 examples), including pharmaceutically relevant molecules, together with the high activity and reusability, underline the general applicability of this catalytic system.

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Tuned Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergistic Covalent Adaptable Networks: Towards Recycled Elastomers with Excellent Creep&#8208;Resistant Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel approach to enhance polyurethane&#8208;urea elastomer performance by manipulating the stereochemistry of rigid diamine chain extenders. The trans configuration (R,R or S,S) of 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane imparts superior creep resistance, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. The elastomers are recyclable via urea bond exchange and retain performance post&#8208;recycling, demonstrating potential for high&#8208;performance, sustainable applications in aerospace and flexible materials.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer innovative solutions for the reprocessing and recycling of thermoset polymers. However, achieving a balance between easy reprocessing and creep resistance remains a challenge. This study focuses on designing and synthesizing polyurethane (PU) materials with tailored properties by manipulating the stereochemistry of diamine chain extenders. By employing cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;configurations of diamine extenders, we developed a series of PU materials with varying mechanical properties and creep resistance. The trans&#8208;configured materials (R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU or S,S&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited superior creep resistance and mechanical strength due to dense hydrogen bonding networks. The cis&#8208;configured materials (Cis&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited enhanced processability and elasticity. Under 0.1&#8197;MPa stress, R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU showed a mere 3.5&#8201;% strain change at 170&#8201;&#176;C over 60&#8197;minutes, highlighting its superior creep resistance. Both configurations can be recycled via urea bond exchange reactions using hot pressing or solvothermal methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the (R,R&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 and (S,S&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segments form six hydrogen bonds with shorter bond lengths, leading to stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Conversely, the (Cis&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segment forms four hydrogen bonds with longer bond lengths, resulting in weaker interactions. This work highlights the critical role of stereochemistry in designing high&#8208;performance, recyclable polymer materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Activation of DNAzyme Nanoassembly for Synergistically Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA nanoassembly with a built&#8208;in RNA walker system was programmed for endogenous miR&#8208;10b&#8208;triggered successive decaging of therapeutic DNAzyme, and the as&#8208;integrated negative feedback loop could counteract the overexpressed TWIST/miR&#8208;10b for abrogated tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
DNAzyme represents a promising gene silencing toolbox yet is obstructed by the poor substrate accessibility in specific cells. Herein, a compact DNA nanoassembly, incorporating multimeric therapeutic DNAzyme, was prepared for selective delivery of gene&#8208;silencing DNAzyme with requisite cofactors and auxiliary chemo&#8208;drugs. By virtue of the sequence&#8208;conservative duplex&#8208;specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR&#8208;10b&#8208;stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR&#8208;10b, thus acquiring the self&#8208;sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR&#8208;10b signaling nodes (self&#8208;adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance issues.

         <title>Transforming Aryl&#8208;Tetrazines into Bioorthogonal Scissors for Systematic Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines are widely used for fast bioorthogonal ligation. However, their application in click&#8208;to&#8208;release chemistry has been impeded by significantly limited release efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduced hydroxyl functionalities to direct and accelerate post&#8208;click tautomerization, resulting in hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines as bioorthogonal tools for highly efficient click&#8208;to&#8208;release of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for precise spatiotemporal control of (bio)molecular function in the biological context. Among these chemistries, the tetrazine&#8208;triggered elimination of cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) stands out due to high reaction rates, versatility, and selectivity. Despite an increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, application of this reaction remains limited by the cumulative performance trade&#8208;offs (i.e., click kinetics, release kinetics, release yield) of existing tools. Efficient release has been restricted to tetrazine scaffolds with comparatively low click reactivity, while highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines give only minimal release. By introducing hydroxyl groups onto phenyl&#8208; and pyridyl&#8208;tetrazine scaffolds, we have developed a new class of &#8216;bioorthogonal scissors&#8217; with unique chemical performance. We demonstrate that hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines achieve near&#8208;quantitative release upon accelerated click reaction with cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes, as exemplified by click&#8208;triggered activation of a caged prodrug, intramitochondrial cleavage of a fluorogenic probe (turn&#8208;on) in live cells, and rapid intracellular bioorthogonal disassembly (turn&#8208;off) of a ligand&#8208;dye conjugate.

An acene with multiple imide functions, 1,4,5,7,8,11,12,14&#8208;pentacene tetraimide (PeTI), is synthesized in three steps by the breaking and mending of naphthalene diimides. Both PeTI and its anionic species PeTI&#8208;CoCp2 display near&#8208;infrared absorption and extraordinary stability. The dealkylated PeTI, named PeTCTI, manifests state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy storage performance in organic potassium ion batteries as an anode.







Abstract
Imide functionalization has been widely proved to be an effective approach to enrich optoelectronic properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, appending multiple imide groups onto linear acenes is still a synthetic challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that by taking advantage of a &#8220;breaking and mending&#8221; strategy, a linear pentacene tetraimides (PeTI) was synthesized through a three&#8208;step sequence started from the naphthalene diimides (NDI). Compared with the parent pentacene, PeTI shows a deeper&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, narrower band gap and better stability. The redox behavior of PeTI was firstly evaluated by generating a stable radical anion specie with the assistance of cobaltocene (CoCp2), and the structure of the electron transfer (ET) complex was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray crystallography. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple redox&#8208;active sites, we are able to show that the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy storage performance of the dealkylated PeTI (designated as PeTCTI) in organic potassium ion batteries (OPIBs) as an anode. Our results shed light on the application of multiple imides functionalized linear acenes, and the reported synthetic strategy provides an effective way to get access to longer nanoribbon imides with fascinating electronic properties.

The Molecular Architecture Laboratory of IIT Madras demonstrates the role of &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP) in the construction of a family of pear&#8208;shaped low&#8208;symmetry double&#8208;cavity coordination cages. Combination of Pd(II) with a pair of isomeric ligands resulted in a low&#8208;hanging fruit i.e. a mixed&#8208;ligated syn&#8208;Pd3La2Lb2 type cage duly supported by orientational compatibility of the ligands. However, use of one type of the ligands resulted in loss of compatibility, yet forming stable though not low&#8208;hanging fruits due to NCP. In their Research Article (e202416332), Dillip K Chand et al. systematically investigate the aforementioned low&#8208;symmetry conjoined&#8208;cages.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H &#945;&#8208;Acetylation: Generation of Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new C(sp3)&#8722;H acetylation methodology for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones that enables the construction of quaternary C centers via copper catalysis. A t&#8208;butoxy radical derived from tBuOOtBu engages in H&#8208;atom abstraction of an C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in substrates R&#8722;H to generate radicals R&#8226; captured by copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ph) formed through acid&#8208;base exchange between [CuII]&#8722;OtBu intermediates and ketones CH3C(O)Ar to give &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;substituted ketones are important chemical targets as synthetic intermediates as well as functionalities in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report the &#945;&#8208;acetylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates R&#8722;H with arylmethyl ketones ArC(O)Me to provide &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones ArC(O)CH2R at RT with tBuOOtBu as oxidant via copper(I) 

&#946;

&#8208;diketiminato catalysts. Proceeding via alkyl radicals R&#8226;, this method enables &#945;&#8208;substitution with bulky substituents without competing elimination that occurs in more traditional alkylation reactions between enolates and alkyl electrophiles. DFT studies suggest the intermediacy of copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ar) that capture alkyl radicals R&#8226; to give R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar outcompeting dimerization of the copper(II) enolate to give the 1,4&#8208;diketone ArC(O)CH2CH2C(O)Ar.

         <title>Designing Zwitterionic Bottlebrush Polymers to Enable Long&#8208;Cycling Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic bottlebrush&#8208;based ionogel polymer electrolytes are rationally designed to enhance Li+ transport with multifunctional capabilities, including dissociating [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters, anchoring anions via cationic groups, and accelerating Li+ migration through anionic groups. The assembled Li metal batteries demonstrate ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 6500&#8197;h and unprecedented cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ionogel polymer electrolyte (IPE), incorporating ionic liquid (IL) within a polymer matrix, presents a promising avenue for safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, sluggish Li+ kinetics, resulting from the formation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters and the occupation of Li+ transport sites by organic cations, limit their practical applications. In this study, we have developed zwitterionic bottlebrush polymers&#8208;based IPE with promoted Li+ conduction by employing poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA) bottlebrushes as matrices of IL. The grafted zwitterionic side chains greatly facilitate the dissociation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters to produce more movable Li+. Moreover, the positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups in zwitterionic side chains effectively restrain anions migration, while the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups immobilize IL cations, preventing them from occupying Li+ hopping sites and reducing the energy barrier for Li+ migration. These synergistic effects contribute to a notable ionic conductivity (7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) of PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE at 25&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE enables ultralong&#8208;term (over 6500&#8197;h) reversible and stable Li plating/stripping in Li||Li symmetric cells. Remarkably, the assembled Li||LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrate unprecedented cycling stability of more than 2000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Sulfonated Hydroxyaryl&#8208;Tetrazines with Increased pKa for Accelerated Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Reactions in Cells</title>

A new generation of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines for cellular click&#8208;to&#8208;release activations is described. These derivatives are easily accessible, stable, and achieve complete release of TCO&#8208;caged molecules within minutes. The introduced sulfo groups provide a versatile handle for modification, equipping the resulting sulfonamides with useful properties. These sulfo&#8208;tetrazines find applications in bioorthogonal prodrug and fluorophore activation.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions that enable switching molecular functions by breaking chemical bonds have gained prominence, with the tetrazine&#8208;mediated cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged compounds (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) being particularly noteworthy for its high versatility, biocompatibility, and fast reaction rates. Despite several recent advances, the development of highly reactive tetrazines enabling quantitative elimination from trans&#8208;cyclooctene linkers remains challenging. In this study, we present the synthesis and application of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines, a class of derivatives featuring phenolic hydroxyl groups with increased acidity constants (pKa). This unique property leads to accelerated elimination and complete release of the caged molecules within minutes. Moreover, the inclusion of sulfonate groups provides a valuable synthetic handle, enabling further derivatization into sulfonamides, modified with diverse substituents. Significantly, we demonstrate the utility of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines in efficiently activating fluorogenic compounds and prodrugs in living cells, offering exciting prospects for their application in bioorthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Direct Air Capture in Industrial Cooling Towers Mediated by Electrochemical CO2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to direct air capture. Widespread industrial cooling towers are demonstrated to be effective for direct CO2 capture from air using a buffered absorbent solution. The captured CO2 can be efficiently released at high purity via electrolysis in a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer operating at room temperature. The system exhibits stable performance over multiple cycles, highlighting its great potential for atmospheric CO2 removal.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change but suffers from low efficiency, small scale, and high cost due to the dilute atmospheric CO2, limited size of air contactors, and heat&#8208;driven CO2 release. Here, we propose combining DAC with widely used industrial cooling towers to extract CO2 from the air and using electrolysis to release the captured CO2 at room temperature. We first prepare a buffered absorbent solution consisting of sodium glycinate, glycine, and sodium chloride for effective CO2 capture from the air, solving the incompatibility problem of the cooling towers with conventional absorbents. Next, we employ a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer for efficient release (&#8805;95&#8201;%) of the captured CO2 with high purity (&#8805;98&#8201;%) by constant current electrolysis at room temperature, bypassing the conventional energy&#8208;intensive heating process. The entire DAC system can operate stably for multiple cycles, and the mechanism for consecutive CO2 capture and release is uncovered. This work reveals the great potential of running DAC in industrial cooling towers coupled with electrochemically&#8208;driven CO2 release, opening up new avenues for curbing the increasingly severe climate change.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis and Applications of Stereogenic &#946;&#8242;&#8208;Methyl Enones and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene enones has been realized with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical and atom&#8208;economic construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl enones that are difficult to access by other methods. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. The synthetic utilities of this methodology have been well demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products, and two spirocyclic diols.







Abstract
The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;&#8208;methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily&#8208;available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone, and two C2&#8208;symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.

         <title>Topological and Morphological Membrane Dynamics in Giant Lipid Vesicles Driven by Monoolein Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoolein cubosomes induce dynamic membrane transformations in giant lipid vesicles. Fusion of cubosomes into the lipid bilayer induces membrane growth and curvature stress. This drives morphological and topological effects such as tubulation, fission, fusion and intraluminal vesicles formation. This work has implications for applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles have important applications as biomedical delivery platforms and broader engineering biology applications in artificial cell technologies. These emerging technologies often require changes in the shape and topology of biological or biomimetic membranes. Here we show that topologically&#8208;active lyotropic liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) can trigger such transformations in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Monoolein (MO) LCNPs, cubosomes with an internal nanostructure of space group

 incorporate into 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DOPC) GUVs creating excess membrane area with stored curvature stress. Using time&#8208;resolved fluorescence confocal and lattice light sheet microscopy, we observe and characterise various life&#8208;like dynamic events in these GUVs, including growth, division, tubulation, membrane budding and fusion. Our results shed new light on the interactions of LCNPs with bilayer lipid membranes, providing insights relevant to how these nanoparticles might interact with cellular membranes during drug delivery and highlighting their potential as minimal triggers of topological transitions in artificial cells.

An operando&#8208;evolved metallic alloy interphase is proposed to achieve all&#8208;round protection for Zn metal anodes. This interphase, consisting of AgxZny alloy and metallic In, synergistically facilitates the migration of zinc ions through the protective layer and induces their planar deposition. Consequently, the Zn@(Ag&#8722;In)||ZnVO full cells demonstrated an excellent capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase, no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense and planar deposition of Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;Cost and Environmental&#8208;Friendly Solar Cells</title>

We for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of semiconductive AgBiS2 NC inks. The solar cells based on these inks realizes efficiency of 9.32&#8201;%, which outperform the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on the complexed ligand&#8208;exchanged methods.







Abstract
Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $&#8197;g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8211;275.2&#8197;$&#8197;g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221; pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.

         <title>A BOIMPY Dye Enables Multi&#8208;Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis: Reaching Super&#8208;Reducing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals of a BOIMPY dianion made the exploration of a catalytic process that relies on consecutive multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer (multi&#8208;PET) possible. Irradiation of the dye molecule leads to an excited species that allows the reduction of strong carbon&#8208;halide bonds and arenes. The synthetic value is showcased by hydrodehalogenations, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;P bond formations, and Birch&#8208;type reductions. Thorough mechanistic investigation is presented.







Abstract
An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con&#8208;PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&gt;2 photons), termed multi&#8208;PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one&#8208;electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super&#8208;reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi&#8208;photon process which is enabled by 390&#8197;nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron&#8208;rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi&#8208;PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi&#8208;PET enabled Birch&#8208;type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.

         <title>Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly from Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets to Spiral, Twisted and Branched Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly is an ideal strategy for synthesizing hierarchical materials, but remains great challenges due to the multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions in the assembly process. Herein a programmable assembly strategy was proposed to customize assembled structure. The assembled structures were transformed from nanosheet structure to spiral, twisted and branched structures by controlling screw dislocation growth and epitaxial growth mechanisms.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials into hierarchical structure is of great interest to fabricate functional materials. However, programmable design of the assembled structures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy to customize the assembled structure. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is designed to orderly transform the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ca ions assembled F127 nanosheets (Ca&#8208;F127 NSs) into spiral nanosheet structures (S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched nanosheet structures (B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched&#8208;spiral nanosheet structures (B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), and twisted&#8208;branched structures (T&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NBs). Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that these different structures maintain the same orthorhombic phase and Ca&#8208;O octahedral coordination structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in the double&#8208;tilt liquid nitrogen cooling holder identifies the Eshelby twist in the twisted structures, demonstrating the spiral structure are formed by screw dislocation growth. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) proves the oriented epitaxial growth in the B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of spiral structure and branched structure can be recombined to form complex hierarchical structures. The epitaxial growth along screw dislocation can lead to the formation of B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs, while the twisted epitaxial growth in the screw dislocation can lead to the formation of T&#8208;Ca F127 NBs.

2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in the N&#8208;doped carbon framework with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and ~100&#8201;% accessibility are synthesized via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy, which deliver a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7&#8197;nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40&#8197;nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42&#8201;%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100&#8201;% accessibility and expedited mass transport.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular hydrogen bonds strategy is first proposed to solve the dissolution issue of small organic cathode materials. This strategy is performed on the TPNQ molecule and is verified to be highly efficient in terms of suppressing dissolution and improving kinetics by redistributing molecular charge and weakening the interaction between the TPNQ molecule and solvents. Li//TPNQ batteries display excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; 88.4&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Stabilizing Hydrogen Radicals in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt&#8208;Copper Mesoporous Nanoplates for Complete Nitrate Reduction Electrocatalysis to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous CoCu nanoplates with confined microenvironment and alloyed composition were precisely designed for complete electrocatalysis of waster nitrate into value&#8208;added ammonia under a natural electrolyte. Thanks to unique physicochemical property, this electrocatalyst performed well with a lower energy consumption in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, which concurrently electrosynthesized ammonia from nitrate at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical reduction of waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) represents an alternative green route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) electrosynthesis in water. Despites some encouraged achievements, sluggish eight electron and nine proton reduction routes that involve multi&#8208;step hydrogenation pathways have severely hindered their NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) and yield rate. Herein, we develop a robust two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous cobalt&#8208;copper (meso&#8208;CoCu) nanoplate electrocatalyst that delivers excellent performance of complete NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR), including superior FENH3 of 98.8&#8201;%, high NH3 yield rate of 3.39&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and energy efficiency of 49.8&#8201;%, and good cycling stability. Mechanism investigations unveil that active hydrogen (*H) radicals produced from water splitting on Co sites spillover to adjacent Cu sites and further stabilize within confined mesopores, which kinetically promote its coupling hydrogenation reactions of nitrogen intermediates and thus facilitate complete NO3RR for favorable NH3 electrosynthesis. Moreover, meso&#8208;CoCu nanoplates perform well as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system that concurrently synthesizes NH3 from NO3&#8722; at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode. This work in stabilizing *H radicals in mesoporous microenvironment provides some insights applied to various hydrogenation reactions for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals in water.

         <title>Regulating Peripheral Nitrogen Dopants in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides atomic insights into the peripheral doping states, which are relevant not only to the thermodynamics but also to the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation reaction occurring at the single&#8208;atom center. The combined theoretical and experimental results show that increasing the nitrogen dopant in farther shells can not only enhance the activity of the Ir1 site but also maintain a high selectivity for propene.







Abstract
For single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the dopants situated near the metal site have demonstrated a significant impact on the catalytic properties. However, the effect of dopants situated further away from the metal centers and their working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, we conduct density functional theory&#8208;driven studies on regulating the peripheral nitrogen dopants in graphene&#8208;based SACs, with a particular focus on Ir1 SAC, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is found that increasing the distance between the N dopant and the Ir1 site results in a different energy change for the reaction process compared to the dense doping models with only first and second&#8208;shell N species. The proposed stochastic doping models demonstrate statistically that increasing the N dopant in farther shells not only enhances the activity of Ir1 but also maintains a high selectivity for propene, which is verified by experimental tests. The modulation of the d&#8208;band center of Ir1 by stochastic N dopants effectively modifies the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby enabling the optimization of the potential energy surface of PDH. These results deepen the understanding of dopant states around metal sites and provide an important implication for the doping engineering in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Structural Bifurcation in the High&#8594;Low&#8208;Spin and Low&#8594;High&#8208;Spin Phase Transitions Explains the Asymmetric Spin&#8208;Crossover in [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;Di{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}isonicotinonitrile)</title>

The title compound exhibits a cooperative spin&#8208;transition with an unusual asymmetric hysteresis. It crystallizes as a mixture of two high&#8208;spin polymorphs HS1 and HS2, which convert simultaneously to the low&#8208;spin phases LS3 and LS4 on cooling. The HS1 and LS3 fractions increase at the expense of HS2 and LS4 upon repeated scanning, which reflects that HS2 converts to a mixture of LS3 and LS4 on cooling, and LS4 to HS1 and HS2 on rewarming.







Abstract
Polycrystalline [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinonitrile) exhibits an abrupt hysteretic spin transition near 240&#8197;K, with a shoulder on the warming branch whose appearance depends on the sample history. The freshly isolated material is a ca 60&#8201;:&#8201;40 mixture of triclinic (HS1) and tetragonal (HS2) high&#8208;spin polymorphs, which are structurally closely related. Both HS1 and HS2 undergo a high&#8594;low&#8208;spin transition on cooling at 230&#177;10&#8197;K. HS1 transforms to a new triclinic low&#8208;spin phase with a doubled unit cell volume (LS3), while HS2 forms a monoclinic low&#8208;spin phase (LS4) with similar unit cell dimensions to HS2. Single crystals of LS3 and LS4 both convert to HS1 on rewarming. The low&#8594;high&#8208;spin transition for LS4 is ca 10&#8197;K higher in temperature than for LS3, explaining the asymmetric thermal hysteresis. Powder diffraction, calorimetry and magnetic data show that multiple cycling about the spin&#8208;transition leads to slow enrichment of the HS1 and LS3 phases at the expense of HS2 and LS4. That is consistent with the HS2/LS4 fraction of the polycrystalline sample undergoing rare, bifurcated HS2&#8594;(LS3+LS4) and LS4&#8594;(HS1+HS2) phase transitions. The rate of enrichment of HS1/LS3 differed between these experiments, implying it is sample and/or measurement&#8208;dependent. Three other salts of this iron(II) complex and the coordination polymer [Ag(&#956;&#8208;L)]BF4 are also briefly described.

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;Perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We determine the speciation in mechanosynthesized formamidinium (FA+) and rubidium (Rb+)&#8208;containing lead&#8208;halide perovskite formulations by NMR. We discover that a secondary non&#8208;perovskite Rb&#8208;based phase incorporates up to 60&#8201;% formamidinium.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3 in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+ or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+ dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+ does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use 1H&#8722;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+ incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5 and &#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the 1H and 87Rb chemical shifts, 1H&#8722;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and 87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60&#8201;% FA+ incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+ into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>Electrolyte Reconfiguration by Cation/Anion Cross&#8208;coordination for Highly Reversible and Facile Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte reconfiguration strategy realizes the cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure to access highly reversible and facile sodium storage by optimizing the interfacial chemistry and de&#8208;solvation process in a broad range of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8211;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6&#8201;%, desirable rate capability under 25&#8201;&#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1&#8197;C under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3&#8201;% and a 15&#8201;% increment of energy density under 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>

We report a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. The resulting crystal&#8208;based robots exhibit motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements.







Abstract
The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivatives with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of controllable motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate one of the critical obstacles towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in non&#8208;aerial environments.

&lt;p&gt;The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water-assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9-anthracene derivatives with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal-based robots capable of controllable motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate one of the critical obstacles towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in non-aerial environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrothermal Stability of Active Sites in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four distinct Cu species co&#8208;exist in Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites under NH3&#8208;SCR conditions: solvated Cu1+ and Cu2+ cations, framework&#8208;coordinated Cu1+ cations, and framework&#8208;coordinated CuIIst species&#8212;formed explicitly during hydrothermal ageing. After hydrothermal treatment, ~28&#8201;% of Cu in Cu&#8208;AEI, while ~46&#8201;% of Cu in Cu&#8208;CHA was converted to inactive CuIIst. The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI is attributed to its tortuous channel structure that hinders the migration of hydrated Cu2+ cations.







Abstract
Combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling shows unequivocally the distribution of active species in fresh and hydrothermally aged Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites during NH3&#8208;assisted selective catalytic reduction of NOx. Four principal species co&#8208;exist: (i) CuI cations coordinated to NH3, (ii) CuI cations coordinated to the zeolite framework, (iii) solvated CuII cations, and (iv) framework&#8208;coordinated CuII species (CuIIst) formed upon hydrothermal ageing of the zeolite sample. The CuIIst species were only observed in the hydrothermally aged zeolite samples and are formed upon the interaction of hydrated CuII cations with extra&#8208;framework Al (EFAl) generated during the hydrothermal treatment. These sites are inactive for NOx reduction, leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the hydrothermally aged zeolites. CuIIst formation was higher in Cu&#8208;CHA (~46&#8201;%) than in Cu&#8208;AEI (~28&#8201;%). The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI framework is attributed to the tortuous channel structure of AEI that hinders the migration of hydrated CuII cations during hydrothermal ageing.

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity increase mechanism in rechargeable magnesium batteries featuring Cu metal is investigated through multiscale joint operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray characterizations. These analyses unveil that the capacity enhancement stems from the progressive electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu. This corrosion initiates irreversible depletion of both the Cu current collector and magnesium metal, ultimately resulting in cell failure.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly (ISA) approach, where organic monomers are synthesized and simultaneously assembled into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks under consistent solvent conditions, resulting in the successful creation of a series of isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with tunable pore sizes and microenvironment.







Abstract
Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.

         <title>Imidazolate&#8208;Stabilized Cu(III): Dioxygen to Oxides at Type 3 Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Type 3 (coupled binuclear) copper systems reduce dioxygen for transport, substrate oxygenation, and electron transfer across aerobic life. Using synthetic models with protic histidine environments, we find that the histidine&#8208;stabilized copper centers become not just one&#8208;electron but also two&#8208;electron shuttles&#8212;they isomerize to copper(III) when deprotonated by a base.







Abstract
Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to an oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes ligated exclusively by monodentate imidazoles, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate&#8208;ligated bis(&#956;2&#8208;oxido)dicopper(III) species. Formal two&#8208;electron oxidation to Cu(III) remains biologically unprecedented, yet is effected readily by addition of base. Spectrophotometric titrations by UV/Visible/near&#8208;IR and copper K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies are interpreted most simply as two cooperative, 2H+ transformations in which the peroxide O&#8722;O is cleaved in the first step. Elaboration from simple imidazoles to a protected histidine extends this isomerization into an amino acid environment. The role of phenolate as a base suggests this four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 is energetically viable in a biological context and requires only two copper centers, which act as two&#8208;electron shuttles when imidazole deprotonation assists. This existential precedent of viable imidazolate intermediates invites speculation into an alternative mechanism for phenol hydroxylation not previously considered at Type 3 copper sites such as tyrosinases. Structural biological evidence suggests imidazolate ligation of copper may be more widespread than generally understood.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins, yet the role of the imidazol&lt;i&gt;ate&lt;/i&gt; conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to an oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes ligated exclusively by monodentate imidazoles, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazol&lt;i&gt;ate&lt;/i&gt;-ligated bis(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-oxido)dicopper(III) species. Formal two-electron oxidation to Cu(III) remains biologically unprecedented, yet is effected readily by addition of base. Spectrophotometric titrations by UV/Visible/near-IR and copper K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies are interpreted most simply as two cooperative, 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transformations in which the peroxide O&#8722;O is cleaved in the first step. Elaboration from simple imidazoles to a protected histidine extends this isomerization into an amino acid environment. The role of phenolate as a base suggests this four-electron reduction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is energetically viable in a biological context and requires only two copper centers, which act as two-electron shuttles when imidazole deprotonation assists. This existential precedent of viable imidazol&lt;i&gt;ate&lt;/i&gt; intermediates invites speculation into an alternative mechanism for phenol hydroxylation not previously considered at Type 3 copper sites such as tyrosinases. Structural biological evidence suggests imidazolate ligation of copper may be more widespread than generally understood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic strategy is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV.







Abstract
Constructing catalysts that simultaneously contain single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and addressed the superiority of hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric nitrogen&#8208;oxidized Tr&#246;ger's base macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. These rigid, electron&#8208;deficient cavities exhibit excellent chiral discrimination for a wide range of guests, achieving a record&#8208;breaking enantioselectivity of 41.







Abstract
Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8722;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.

         <title>A New Class of Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx for Solid&#8208;state Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries are gaining traction due to the high abundance and lower cost compared to lithium, along with the safety advantages of solid&#8208;state batteries. A new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx, synthesized with both Nb2O5 and NbCl3O via a simple mechanochemical reaction is presented. NaNbCl4O exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl4O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx are identified with 23Na and 93Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl4O electrolyte and the cobalt&#8208; and nickel&#8208;free layered Na0.70Fe0.3Mn0.65Al0.05O2 cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with good cycle life at ambient temperature.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Framework&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based spherical nucleic acid (tDF&#8208;SNA) with a dynamic, spiky interface is developed to improve siRNA delivery efficiency. This system largely enhances siRNA duplex efficiency, promotes cellular uptake, and facilitates cytoplasmic access. Consequently, tDF&#8208;SNA effectively delivers siRNA into the cytoplasm, leading to increased gene silencing efficacy.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.

Meanwhile, tDF-SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin-independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF-SNAs is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2-fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Manganese Bromides for Photoluminescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides exhibit switchable thermal quenching (TQ) and anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) behaviors, which strongly depend on excitation wavelength. For example, TQ behavior can be observed when they are excited at the peak and shoulders (direct excitation) of photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum while they exhibit undoubtedly anti&#8208;TQ behavior when excited at the valley (indirect excitation) of PLE or under X&#8208;ray irradiation from room temperature to ~400&#8197;K. These phenomena are proven to originate from the relative change of shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance and efficient Mn&#8208;ligand distance, which regulates the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates.







Abstract
One of the most significant challenges of luminescent materials is the thermal quenching (TQ) at high temperature. Understanding the correlation between crystal structure variation and photoluminescence (PL) quenching is significant to achieve anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) phosphors. Herein, we unveil a universal principle governing switchable TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides. We observed an abnormal anti&#8208;TQ phenomenon when phosphor is excited in the valley of PL excitation (PLE) spectrum (indirect excitation) while TQ phenomenon is observed when excited in the peak and shoulder positions of PLE. Our findings demonstrate that PL intensity is influenced by two variable parameters: the effective Mn&#8208;ligand distance and the shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance. These excitation&#8208;dependent TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors originate from the relative changes in these distances, which modulate the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, as evidenced at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation. X&#8208;ray activated radioluminescence (RL) also exhibits anti&#8208;TQ behavior, which is analogous to the indirect excitation of PL evolution when excited at PLE valley. These insights bridge the gap between PL and RL properties in 0D manganese halides and offer potential avenues for developing advanced anti&#8208;TQ phosphors, efficient LEDs, and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;Induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibited enhanced kidney accumulation in a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury mouse model. By distinguishing the injury stages of necrotic proximal tubules (PTs) through histopathological characteristics, we found that the enhanced kidney accumulation was due to selective retention of the AuNPs in the extracellular lumen of late&#8208;stage necrotic PTs as a result of lumen obstruction by cell debris.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the unobstructed lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.

         <title>Bifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Synergistically Enhances Radiotherapy and Activates STING for Potent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MOF/MSA&#8208;2, leverages high&#8208;Z Hf6 secondary building units for radioenhancement and releases MSA&#8208;2 for sustained STING activation to mediate the regression of colon tumors in mice. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.







Abstract
The activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein by cyclic dinucleotide metabolites plays a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, synthetic STING agonists like 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;dimethoxybenzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoic acid (MSA&#8208;2) exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetics and fail to sustain STING activation in tumors for effective antitumor responses. Here, we report the design of MOF/MSA&#8208;2, a bifunctional MSA&#8208;2 conjugated nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and hexakis(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene bridging ligands, for potent cancer radio&#8208;immunotherapy. By leveraging the high&#8208;Z properties of the Hf6 SBUs, the MOF enhances the therapeutic effect of X&#8208;ray radiation and elicits potent immune stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 further enhances radiotherapeutic effects of X&#8208;rays by enabling sustained STING activation and promoting the infiltration and activation of immune cells in the tumors. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 plus low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation elicits strong STING activation and potent tumor regression, and when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective separators are prepared by spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator. The high electronegativity and strong lithiophilicity of these phenolic compounds ensure superior ion&#8208;selectivity, effectively repelling soluble intermediate anions while facilitating rapid Li ion transport. Thus, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries display superior cycling stability and rate performance under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67&#8201;% for Li2S4, 0.19&#8201;% for Li2S6 and 0.10&#8201;% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and a 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion&#8208;selective separators in energy storage systems.

Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion-selective separators in energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Microdomain Consistency in Polymer Electrolytes towards Sustainable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer electrolyte with hyperdispersed MOF fillers is strategically designed for tackling the chronic issue of uneven mechanical/ionic/electric field distribution, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. The enhanced microdomain consistency of the electrolyte facilitate fast and homogenized Li flux, which results in smooth and stabilized Li growth.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes incorporated with fillers possess immense potential for constructing the fast and selective Li+ conduction. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of the fillers usually deteriorates the microdomain consistency of the electrolytes, resulting in uneven Li+ flux, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we formulate a solution&#8208;process chemistry to in situ construct gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with well&#8208;dispersed metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to a uniform microdomain structure. Through the integration of X&#8208;ray computed tomography analyses and theoretical simulations, our research identifies that the improvement of microdomain consistency in GPEs is beneficial for enhancing its mechanical strength, homogenizing ionic/electronic field distribution and upgrading the interface stability with the elctrodes. Moreover, consistently spread MOFs bind effectively with Lewis&#8208;base anions of Li salts, enhancing Li+ kinetics. Owing to these advantages, the developed GPEs achieve a high conductivity of 1.51&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ transference number of 0.66, resulting in exceptional cyclability of lithium metal electrodes (over 1800&#8197;hours). Additionally, the solid&#8208;state NCM811//Li pouch batteries exhibit an impressive capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles with an N/P ratio of 1.69. This study emphasizes the significant impact of microdomain structural chemistry on the advancement of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reaction cycles applied to &#960;&#8208;conjugated superstructures enable the formation of transient hydrogels whose electrical conductivity is encoded by the consumption of chemical fuels.







Abstract
Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI&#8208;derived fibers, a dual&#8208;component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid&#8208;state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycle using cryo&#8208;EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox&#8208;active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours. These far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium materials are potential candidates in applications such as programmable biorobotics and chemical computing.

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;molecular additive screening strategy for ZnSO4 electrolyte is featured by H&#8208;bond re&#8208;organization and carrier transport hindrance at the electrode interface, thereby decreasing water activity and homogenizing Zn deposition toward durable Zn batteries.







Abstract
In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Maleimide&#8208;Based Dual Functionalization of Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleimides can target the N&#8208;termini of proteins instead of cysteine by the use of 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde and copper(II) salt under non&#8208;denaturing conditions. The methodology requires no mutagenesis of proteins and enables the high&#8208;yield attachment of various functional groups to proteins with various N&#8208;terminal amino acids through a simple operation using commercially available maleimides.







Abstract
Maleimide derivatives are privileged reagents for chemically modifying proteins through the Michael addition reaction with cysteine due to their selectivity, operational simplicity, and commercial availability. However, since accessible free cysteine is rarely found in natural proteins, it is highly desirable to find alternative targets to enable direct bioconjugation of proteins with maleimides. In this study, we have developed an operationally simple and straightforward method for the N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins without the need for mutagenesis via a copper(II)&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides and 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PCA) derivatives under non&#8208;denaturing conditions at pH&#8197;6 and 37&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous media. Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross&#8208;linked at the N&#8208;termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well&#8208;defined structures in a wide range of research fields.

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional kirigami mechanics of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) in the solid state are demonstrated through mechanical and molecular stimuli. By controlling these external stimuli, the molecular framework of the ZIF undergoes significant changes, with up to a 37&#8201;% alteration in unit&#8208;cell parameters. This unique folding behavior also leads to programmable pore structures in this channel&#8208;type ZIF, functioning similarly to check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifolds to regulate fluid flow.







Abstract
Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Allylic Nitriles via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Cyanation of Biaryl Diallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitriles in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks.







Abstract
Axially chiral nitriles are common motifs in organic photoelectric materials, biological compounds, and agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the limited synthetic approaches to axially chiral nitriles have impeded their availability. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitrile structures in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that both steric and electronic interactions play crucial roles in determining the enantioselectivity of this transformation. Moreover, this mild and facile protocol is also applicable for gram&#8208;scale preparation of the chiral nitriles.

         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binder&#8208;free MOF polycrystalline membrane based on HKUST&#8208;1 was constructed on the surface of Cu foil by epitaxial growth strategy. During the initial Li+ deposition process, Li+ ions will combine with HKUST&#8208;1 to form a Li&#8208;rich HKUST&#8208;1 membrane. This behaviour substantially reduces overpotential, improves the quality of deposited Li, inhibits dendrite growth and ensures the long&#8208;term stable cycling of battery.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1&#8197;M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9&#8201;% after 1100 cycles.

         <title>Stabilization of the Compressed Planar Benzene Dianion in Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Rare Earth Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

The first inverse sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;C6H6) with RE = trivalent yttrium, dysprosium, and erbium, are presented, which exhibit a completely planar antiaromatic benzene bridging dianion ligand. The remarkable planarity of the bridging parent benzene dianion is otherwise unknown with any s&#8208;, p&#8208;, d&#8208;, or 4f&#8208; metal, and rationalized by the match of the metals d&#8208;manifold with the &#960;*&#8208;molecular orbital of the bridging benzene unit and strong electrostatically compression through coordination with the two cationic REIII sites.







Abstract
For the first time, the capture of the planar antiaromatic parent benzene dianion in between two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations (REIII), each stabilized by two guanidinate ligands, is reported. The synthesized inverse&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;C6H6), (RE=Y (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)) were crystallized from aprotic solvents and feature a remarkably planar parent benzene dianion, previously not encountered for any metal ion prone to low or absent covalency. The &#8722;2 charge localization at the benzene ligand was deduced from the results obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopy, magnetometry, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the diamagnetic Y complex 1, the equivalent proton resonance of the bridging benzene dianion ligand is drastically shifted to higher field in comparison to free benzene. This and the calculated highly positive Nucleus&#8208;Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values are attributed to the antiaromatic character of the benzene dianion ligand. The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;&#8208;type orbitals of the d&#8208;manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two REIII sites.

The antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain could effectively suppress the energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, resulting in a low nonradiative transition rate and a high photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Photoexcited energy migration is prone to causing luminescence quenching in Mn2+ luminescent materials, presenting a formidable challenge for optoelectronic applications. Although various strategies and mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the role of spin alignment between adjacent Mn2+ ions has remained largely unexamined. In this study, we have elucidated the influence of spin alignment on energy migration within the one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+&#8208;metal halide compound (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) through variable&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic&#8208;optical spectroscopy. This investigation was conducted with reference to (CH6N3)2MnCl4 (GUA) with isolated [Mn3Cl12]6&#8722; trimers and Cd2+&#8208;doped TMMC. The spin order in TMMC below approximately 55&#8197;K is demonstrated by the disorder&#8208;order transition observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility. This finding is further corroborated by the negligible shift in the temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent emission peaks, a consequence of magnetic saturation. Our results indicate that the antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain in TMMC effectively suppresses energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, thereby reducing nonradiative transitions and enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). This research casts new light on the potential for developing high&#8208;performance Mn2+&#8208;doped phosphors for optoelectronic and spin&#8208;photonic applications, offering insights into the manipulation of spin and energy dynamics in these materials.

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

By delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints, the central brominated acceptor of CH&#8722;B afforded the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.78&#8201;% for binary organic solar cells, also achieved the best performance when further increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Given homomorphic fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and locations on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8722;F, CH&#8722;C and CH&#8722;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8722;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8722;B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH&#8722;B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78&#8201;%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35&#8201;% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record&#8208;breaking OSCs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Defined Stem&#8208;Loop Structure Library for the Discovery of L&#8208;RNA Aptamers that Target RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine mirror&#8208;image SELEX with a pre&#8208;structured library for the first time, using a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure library to develop the G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform. G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq can serve as a general L&#8208;RNA aptamer SELEX platform for RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) targets. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 for the EBNA1 rG4 is selected in three rounds (within a week). It can effectively inhibit EBNA1 mRNA translation in Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;positive cancer cells.







Abstract
L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been developed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and regulate G4&#8208;mediated gene expression. However, the aptamer selection process is laborious and challenging, and aptamer identification is subject to high failure rates. By analyzing the previously reported G4&#8208;binding L&#8208;RNA aptamers, we found that the stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure is favored by G4 binding. Herein, we present a robust and effective G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform specifically for G4 targets by introducing a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop structure library during the SELEX process. Using G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq, we identified an L&#8208;RNA aptamer, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12, for the Epstein&#8211;Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) RNA G4 (rG4) in just three selection rounds. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 maintained the stem&#8208;loop structure initially introduced, and possessed a unique G&#8208;triplex motif that is important for the strong binding affinity and specificity to EBNA1 rG4. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 effectively downregulated endogenous EBNA1 protein expression in human cancer cells and showed selective toxicity towards Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;positive cancer cells, highlighting its potential for targeted therapy against EBV&#8208;associated cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness and generality of G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq by selecting L&#8208;RNA aptamers for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) rG4 and the hepatitis C virus subtype 1a (HCV&#8208;1a) rG4, obtaining high&#8208;affinity aptamers in three selection rounds. These findings demonstrated G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq as a robust and efficient platform for the selection of rG4&#8208;targeting L&#8208;RNA aptamers.

         <title>Electrothermal Conversion of Methane to Methanol at Room Temperature with Phosphotungstic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an electro&#8208;thermal process, methane is aerobically oxidized to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. This system does not require the noble metals or hazardous reaction mixtures. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at room temperature.







Abstract
Traditional methods for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol frequently require the use of noble metal catalysts or flammable H2&#8208;O2 mixtures. While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45

 with approximately 20.3&#8201;% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90

 ${\mu mol\ {g}_{PTA}^{-1}{h}^{-1}}$



 catalytic activity, over 74.3&#8201;% methanol selectivity, and 10&#8197;hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the surface energy state of the SnO2 buried interface was modulated by proton precompensation treatment, which can inhibit the proton transfer behavior guided by proton affinity and enhance the stability of perovskite crystal, achieving efficient perovskite solar cells with significantly improved photothermal stability.







Abstract
The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90&#8201;% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000&#8197;h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55&#8201;% than the control devices (23.03&#8201;%).

         <title>Corannulene&#8208;Based Quintuple [6]/[7]Helicenes: Well&#8208;Preserved Bowl Core, Inhibited Bowl Inversion and Supramolecular Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quintuple [6]helicenes with Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers, along with [7]helicene Q[7]H, were synthesized by directly hybridizing corannulene and quintuple helicene. Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, enabling it to recognize fullerenes. Furthermore, the subtle conformational variations of Q[6]H lead to significant changes in its chiral stability and bowl inversions.







Abstract
Herein, corannulene&#8208;based quintuple [6]helicenes (Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2) and [7]helicene (Q[7]H) were synthesized via penta&#8208;fold Heck and Mallory reaction. Notably, Q[7]H represents the highest reported helicene based on corannulene. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, while Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[7]H exhibit quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformations. Upon heating, conformer Q[6]H&#8208;1 undergoes conversion to the thermodynamically more stable conformer Q[6]H&#8208;2, whereas conformer Q[7]H remains unchanged due to larger steric congestion. Racemization of the enantiomer of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and conformational conversion were observed simultaneously at elevated temperature, with DFT studies indicating a racemization barrier of 32.06&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In contrast, the racemization barrier for Q[6]H&#8208;2 was calculated to be 45.46&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, indicating exceptional chiral stability. Surprisingly, the bowl inversions of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers are somewhat inhibited by the helical blades, whereas this was not observed for other possible conformers of Q[6]H. These results first demonstrated that subtle conformational variations can lead to significant changes in chiral stability and bowl inversions of multiple helicenes. Due to the well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, propeller&#8208;shaped conformation and electron complementarity, Q[6]H&#8208;2 can recognize fullerenes in both solution and solid state, which is a rare instance of co&#8208;crystallization assembly between multiple helicenes and fullerenes.

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics of targeted protein degraders at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across 25 targets. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and the synthesis of a minimal number of kinetic scouting analogues can accelerate degrader development.







Abstract
Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.

         <title>Unveiling Surface Reconstruction as the Primary Trigger for Capacity Loss in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and structural degradation of ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with different structures was systematically studied. contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction (i.e., chemical decay) triggers rapid capacity decay.







Abstract
Mechanical failures, such as cracks and nanopores, along with the associated surface reconstruction, have long been regarded as the primary causes of capacity decay in ultra&#8208;high Ni layered oxides. However, the impact of these failures on performance degradation has not yet been effectively elucidate and distinguished. Herein, we develop ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo&#8208;mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.

         <title>Selective Nonenzymatic Formation of Biologically Common RNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

Template&#8208;free RNA loop&#8208;closing ligation selectively generates RNA tetraloops that are prevalent in biology, as demonstrated by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Utilizing high&#8208;yield overhang sequences enables the efficient assembly of functional RNAs.







Abstract
The prebiotic formation of RNA building blocks is well&#8208;supported experimentally, yet the emergence of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;specific RNA oligomers is generally attributed to biological selection via Darwinian evolution rather than prebiotic chemical selectivity. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate the partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products by either splinted ligation or loop&#8208;closing ligation. Comprehensive sequence&#8208;reactivity profiles revealed that loop&#8208;closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (where N represents A, C, G, or U) under competing conditions. In contrast, splinted ligation products tended to be GC rich. Notably, the overhang sequences that preferentially partition to loop&#8208;closing ligation significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops, whereas the overhangs favoring splinted ligation exhibit an inverse correlation with biological tetraloops. Applying these sequence rules enables the high&#8208;efficiency assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs without template inhibition. Our findings suggest that the RNA tetraloop structures that are common in biology may have been predisposed and prevalent in the prebiotic pool of RNAs, prior to the advent of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that the one&#8208;step prebiotic chemical process of loop&#8208;closing ligation could have favored the emergence of the first RNA functions.

         <title>Novel Inorganic&#8208;Organic Dual&#8208;Photosensitizing Dinuclear&#8208;Metal Self&#8208;Assembly System for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis without Sacrificial Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

We employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct a novel inorganic&#8208;organic dual&#8208;photosensitizing dinuclear metal molecular catalyst, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. In photocatalytic reactions, this self&#8208;assembly hybrid not only optimized the charge transfer between inorganic PS and molecular catalysts, but also boosted the development of artificial photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.







Abstract
Owing to the unique synergistic effect, dinuclear&#8208;metal&#8208;molecule&#8208;catalysts (DMCs) show excellent performance in catalytic fields. However, for overall photocatalytic CO2 reaction (CO2RR), it is still a challenge to construct well&#8208;matched photosensitizer (PS) components for DMCs&#8208;based photocatalysts. Inorganic&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot PS possesses capacities of multiple exciton generation and catalyzing water oxidation but is incompatible with DMCs. In contrast, organic PS can be covalently linked with DMCs but inescapable of using sacrificial electron donors. For overall photocatalytic CO2RR, organic&#8211;inorganic dual&#8208;photosensitizing system might be a promising candidate. Herein, we employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;sensitized Co2L DMCs (Py&#8208;Co2L) and perovskite (PVK) quantum dots, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. Using H2O as an electron donor, PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L] realized 105.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 CO yield in photocatalytic CO2RR, much higher than PVK (15.44&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) and PVK@Co2L (32.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), ascribing to the efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer. The experimental results and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the pyrene linked on Co2L boosted the electron delivery from PVK to DMCs. Besides, this strategy could also be extended to the photocatalytic H2 evolution coupled with alcohol oxidation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work lightens the integration of DMCs, organic and inorganic PS components, promoting the development of photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) is designed with a 3D Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) cage&#8208;like ligand to accommodate atomically dispersed nickel centers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. It achieves a CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity under visible light irradiation. The homogeneous nature of this co&#8208;catalyst enables efficient charge transfer from photosensitizer to the Ni2+ active site, reducing nearby CO2 molecules enriched by the unique CB[7] cage.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9&#8201;% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Nickel Dynamics Switches the Selectivity of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface dynamics is the key to explain the product distribution of CO2 hydrogenation on Ni. Density Functional Theory combined with microkinetic simulations shows that high CO coverage induces Ni adatoms, promoting methanation. At higher temperatures, fewer adatoms increase CO selectivity. This study highlights how reaction intermediates dynamically affect catalytic behavior, offering insights into material behavior under real conditions.

CO+H2O) allows to balance syn&#8208;gas under industrial conditions. Nickel has been suggested as a potential catalyst but the temperature required is too high, more than 800&#8201;&#176;C, limiting practical implementation but when lowering the temperature methanation occurs. Simulations via Density Functional Theory on well&#8208;defined surfaces have systematically failed to reproduce these experimental results. But under reaction conditions, Ni surfaces are not static and DFT models coupled to microkinetics show that low temperatures (high CO coverages) drive the generation of Ni adatoms that are the active sites for methanation. At higher temperatures, the adatom population decreases, and the selectivity towards CO increases. Thus the mechanism behind the selectivity switch is driven by the dynamics induced by reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the inclusion of dynamic aspects of materials under reaction conditions in the understanding of complex catalytic behaviour.

This study presents an innovative electrolyte formulation for rechargeable magnesium batteries, addressing the challenges of complex synthesis and magnesium anode passivation seen in traditional boron&#8208;based salts. By combining tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), the system evolves into Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 upon contact with the Mg anode. This results in a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enhancing Mg plating and stripping efficiency. Our proposed synthetic reaction and in situ formation of SEI later also has universality for other B(OR)3, where R represents different F substitution. This formulation exhibits superior electrochemical performance, low overpotential, and long cycling life, outperforming previous boron&#8208;based electrolytes.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based organic magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF=fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability and oxidative stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg metal anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent, which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80&#8197;mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500&#8197;h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Chevrel&#8208;phase Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes, with the overarching goal of establishing favorable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases that are pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.

         <title>Unconventional Near&#8208;Equilibrium Nucleation of Graphene on Si&#8208;Terminated SiC(0001) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface is elucidated. The stable carbon clusters, preferential nucleation sites and nucleation pathways are revealed, and a nucleation diagram is established. Contradictory experimental observations on graphene growth on SiC(0001) surface are explained. Nucleation on terraces instead of near step edges is proposed to be crucial for producing high&#8208;quality graphene on SiC(0001) surface.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si semiconductor technologies for directly fabricating high&#8208;end electronics. Although significant progress has been achieved in epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC recently, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a theoretical study to elucidate graphene near&#8208;equilibrium nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface. It is found that the ultra&#8208;large lattice mismatch between SiC(0001) surface and graphene and the highly localized electron distribution on SiC(0001) surface lead to a distinctive nucleation process: (i)&#8197;Most of the magic carbon clusters on SiC(0001) show only C1 symmetry and are mainly composed of pentagonal rings; (ii)&#8197;Two possible nucleation pathways are revealed, i.e., longitudinal and circular modes; (iii)&#8197;Carbon clusters are more stable on flat terraces than near atomic step edges. Based on above findings, a graphene nucleation diagram on SiC(0001) is established and experimentally observed contradictories for graphene growth on SiC(0001) are answered. Our in&#8208;depth understanding on graphene nucleation on SiC(0001) extends nucleation mechanisms of 2D crystals and will benefit high&#8208;quality graphene growth on SiC(0001).

         <title>Switchable Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane as Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing topologically chiral [2]catenane as the chiral platform and switching scaffold, the first stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter with |gPL| reaching up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 was successfully constructed. It further serves as an excellent emitter layer for the fabrication of efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).







Abstract
Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (gEL) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |gPL| value up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit a narrow FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6&#8201;%, and CPEL with |gEL| of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |gPL| among the reported CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, it endowed the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with distinctive switchable CPL performances, thus providing a novel design strategy as well as a promising platform for developing intelligent CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Wide Modulation and Reversible Reconfiguration of a Flexible Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Between 645 and 731&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystal that displays long&#8208;distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and a remarkably wide&#8208;range modulation of flexible crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states has been developed based on a pre&#8208;designed self&#8208;absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation position.







Abstract
Flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides, which deliver input or self&#8208;emit light through various dynamic organic crystals, have attracted increasing attention in the past decade. However, the modulation of the waveguide output relies on chemical design and substituent modification, being time&#8208;consuming and laborious. Here we report an elastic organic crystal that displays long&#8208;distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and an ultra&#8208;wide modulation of crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states based on a pre&#8208;designed self&#8208;absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation point. In addition, deep&#8208;red amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) that is able to transduce through a 5.0&#8197;mm bent crystal with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 0.093&#8197;dB/mm has been attained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of flexible organic ASE waveguides. The present study not only provides a simple yet effective strategy to remarkably modulate flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides but also demonstrates the superiority of lasing over normal emission as flexible optical communication elements.

&lt;p&gt;An organic crystal that displays long-distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and a remarkably wide-range modulation of flexible crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states has been developed based on a pre-designed self-absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides, which deliver input or self-emit light through various dynamic organic crystals, have attracted increasing attention in the past decade. However, the modulation of the waveguide output relies on chemical design and substituent modification, being time-consuming and laborious. Here we report an elastic organic crystal that displays long-distance light transduction up to 2.0&#8197;cm and an ultra-wide modulation of crystalline optical waveguides between red (645&#8197;nm) and near infrared (731&#8197;nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states based on a pre-designed self-absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling the irradiation point. In addition, deep-red amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) that is able to transduce through a 5.0&#8197;mm bent crystal with an ultra-low optical loss coefficient of 0.093&#8197;dB/mm has been attained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of flexible organic ASE waveguides. The present study not only provides a simple yet effective strategy to remarkably modulate flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides but also demonstrates the superiority of lasing over normal emission as flexible optical communication elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Multiple Redox&#8208;Active Units into Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active tri(dithiolylidene)cyclohexanetrione centers have been successfully integrated into a series of covalent organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional crystalline structures, excellent stability, high porosity, and good conductivity, and rich Na+ storage sites, making them suitable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF, FPDC&#8208;TPB&#8208;COF, and FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane&#8208;triylidene)tris(dithiole&#8208;diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two&#8208;dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox&#8208;active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent cycling stability (~87&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high rate performance (339&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF&#8208;based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox&#8208;active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox&#8208;active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Hierarchical Nanostructures Featuring Amplified Asymmetry Through Co&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer and Chiral Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical colloidal architectures, characterized by distinct asymmetry, were fabricated through the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with amphiphiles containing chiral amino acid linkers. This study elucidates the regulatory pathways for hierarchical assembly via synergistic effects, highlighting how subtle changes in linker structure can effectively fine&#8208;tune transitions in helical and hierarchical morphology.







Abstract
The widespread presence of hierarchical asymmetric structures in nature has sparked considerable interest because of their unique functionalities. These ingenious structures across multiple scales often emerge from the transfer and amplification of asymmetry from chiral molecules under various synergistic effects. However, constructing artificial chiral asymmetric structures, particularly in developing hierarchical multicomponent structures analogous to those formed in nature through synergistic non&#8208;covalent interactions, still presents tremendous challenges. Herein, we propose a co&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate hierarchical chiral mesostructures by combining a liquid crystalline block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with a small molecular amphiphile containing chiral alanine or phenylalanine as a linker. Through a classic solvent&#8208;exchange process, chiral amphiphiles embedded within LC&#8208;BCP finely regulate the LC ordering effect and facilitate transfer and amplification of asymmetry. Consequently, various co&#8208;assembled structures with significant hierarchical chirality features are obtained through synergetic effects. Remarkably, subtle alterations to the side groups of amino acids in the amphiphiles effectively adjust the hierarchical morphology transition. Moreover, the covalent bonding sequence of amino acids in the amphiphiles emerges as a critical factor governing the formation of hierarchical nanofibers and multilayered vesicles exhibiting a superhelical sense.

         <title>Pd(0)/Pd(II) Electromerism Triggered by Lewis Base Coordination to a Redox&#8208;Active Silicon Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

Z&#8208;type interactions make it possible: Oxidation of the neutral bis(phosphanyl&#8208;amidophenolato)silane Z&#8208;type palladium(0) complex results in a dicationic ligand&#8208;centered singlet diradical/Pd(0) complex. Previously unprecedented Pd(0)/Pd(II) electromerism can be triggered by coordination of a Lewis base to the silane. Abstraction of the Lewis base with silylium ions reverses this electromerism.







Abstract
Electromerism (aka. valence tautomerism) corresponds to the switching of electronic distributions between redox&#8208;active ligands and central elements. While this phenomenon is well established for several transition metals, the Pd(0)/Pd(II) couple could not yet be involved due to the high energy of the Pd(0) state. In this study, we present Pd(0)/Pd(II) electromerism by using a redox&#8208;active bis(phosphanyl&#8208;amidophenolato)silane. Strong silicon&#8208;based Z&#8208;type interaction stabilizes the Pd(0) state with an oxidized dicationic open&#8208;shell singlet ligand while binding of a Lewis base at the Lewis acidic silicon results in the loss of Z&#8208;type interaction and the intramolecular rearrangement to the Pd(II)/reduced ligand electromer. It introduces a novel concept for spin state switching by combining ligand ambiphilicity and redox activity.

Single&#8208;crystal experiments on the novel 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complex [DyDOTA][CrF2(py)4] (DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate, py=pyridine) have revealed a tetragonal easy&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Temperature and magnetic&#8208;field dependent experiments to evaluate the rotating magnetocaloric effect demonstrated the potential of high&#8208;order anisotropies for developing more efficient magnetocaloric materials.







Abstract
Three new 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M=Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln=Dy3+ or Y3+, py=pyridine and DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride&#8208;bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four&#8208;fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy3+ complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and ab initio calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.

Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) can be facilely generated and finely confined adjacent to the reductive sites of WO3 via a gentle photoetching approach. Such photoinduced OVs are advantageous for photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with O2, matching well with the charge carrier dynamics to immediately capture the photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites to activate the adsorbed O2.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with molecular oxygen (O2) is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However, the randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. The oxygen&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Construction of Slide&#8208;Ring Polymers Based on Pillar[5]Arene/Alkyl Chain Host&#8722;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uitilizing the host&#8722;guest complexation between a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), we synthesized a polyrotaxane as a precursor for constructing slide&#8208;ring polymers. The pulley effect in the resultant slide&#8208;ring polymers under external force endows them with a unique stress&#8208;dissipation capability, resulting in outstanding mechanical properties.







Abstract
Slide&#8208;ring polymers exhibit distinctive mechanical properties, making them highly promising for applications in emerging fields such as energy storage devices and smart sensing. However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98&#8197;MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330&#8201;%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92&#8197;MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.

         <title>Homologation of Alkenyl Carbonyls via a Cyclopropanation/Light&#8208;Mediated Selective C&#8722;C Cleavage Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a strategy for the homologation of alkenyl carbonyls via a sequence of cyclopropanation/light&#8208;mediated selective C&#8722;C cleavage. Depending on the substrate structure, intramolecular photoisomerization processes were favored or [3+2] annulations could be developed. Furthermore, a unified reductive strategy for the ring&#8208;opening of carbonyl cyclopropanes was achieved using diphenyl disulfide as a HAT reagent. These transformations open up new possibility for formal CH2 insertion onto the &#945;,&#946; C&#8722;C bond of unsaturated carbonyl compounds, extending the current toolbox for the &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221; of aliphatic carbocycles.







Abstract
We report herein our studies on the direct photoactivation of carbonyl cyclopropanes to give biradical intermediates, leading to selective cleavage of the more substituted carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Depending on the substrate structure, extended alkenes were isolated or directly reacted in a photo&#8208;Nazarov process to give bicyclic products. Based on these results, a unified reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction was developed by using diphenyl disulfide as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent. By performing a sequential cyclopropanation/selective ring opening reaction, we achieved a CH2 insertion into the &#945;,&#946; bond of both acyclic and cyclic unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Our protocol provides a further tool for the modification of the carbon framework of organic compounds, complementing the recent progress in &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;.

         <title>Constructing Tandem Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Systems Based on Structure Adaption to Boost Water Contaminant Mineralization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art water purification technology in addressing water saftey. A conceptualizaiton of tandem reaction system based on structure adaption of target contaminants to reactive oxygen species reactivity was firstly proposed to boost the mineralization of emerging contaminants, which may serve as cost&#8208;attractive mode to design green and high&#8208;efficiency AOPs for advanced water treatment.







Abstract
Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (1O2, HO&#8901; and SO4&#8901;&#8722;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton&#8208;like system, where three replaceable Fe&#8208;centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS exhibited nearly 100&#8201;% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2&#8201;%, 56.2&#8201;% and 60.8&#8201;% for each of the single 1O2/HO&#8901;/SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with 1O2 selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form p&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO4&#8901;&#8722; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and 1O2+HO&#8901;&#8208;TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.

         <title>Photoinduced Bartoli Indole Synthesis by the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes with Nitro(hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis was first reported for the construction of indoles and azaindoles by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. The novel reactivity of N&#8722;O=C dipoles, involving the rearrangement of carbonyl imines, enhances the comprehension of dipole chemistry.







Abstract
Given the unique charm of dipole chemistry, intercepting N&#8722;O=C dipoles precisely generated by designed processes to develop novel reactivity has become a seminal challenge. The polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species generated through the radical addition of excited nitro(hetero)arenes to alkenes represents a significantly underappreciated mechanism for generating N&#8722;O=C dipoles. Herein, we present a photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. Various indoles and azaindoles are constructed through the multi&#8208;step spontaneous rearrangement of carbonyl imine intermediates generated by the polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations support that the reaction involves radical cycloaddition, ozonolysis&#8208;type cycloreversion, intramolecular H&#8208;shift of carbonyl imines, and 3,3&#8208;sigmatropic shift of O&#8208;Alkenyl hydroxylamines, etc. The implementation of continuous&#8208; flow photochemistry, in particular, significantly enhances efficiency, thereby overcoming obstacles to the commercialization process.

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Pd migration is described to achieve enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes. High efficiency with up to 98&#8201;% ee can be achieved in this Pd catalyzed alkenylation and iodo&#8208;migration tandem reaction, which can be applied in the further one&#8208;pot preparation of bifunctionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives.







Abstract
Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98&#8201;% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.

         <title>Cu&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays on Copper Foam for Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterometallic doping strategy was developed to fabricate a bi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derived array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF) for converting nitrogen oxides species coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids into amino acids, which presenting a high selectivity (89&#8201;%) and excellent Faraday efficiency (65.9&#8201;%) towards glycine electrosynthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi and Cu.







Abstract
Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper&#8208;bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89&#8201;%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9&#8201;%. From control experiments, the introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to a lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key intermediate hydroxylamine rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the derivation of MOF arrays ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Helically Twisted Conjugated Frameworks Consisting of Alternant Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Units and Multiple Boron Atoms</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and a helically twisted conjugated framework has led to a family of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems showing red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, with the cis/trans configurational isomers exhibiting similar photophysical properties. The observed narrow, red&#8208;shifted emission could be explained by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A novel design strategy to construct bright and narrow near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission materials with suppressed shoulder peaks can significantly enhance their performance in various applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems bridged by boron atoms, achieving bright red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions with notably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 35&#8197;nm (0.08&#8197;eV) and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) up to 80&#8201;%. These compounds display red&#8208;shifted emissions up to 753&#8197;nm in higher concentrations. Cis/trans configurational isomers of multi&#8208;boron&#8208;bridged molecule BN3 exhibit similar photophysical properties. The unique combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the red&#8208;shifted, narrowband emission. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3&#8208;a reveals that the extension of boron&#8208;bridged D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE&#8208;CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red&#8208;shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought&#8208;after NIR spectrum.

         <title>Enhanced Coplanarity and Giant Birefringence in Hydroxypyridinium Nitrate via Hydrogen Bonding between Planar Donors and Planar Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that utilizes hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors is proposed. Guided by this stratedy, the giant birefringence achieved by ionic crystal, (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, 4HPN, is achieved. This concept has convincingly demonstrated its applicability and relevance across a diverse array of systems, providing a guiding principle in design synthesis.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals, which possess optical anisotropy, are important optical components. However, designing and synthesizing birefringent crystals faces the challenge of achieving anisotropic structures, especially coplanar geometries. Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8722;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a

 value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55&#215;KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.

         <title>Sustaining 500,000 Folding Cycles Through Bioinspired Stress Dispersion Design in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;ever super&#8208;foldable sodium&#8208;ion battery is fabricated via a &#8220;2+1&#8221; biomimetic strategy. The battery can bear 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles in any directions, with no compromise to its structure or performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observation reveals M&#8208;shaped structures cleverly dispersing stress through bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves&#8212;a breakthrough that sets the stage for future super&#8208;foldable devices.







Abstract
Developing super&#8208;foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true&#8208;folding operations (super&#8208;foldable) due to limitations from short&#8208;range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super&#8208;foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super&#8208;foldable devices. By employing a &#8220;2+1&#8221; bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super&#8208;foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super&#8208;foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true&#8208;folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles&#8212;far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observations reveal an M&#8208;shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super&#8208;foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super&#8208;foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super&#8208;foldable devices.

         <title>Regulation of Exciton Effects in Functionalized Conjugated Polymers by B&#8208;N Lewis Pairs for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a B&#8722;N Lewis pair and adjusting Lewis acid basicity could minimize the exciton binding energy and prolong the lifetime of the exciton, thus significantly improving the charge separation and transfer efficiency. PyPBM exhibits an exponentially enhanced activity towards photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production with visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Strong excitonic effects are common in organic conjugated polymer semiconductors, severely hindering the generation of free charge carriers for conducting photocatalysis. Therefore, exploring new channels to modulate exciton dissociation in polymers is far&#8208;reaching in facilitating photocatalysis. A series of B&#8722;N Lewis pair functionalized conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize exciton effects by modulating charge transfer pathways. Theoretical studies have shown that introducing B&#8722;N Lewis pairs can dramatically increase the distance of charge transfer (D index) and the amount of electron transfer and reduce the Coulomb attraction energy (EC), which contributes to breaking the equilibrium of the coexistence of excitons and charge carriers. Further experimental results show that the singlet excitons are efficiently dissociated into more free&#8208;charge carriers under photoexcitation to participate in surface reactions. The optimized polymer PyPBM shows an exponential increase in photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production performance by visible light illumination.

         <title>Inside Cover: Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 5/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron count affects the shape of Bi6q&#8722; units, from a regular prism in Bi62&#8722; (left) to a regular crown&#8208;type cycle in Bi66&#8722; (right). Such units were previously isolated in the coordination sphere of metal complexes, while the (less symmetric) intermediate with a &#8722;4 charge has only been predicted by theory. In their Research Article (e202417234), Florian Weigend, Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. isolated the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; (center), in which two 12&#8208;electron fragments are perfectly suited to stabilize the boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The electron count affects the shape of Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;q&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units, from a regular prism in Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (left) to a regular crown-type cycle in Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (right). Such units were previously isolated in the coordination sphere of metal complexes, while the (less symmetric) intermediate with a &#8722;4 charge has only been predicted by theory. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417234"&gt;e202417234&lt;/a&gt;), Florian Weigend, Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. isolated the Zintl cluster [Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;{Zn(hmds)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (center), in which two 12-electron fragments are perfectly suited to stabilize the boat-type Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; unit, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions enable precise control of (bio)molecular function in biological systems. In their Research Article (e202411707), Hannes Mikula et al. report the development of &#8220;yellow&#8221; hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines as bioorthogonal tools for efficient click&#8208;to&#8208;release of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes. The cover picture illustrates the transformation of &#8220;rusty&#8221; pink tetrazines into &#8220;sharp&#8221; bioorthogonal scissors for rapid and near&#8208;quantitative click&#8208;triggered bond&#8208;cleavage.

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as A New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium batteries are promising post&#8208;lithium technology featuring high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost and sustainability. According to the periodic table, Ca has similar physicochemical properties with Na and Mg in some aspects. This review discusses the similarity and difference between Ca and the other two more matured battery chemistries, hoping to provide new insights into the transport and storage mechanisms that accelerate the development of the emerging technology.







Abstract
The development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies needs to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements into the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca0/Ca2+ redox chemistry in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca&#8208;ions can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Induced PANoptosis: A Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we delve into the foundational concept and underlying mechanisms of PANoptosis, emphasizing its pivotal role in oncology. We subsequently outline the most recent advancements in nanomedicine pertaining to PANoptosis&#8208;driven anticancer therapies. Furthermore, we explore the existing challenges and potential future directions for the clinical translation of PANoptosis&#8208;based treatments.







Abstract
Malignant tumors pose a significant threat to global public health. Promoting programmed cell death in cancer cells has become a critical strategy for cancer treatment. PANoptosis, a newly discovered form of regulated cell death, integrates key molecular components of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, activating these three death pathways simultaneously to achieve synergistic multi&#8208;mechanistic killing. PANoptosis significantly inhibits cancer cell growth and resistance and activates strong anti&#8208;tumor immune response, making tumor&#8208;specific induction of PANoptosis a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. Currently, cancer treatment research related to PANoptosis is focused mainly on the development of small molecules and cytokines. However, these approaches still face limitations in terms of metabolic stability and tumor specificity. The unique physicochemical properties and biological activities of nanomaterials hold significant promise for optimizing PANoptosis induction strategies. This review summarizes the concept and mechanisms of PANoptosis, highlights the latest applications of nanoagents in PANoptosis&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer therapy, and discusses the challenges and future directions for clinical translation. It is hoped that this review will inspire further exploration and development of PANoptosis&#8208;based cancer treatments, providing new perspectives for researchers in the field.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalysts: From Model to Reality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively utilized in catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. This review summarizes the progress of 2D materials from model studies to application in catalysis and illustrates how 2D materials serve as models to explore structure&#8211;activity relationships by combining theoretical calculations and surface research.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well&#8208;defined structures. With easily identified structure&#8208;modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure&#8208;function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalysts. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal, and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure&#8208;activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface research. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed. This review provides a reference for the design of catalyst structure and composition, and could inspire the realization of two&#8208;dimensional materials from model study to reality application in industry.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well-defined structures. With easily identified structure-modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure-function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalysts. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal, and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure-activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface research. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed. This review provides a reference for the design of catalyst structure and composition, and could inspire the realization of two-dimensional materials from model study to reality application in industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Upgrading to Biodegradable Plastics through Photo/Electro&#8208;Synthetic Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

This review focuses on innovative strategies for converting CO2 into biodegradable polymers, addressing environmental challenges like CO2 emissions and plastic waste. It explores catalytic CO2 conversion, including photocatalytic&#8208;biological and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological hybrid systems, aiming to optimize processes and catalyst efficiency.







Abstract
The escalating emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and the pervasive issue of nondegradable plastic pollution underscore dual urgent challenges in pursuit of a sustainable society. Achieving such sustainability in the plastic industry, while effectively addressing these environmental concerns, necessitates the development and implementation of innovative strategies for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers utilizing CO2 as feedstocks. The technologies not only facilitate the mitigation of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations but also introduce a renewable carbon resource for polymer manufacturing. While considerable research has been undertaken in CO2 upgrading to various C1&#8208;3 products, the production of biodegradable polymers from CO2 remains a formidable challenge. Here, we delineate the principal methodologies for catalytic CO2 upgrading to biodegradable polymers, encompassing photocatalytic&#8208;biological processes and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological approaches. The emphasis of this perspective is on the optimization of production processes and catalyst efficiency, which are paramount in addressing the imperative challenge of decarbonization in the plastic industry, thereby aligning with global environmental sustainability goals.

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse fluorinated polyphenylene undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8722;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9&#8201;%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total and has an unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure. It can be resolved via chiral HPLC, displays distinct chiroptical properties, and forms strong through&#8208;cavity threading complex.







Abstract
We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8722;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9&#8201;%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272;=1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Golden Fullerene Au42 with Unprecedented Metal Coordination Number of 15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;golden fullerene&#8221; Au42 cluster topologically related to D3h C78 has a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26 featuring record high metal coordination number of 15. Its excellent stability is attributed to both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.







Abstract
A golden fullerene with a composition of [Au42(Ph3P)10(5&#8208;CF3&#8208;Hpa)8] (CF3COO)2 (5&#8208;CF3&#8208;H2pa=5&#8208;trifluoropyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;amine) (Au42) has been synthesized with pyridylamino and phosphine ligands as the protecting agents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that the cluster has a D3h Au4210+ core, which can be depicted as a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26. The 41 Au atoms of the Au15@Au26 core&#8211;shell can be derived from placing a gold atom in the center of each polygon of C78 (D3h). Surprisingly, the centered gold atom of this noble cluster has the highest coordination number in metal nanoclusters of 15. Quantum&#8208;chemical studies suggest that the excellent stability of Au42 results from both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.

         <title>Doping Copper(I) in Ag7 Cluster for Circularly Polarized OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu were prepared in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield through precise substitution of the central Ag(I) atom in R/S&#8208;Ag7 with Cu(I), which not only triples quantum yield of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also doubles the CPL asymmetry factor. Solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) achieves the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high&#8208;yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters R/S&#8208;Ag7, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90&#8201;%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07&#8197;eV) between S1 and T1 states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of R/S&#8208;Ag7 and R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%) in place of phosphorescence (15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;%). Relative to those of R/S&#8208;Ag7, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu due to accelerating ISC (intersystem crossing) and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8722;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%, which is superior to most of red&#8208;emitting OLEDs through solution process.

   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90&#8201;%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07&#8197;eV) between S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%) in place of phosphorescence (15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;%). Relative to those of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; due to accelerating ISC (intersystem crossing) and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;/b&gt; ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8722;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution-processable circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) demonstrate high-efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%, which is superior to most of red-emitting OLEDs through solution process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two substrates, tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine, are used in parallel by Cinchona to generate the naturally occurring mixtures of methoxy and non&#8208;methoxy Cinchona alkaloids. Discovery of the genes responsible for methoxylation allows reconstitution of biosynthetic intermediates in tobacco.







Abstract
Quinine is a historically important natural product containing a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.

         <title>Activation and C&#8722;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic formation of C&#8211;C bonds from aryl halides is a highly attractive but unexplored area in the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis. We report a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to forge C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds via C&#8211;H functionalization. The bismuth complex features two different light&#8208;driven processes: an MLCT transition that promotes oxidative addition into Bi(I) and an LLCT&#8208;enabled homolytic cleavage of aryl&#8211;Bi(III) bonds.







Abstract
Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8722;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8722;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.

         <title>Highly Strained, Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Cyclophanes: Template&#8208;free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly strained porphyrin&#8208;based cyclophane (1) was synthesized using a template&#8208;free method starting from a porphyrin quinone (2). The neutral compound exhibits localized aromaticity, while its dicationic form demonstrates a combination of global aromaticity across the macrocycle and localized antiaromaticity within the porphyrin units.







Abstract
Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.

         <title>Stabilisation of a Strontium Hydride with a Monodentate Carbazolyl Ligand and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular strontium hydride was stabilised by a bulky monodentate ligand and arene co&#8208;ligands. Characteristic vibrations of the Sr2H2 core were identified and the reactivity patterns were studied with regard to addition, redox and base reactivity.







Abstract
The molecular strontium hydride 2 [(dtbpCbz)SrH(L)]2 (L=benzene, toluene) was isolated and stabilized by employing a sterically demanding carbazole ligand (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). Compound 2 was synthesized via phenylsilane metathesis with the corresponding amide (dtbpCbz)SrN(SiMe3)2 and characterized by 1H NMR, XRD and vibrational spectroscopy methods. We further investigated the stoichiometric reactivity of 2 towards carbon monoxide, azobenzene and trimethylsilylacetylene, showing three distinct reactivity pathways: addition, reduction and deprotonation. The reaction of 2 with carbon monoxide yields the ethenediolate complex 4 via addition, while with azobenzene reduction of the N&#8722;N double bond and release of hydrogen were observed, affording a heteroleptic strontium complex with a radical azobenzenyl ligand (5). The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the hydride moiety to give the acetylide complex 6.

         <title>Propeller&#8208;Shaped Blatter&#8208;Based Triradicals: Distortion&#8208;Free Triangular Spin System and Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Dependent Photophysical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of propeller&#8208;shaped C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric triradicals are described. The triradicals were antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin systems with J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K, leading to the thermal equilibrium of the doublet/quartet states at room temperature. The spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent absorption feature, spin&#8208;selective excitation, and spin&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics are discussed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable triradicals. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped triradicals were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interactions J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K and &#8722;106&#8197;K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The triradicals exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000&#8197;nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monoradical&#8208;like excited state.

         <title>Independent LUMO Reactivity in Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Thiones: Synthesis of a Stable Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a series of abnormal carbene&#8208;derived air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs). The mNHTs showed independent LUMO reactivity, leveraging its positive charge. In particular, it resulted in the synthesis of a stable radical anion by chemical reduction of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thione.







Abstract
Mesoionic compounds, with positive and negative charges, are expected to have dual&#8208;site highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, donor) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, acceptor) reactivity. Herein, we report a novel class of air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs) synthesized from abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs). DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual&#8208;site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring. The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X&#8208;raydiffraction study. Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2 gas, C&#8722;Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C&#8722;X (X = F, Br) bonds. This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.

         <title>Formation of H2O2 in Near&#8208;Neutral Zn&#8208;air Batteries Enables Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes show promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices but face slow charge kinetics. This study reveals a charge storage mechanism mediated by H2O2 formation during discharge and oxidation during charge, influenced by electrolyte composition and electrode material. Facile oxidation of H2O2 enables low overpotentials and suppresses carbon corrosion.







Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of near&#8208;neutral Zn&#8208;air batteries that is mediated by formation of dissolved hydrogen peroxide upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. This H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at ~1.5&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn, reducing charge overpotentials by ~0.2&#8211;0.5&#8197;V and mitigating carbon corrosion&#8212;a common issue in ZABs. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, contributing up to ~60&#8201;% of the capacity with ZnSO4 solutions and carbon nanotubes. Enhancing the H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway offers a route to higher energy efficiency and durability in near&#8208;neutral ZABs, advancing practical, sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Modular Access to C2&#8217;&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Nucleosides with Electrochemical Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8217;&#8208;modifications of nucleosides represent a key structural feature in many nucleoside&#8208;based therapeutics, though the development of efficient synthetic methodologies remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a modular and highly efficient approach for the C2&#8217;&#8208;arylation/alkenylation of nucleosides via electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling, which delivers excellent &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity and broad functional group compatibility. Using this method, we synthesized a series of C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides that exhibited notable effects on DNA duplex melting temperatures (Tm), enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease degradation, and retained efficient cellular uptake.







Abstract
Chemically modified oligonucleotides have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology due to their enhanced stability in vivo compared to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. However, current methods for synthesizing modified nucleosides, particularly at the C2&#8217;&#8208;position, are limited in terms of efficiency, modularity, and selectivity. Herein, we report a new approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized C2&#8217;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides via an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8217;&#8208;bromo nucleosides with a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkenyl iodides. This method affords a diverse array of C2&#8217;&#8208; &#945;&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides with excellent stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. We further synthesized oligonucleotides incorporating C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified thymidine moieties and demonstrated that their annealed double&#8208;stranded DNAs exhibit decreased melting temperatures (Tm). Additionally, oligonucleotides with C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl modifications at the 3&#8217; end showed enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease degradation and C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl modifications did not impede the cellular uptake process, highlighting the potential of these modified oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications.

Synergistic photochemical Pd/carbonyl catalysis enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of NH2&#8208;unprotected &#945;&#8208;amino esters with styrenes and alkyl bromides, affording an efficient new strategy for modular synthesis of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.

         <title>Dicyanocarbene&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Efficient Quinoidization for the Development of Fused N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new quinoidization reaction has been developed based on 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile (DMSM). This reaction avoids the reliance on halogenated substrates and has unique reactivity to the electron&#8208;rich fused aromatics. Various new quinoidal compounds were synthesized, and one of them exhibits a high electron mobility up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results provide a new synthetic method to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Dicyanomethylene&#8208;terminated quinoidal materials are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring excellent electron mobilities and air stability. Traditional synthetic methods of these materials such as Takahashi reaction, require the use of expensive palladium catalyst and halogenated substrates. However, for electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, the poor stability after halogenation renders their halogenated derivatives unsuitable as reaction precursors. To address this issue, we present a new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach using 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile as the quinoidization reagent, which is successfully applied to various electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, leading to the corresponding quinoidal compounds with high yields up to 94&#8201;%. We proposed the reaction mechanism, and investigated the physical properties of four fused quinoidal materials based on highly electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, which are scarce to be synthesized by the traditional method. Furthermore, these fused quinoidal materials were utilized in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving high electron mobilities up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. We provide an effective synthetic approach to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors.

         <title>Engineered Nanobodies Bind Bismuth, Indium and Gallium for Applications in Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching metals to antibodies involves using bifunctional linkers that contain both a reactive and chelating group. This study eliminates the need for such linkers by incorporating the metal directly within a single&#8208;domain antibody. This is demonstrated for gallium, indium, and bismuth, addressing both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in positron emission tomography, single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, and targeted alpha therapy.







Abstract
Targeted theranostics heavily rely on metal isotopes conjugated to antibodies. Single&#8208;domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, are much smaller in size without compromising specificity and affinity. The conventional way of conjugating metals to nanobodies involves non&#8208;specific modification of amino acid residues with bifunctional chelating agents. We demonstrate that mutagenesis of a single residue in a nanobody creates a triple cysteine motif that selectively binds bismuth which is, for example, used in targeted alpha therapy. Two mutations create a quadruple cysteine mutant specific for gallium and indium used in positron emission tomography and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Labelling is quantitative within a few minutes. The metal nanobodies maintain structural integrity and stability over weeks, resist competition from endogenous metal binders like glutathione, and retain functionality.

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkynes by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aromatic aldimines with internal alkynes via C&#8722;H activation has been achieved in an enantioselective fashion. A noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent on the chiral cyclopentadienyl ligand of a scandium catalyst and the phenyl ring of an aldimine substrate plays an important role in enhancing the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The enantioselective [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aldimines with alkynes via C&#8722;H activation is, in principle, a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for synthesizing chiral 1&#8208;aminoindenes, which are important components in a wide array of natural products, bioactive molecules, and functional materials. However, such asymmetric transformation has remained undeveloped to date due to the lack of suitable chiral catalysts. Here, we report for the first time the enantioselective [3+2] annulation of aldimines with alkynes via C&#8722;H activation using chiral half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol enabled the synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;substituted chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) analyses have revealed that a noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent in the chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand and the phenyl ring of an aromatic aldimine substrate played an important role in achieving a high level of enantioselectivity. This work not only offers an efficient and selective route for synthesizing a new family of chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives but also offers unprecedented insights into enantioselectivity control in chiral Cp&#8208;ligated metal catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light is an optimal stimulus to control the functioning of chemical systems, as it is clean, traceless, and easily applied. In this work we demonstrate a new way to couple catalytic activity to light input by encapsulating an aldehyde&#8208;reduction catalyst within a cage that opens upon illumination. This concept may enable illumination to be geared with catalytic activity for other reactions, including industrially relevant ones.







Abstract
We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350&#8197;nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 2.5&#8197;h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.

         <title>Mimicking the CO2&#8208;Bound State of the [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stepwise assembly the tailoring of complexes with NiII&#8208;(&#956;2&#8208;CO2)&#8208;MII entities (M=Fe, Co, Zn), resembling the structural motif found in an intermediate of the carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase, has been achieved. It was revealed that the transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22&#8722; (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM=Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni&#8208;CO2&#8208;Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2&#8208;conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion instead of a s&#8208; or p&#8208;block&#8208;based Lewis acid as part of the active site.

         <title>Dication Disulfuranes as Photoactivatable Sources of Radical Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic dication disulfuranes release highly reactive isothiouronium radicals upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. These disulfuranes represent the first class of visible&#8208;light activatable reservoirs of radical organocatalysts in covalent radical catalysis, showing exceptional efficiency in the aerobic synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;diketones under mild conditions.







Abstract
The recent development of photoredox and energy transfer catalysis has led to a significant expansion of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven chemical transformations. These methods have demonstrated exceptional efficiency in converting a wide range of substrates into radical intermediates and generating open&#8208;shell catalytic species. However, the simplification of catalytic systems and the direct generation of highly reactive radical organocatalysts through direct visible&#8208;light irradiation from stable precatalysts remains largely an unrealized goal. This challenge is mainly due to the limited availability of precatalysts that are responsive to visible light. Herein, we introduce a new class of bench&#8208;stable dicationic disulfuranes, which release highly reactive thiyl radicals upon blue&#8208;light excitation. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that this reactivity arises from a combination of structural features and intermolecular interactions. This family of molecules has been employed to catalyze radical cascades previously incompatible with photoredox conditions, enabling the efficient formation of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;hydroxyketones in excellent yields and short reaction times.

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate Diagnosis and Efficient Clearance of Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) is reported for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes. FLAGC is easily drained to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for precise localization. FLAGC is then specifically lit up by the low pH and over&#8208;expressed myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in an accurate diagnosis of metastatic SLNs by chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window. Further, the tumor was efficiently eradicated through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our findings offer a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically positive lymph nodes.







Abstract
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC is easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggers the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes is achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.

         <title>Pooled Nanoparticle Screening Using a Chemical Barcoding Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl halide&#8208;based small molecule barcodes (halocodes) are used for pooled quantification of polymeric and liposomal nanoparticles in vitro and ex vivo. Halocodes are compatible with multiple classes of nanocarriers and have modular attachment, extensive parameter space, and low limits of detection with mass spectrometry&#8208;based technologies. This work demonstrates a promising new nanoparticle barcoding technology to expedite nanoparticle screening.







Abstract
We report the development of a small molecule&#8208;based barcoding platform for pooled screening of nanoparticle delivery. Using aryl halide&#8208;based tags (halocodes), we achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or electron capture. This enables barcoding and tracking of nanoparticles with minimal halocode concentrations and without altering their physicochemical properties. To demonstrate the utility of our platform for pooled screening, we synthesized a halocoded library of polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles and quantified uptake in ovarian cancer cells in a pooled manner. Our findings correlate with conventional fluorescence&#8208;based assays. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of halocodes for spatial mapping of nanoparticles using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Halocoding presents an accessible and modular nanoparticle screening platform capable of quantifying delivery of pooled nanocarrier libraries in a range of biological settings.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8211;Ene Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green thiol&#8208;ene: A thiol&#8208;ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self&#8208;immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end&#8208;caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde&#8208;derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.







Abstract
The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.

     alt="Self-Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8211;Ene Chemistry**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green thiol-ene&lt;/b&gt;: A thiol-ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self-immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6-elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end-caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde-derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end-of-life or to achieve specific stimuli-responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self-immolative polymers based on lignin-derived aldehydes via a simple thiol-ene polymerization. These self-immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6-elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end-caps could be introduced through post-polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;Chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective photooxidation of commodity and postconsumer polyolefins to produce materials with in&#8208;chain ketones without using catalysts or expensive oxidants. Under mild conditions, yields reached up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones, improving adhesion compared to unfunctionalized plastics. These ketones enable reaction with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks, upcycling mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Promoting Charge&#8208;Carriers Dynamics by Relaxed Lattice Strain in A&#8208;site&#8208;Doped Halide Perovskite for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;active alkali metal was doped into CsPbBr3, and the occupied locations were first revealed, which would change from A&#8208;site to interstitial site with K+ concentrations increased. Because of relaxed lattice strain, charge&#8208;carriers dynamics were promoted, leading to an ~11&#8208;fold enhancement of solar hydrogen generation rate for CsPbBr3 with K+ A&#8208;site doping.







Abstract
Because of the unique and superior optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted great interest in photocatalysis. Element doping strategy is adopted to modify perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance. However, the contribution of bare doping&#8208;site onto photocatalytic efficiency, and the correlation between doping locations and activity have not yet to be demonstrated. The unique properties of non&#8208;active alkali metals promoted us to systematically explore the potential of A&#8208;site&#8208;doped MHPs for photocatalysis. Herein, we dope potassium (K+) into CsPbBr3 via an anti&#8208;solvent precipitation method and first reveal that the occupied locations of K+ in CsPbBr3 is lattice incorporation rather than surface segregation, which would change from A&#8208;site substitution to interstitial site in lattice with the increase of K+ concentrations. Taking hydrogen (H2) evolution as a model reaction, photocatalytic activity of CsPbBr3 after K+ doping could be significantly improved ~11&#8208;fold with A&#8208;site substitution, which is superior to that of interstitial site doping. Moreover, other alkali metals including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and rubidium (Rb) doping give the same results. The structure of photocatalysts during reaction confirmed the contribution of A&#8208;site doping onto enhanced photocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights show it is a result of the relaxed lattice strain induced promoted charge&#8208;carriers dynamics and upward shifting of band after K+ A&#8208;site doping.

         <title>Phenanthridine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall Solar H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral phenanthridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time and exhibited boosting H2O2 photosynthetic activities. Introducing phenanthridine units realized one stone three birds: regulate the charge carrier dynamics, favor the reaction thermodynamics in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels, and serve as photooxidation centers for 2e&#8722; WOR, thereby enhancing the overall solar H2O2 generation performance.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels is green and sustainable but severely restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing intriguing photocatalysts with effective active centers is a shortcut to breaking the kinetic bottleneck with great significance. Herein, we synthesize two novel neutral phenanthridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2) for photosynthesizing H2O2. Compared to the no phenanthridine counterpart (AN&#8208;COF), the H2O2 photosynthetic activities of PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2 are markedly boosted. In air and pure water without sacrificial agents, under Xe lamp and natural sunlight, the H2O2 photogeneration rate of PD&#8208;COF2 is 6103 and 3646&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively. Further experimental and theoretical inspections demonstrate that introducing phenanthridine units into COFs smoothly modulates the charge carrier dynamics and thermodynamically favors the generation of crucial OOH* and OH* intermediates in the ORR and WOR paths, respectively. Additionally, this is the first time the neutral phenanthridine moiety serves as the photooxidation unit for 2e&#8722; WOR towards H2O2 photoproduction. The current work sheds light on exploring novel catalytic centers for high&#8208;performance H2O2 evolution.

An integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives was proposed, by employing this strategy, new solid additive PyMC5 was designed. Compared with its counterpart PyDC5, PyMC5 is capable of enhancing the photo&#8208;/thermal&#8208;stability of the device and boosting the power conversion efficiency of the binary OSC to 19.52&#8201;%, this result is among the best efficiencies reported so far.







Abstract
Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non&#8208;volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non&#8208;volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency&#8208;boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non&#8208;volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology. Notably, the binary device (PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO) treated by PyMC5 achieved a PCE over 19.5&#8201;%, ranking among the highest reported to date. In addition, the integration of PyMC5 mitigated the degradation process of the devices under photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stress conditions. This work demonstrates an efficient integrated omnidirectional approach for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives, offering a promising avenue for further advancements in OSC development.

Abstract
Oxetanes are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry applications, with demonstrated potential to serve as bioisosteres for an array of functional groups. Through the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox hydrodecarboxylation of 2&#8208;aryl oxetane 2&#8208;carboxylic acids this work enables access to the products of a [2+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition between alkenes and aryl aldehydes without the challenges associated with a traditional UV&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. Investigation into the hydrodecarboxylation mechanism reveals substrate&#8208;dependent modes of initiation under the conditions reported herein. Divergence in diastereomeric outcome is observed, with mechanistic probes elucidating key hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric interactions.

         <title>Opening the Hysteresis Loop in Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 Nanosheets Through Functionalization with TCNQ Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonic liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation of a layered ferromagnet, Fe3GeTe2, produces nanosheets with weak coercivity of ~0.1&#8197;T. The nanosheets react with an organic acceptor, TCNQ, to yield an FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite with a 5&#8208;fold increase in coercivity.







Abstract
Ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), whose structure exhibits weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions between 5&#8208;atom thick layers, was subjected to liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) in N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to yield a suspension of nanosheets that were separated into several fractions by successive centrifugation at different speeds. Electron microscopy confirmed successful exfoliation of bulk FGT to nanosheets as thin as 6&#8197;nm. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature for the nanosheets gradually decreased with the increase in the centrifugation speed used to isolate the 2D material. These nanosheets were resuspended in NMP and treated with an organic acceptor, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;quinodimethane (TCNQ), which led to precipitation of FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The formation of the composite material is accompanied by charge transfer from the FGT nanosheets to TCNQ molecules, generating TCNQ&#8901;&#8722; radical anions, as revealed by experimental vibrational spectra and supported by first principles calculations. Remarkably, a substantial increase in magnetic anisotropy was observed, as manifested by the increase in the coercive field from nearly zero in bulk FGT to 1.0&#8197;kOe in the exfoliated nanosheets and then to 5.4&#8197;kOe in the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The dramatic increase in coercivity of the composite suggests that functionalization with redox&#8208;active molecules provides an appealing pathway to enhancing magnetic properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Carbon Defects as Highly Active Sites for Gold Detection and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon defects of carbon dot as an active sites for the reduction of gold. The formation of gold particles involves the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (fast) and an Ostwald ripening process (slow). Importantly, this process occurs independently of interference from other ions, and self&#8208;settling is observed in this mechanism. This interplay between carbon defects and gold ions highlights a nuanced pathway for the creation of Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
The use of precious metals (PMs) in many areas, such as printed circuit boards, catalysts, and target drugs, is increasing due to their unique physical and chemical properties, but their recovery remains a great challenge in terms of zero&#8208;valent PMs as the final product. We report a highly hydrophilic carbon dot (CD) as a reductant (electron donor), in which the defects in CD served as efficient active sites for zero&#8208;valent PMs recovery with an electron&#8208;donating capacity of ~1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The reduction of gold follows a two&#8208;step dynamic model characterized by the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (initial rapid electron transfer process) followed by an Ostwald ripening process (subsequent slow process). Finite element method (FEM) simulation shows that the reaction efficiency and confinement effect of AuCl4&#8722; ions are positively correlated with defect density, indicating that the quantitative control of carbon defect density is the key to enhancing reduction activity. Combining density functional theory (DFT) with XPS and FTIR technology, we found that the electron is transferred from CD to Au(III) via hydrogen bonding. This nano carbon material can be exploited to recover gold from e&#8208;waste water directly, with the characteristics of reducing energy consumption and avoiding environmental pollution.

Bid farewell to fevers brought on by ovalbumin while rebalancing your humoral equilibrium with this modern self&#8208;adjuvanting marvel! Be no longer a captive to affliction&#8211;procure your bottle forthwith and witness the rejuvenating wonders of COFs!







Abstract
Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.

&lt;p&gt;Step right up and feast your eyes upon the COF Vaccine&#8211;an elixir for the ages, formulated with the latest large-pore COFs, it forms a depot of vitality-enhancing antigens! Bid farewell to fevers brought on by ovalbumin while rebalancing your humoral equilibrium with this modern self-adjuvanting marvel! Be no longer a captive to affliction&#8211;procure your bottle forthwith and witness the rejuvenating wonders of COFs!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine-associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half-life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell-mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen-presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for toxic carbon disulfide (CS2) with an ultrafast response time of 10&#8197;s at room temperature. Ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence systems developed in this work demonstrated that the manipulation of energetic relaxation at the excited state with CS2 adsorption led to the luminescence response with outstanding visibility.







Abstract
Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2 is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2 adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in a gold(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz=pyrazine; 1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network. Ex&#8197;situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for 1 and CS2&#8208;accommodated 1 suggested that the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2 modulating the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2 and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure. Based on the obtained structural transformation, 1 exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2 with an ultrafast response time of less than 10&#8197;s. Moreover, ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2 varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of IrB1.15 Nanocrystals for Efficient Chlorine and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic compounds of IrB1.15 have been successfully synthesized by ultrafast Joule heating at 900&#8201;&#176;C for a duration of 12&#8197;seconds, showcasing their robust electrocatalytic performance in acidic saline water media for both chlorine and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75&#8197;mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90&#8197;h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0&#8197;eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, in situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.

Self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) are synthesized through peptide self&#8208;assembly, including anti&#8208;PD&#8722;L1 peptide, self&#8208;assembling linker and E3 ligase recruiter. The PT&#8208;NPs utilize multivalent binding for PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeted endocytosis, effective degrading PD&#8722;L1 receptors in tumor cells via dual degradation mechanisms: direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;mediated degradation, offering a potent approach to cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8&#8197;nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8722;L1 to form PD&#8722;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8722;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8722;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We hereby present the generation of lipid vesicles under relatively low concentrations of lipid molecules (approximately 1&#8197;mM) and mild conditions within coacervate microdroplets. This finding suggests that analogous processes could have taken place on the early Earth, providing a novel perspective on the conditions conducive to the development of cellular systems. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of non&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics in the formation of organized functional compartments. It elucidates that the binding energy between surfactants and oppositely charged components, which constitute the coacervate microdroplet, plays a pivotal role in governing the spatiotemporal distribution of surfactants within the coacervate microdroplet.







Abstract
The spontaneous emergence of lipid vesicles in the absence of evolved biological machinery represents a major challenge for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. We show that coacervate microdroplets could create a compartmentalized environment that enriches lipid molecules and facilitates their spontaneous assembly into lipid vesicles. These vesicles can escape from the coacervate microdroplets in a continuous process under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, resembling a constant production process akin to a &#8220;primitive enzyme&#8221; factory assembly line. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the intricate interaction between lipid molecules and coacervate microdroplets, shedding light on the emergence of cellular systems and offering a new perspective on the conditions necessary for the development of life on Earth.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane Using CO2 as a Soft Oxidant over the Au/TiO2&#8722;Vo Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of metal&#8208;support interface site by anchoring metal quantum dots on the oxide nanosheets to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2, with efforts to achieve high&#8208;activity photocatalytic OCM to C2H6 with CO2 as a soft oxidant. M1 and M2 represent the metal atoms of the quantum dots and the oxide nanosheets, respectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) offers an appealing route for converting greenhouse gas into valuable C2 hydrocarbons. However, O2, as the most commonly used oxidant, tends to result in inevitable overoxidation and waste of methane feedstock. Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is designed and constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77&#8197;eV via Au&#8722;C and Ti&#8722;O dual&#8208;site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 on the photocatalyst reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59&#8197;eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3&#8722;Au interaction and accelerating CH3&#8722;CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane. This work highlights the importance of soft oxidants for improving oxidation reaction efficiency and provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for CH4 conversion.

         <title>Precision Activity&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Amylase Probes for Dissection and Annotation of Linear and Branched&#8208;Chain Starch&#8208;Degrading Enzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes were designed as a method to annotate substrate specificity of retaining &#945;&#8208;amylases. Fluorescent probes were used in activity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments with pure protein, a prominent gut microbe and in a species&#8208;rich composter sample. Proteomics experiments were performed to identify, and annotate the substrate specificity of, novel &#945;&#8208;amylases with favourable properties for the industrial processing of starch.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amylases are the workhorse enzymes of starch degradation. They are central to human health, including as targets for anti&#8208;diabetic compounds, but are also the key enzymes in the industrial processing of starch for biofuels, corn syrups, brewing and detergents. Dissection of the activity, specificity and stability of &#945;&#8208;amylases is crucial to understanding their biology and allowing their exploitation. Yet, functional characterization lags behind DNA sequencing and genomics; and new tools are required for rapid analysis of &#945;&#8208;amylase function. Here, we design, synthesize and apply new branched &#945;&#8208;amylase activity&#8208;based probes. Using both &#945;&#8208;1,6 branched and unbranched &#945;&#8208;1,4 maltobiose activity&#8208;based probes we were able to explore the stability and substrate specificity of both a panel of human gut microbial &#945;&#8208;amylases and a panel of industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;amylases. We also demonstrate how we can detect and annotate the substrate specificity of &#945;&#8208;amylases in the complex cell lysate of both a prominent gut microbe and a diverse compost sample by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and mass spectrometry. A toolbox of starch&#8208;active activity&#8208;based probes will enable rapid functional dissection of &#945;&#8208;amylases. We envisage activity&#8208;based probes contributing to better selection and engineering of enzymes for industrial application as well as fundamental analysis of enzymes in human health.

         <title>Enhancing battery longevity by regulating the solvation chemistry of organic iodide</title>

Incorporating formamidinium iodide into zinc&#8208;iodine batteries regulates the solvation chemistry to enhance redox kinetics and suppress polyiodide dissolution for improved longevity.







Abstract
For rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, the low electrical conductivity of iodine and the easy dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte need to be carefully managed to ensure efficient operation. Herein, we introduce an organic iodized salt, formamidinium iodide (CH5N2I), to modulate the solvation structure of iodide ion, aimed to improve the reaction kinetics of iodine for reversible redox conversion. The participation of formamidinium ion (FA+) into solvation structure leads to the formation of the favorable FAIZn(H2O)42+ complex, facilitating easier desolvation for redox conversion with iodine. Consequently, the inhibited formation of soluble polyiodide efficiently suppresses self&#8208;discharging and improves reversible redox conversion. Specifically, the fabricated battery demonstrates extraordinary cycling stability, with 90.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. These results provide inspiring principles to develop organohalide materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries through the solvation modification and interface regulation strategies.

         <title>Degradable Radical Polymer Cathode for Lithium Battery with Long&#8208;Term Cycling Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A degradable radical polymer cathode (co&#8208;PTN) is initially synthesized by copolymerizing 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran with norbornene derivatives. The incorporation of nitroxide radicals in the side groups and enol ether linkage makes the polymer electrochemical stability and degradability under acidic treatment. The corresponding Li//co&#8208;PTN battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 100.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a long cycle life of over 1000 cycles.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based organic electrodes for rechargeable batteries are attractive due to their design flexibility, sustainability, and environmental compatibility. Unfortunately, waste management of conventional polymer materials typically involves incineration, which emits greenhouse gases. Consequently, degradable polymers should be ideal candidates for future green batteries. However, to date, degradable polymer electrodes have been rarely reported. The few that have been developed exhibit very low capacities (&lt;40&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and poor cycle stability (&lt;100 cycles). Herein, we synthesize a degradable polymer cathode for lithium batteries by copolymerizing 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran with TEMPO&#8208;containing norbornene derivatives. This polymer cathode demonstrates a two&#8208;electron redox reaction charge storage mechanism, exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 100.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a long cycle life of over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, under a mild acidic environment, this polymer electrode material undergoes complete decomposition via the hydrolysis of enol ethers, confirmed by gel permeation chromatography and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. These encouraging results shed light on the design of degradable polymer electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;A degradable radical polymer cathode (co-PTN) is initially synthesized by copolymerizing 2,3-dihydrofuran with norbornene derivatives. The incorporation of nitroxide radicals in the side groups and enol ether linkage makes the polymer electrochemical stability and degradability under acidic treatment. The corresponding Li//co-PTN battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 100.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a long cycle life of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Repaired Solvation Structure Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Phosphate&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Potassium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in potassium&#8208;ion batteries are prone to excessive weak solvation. An entropic repair strategy is proposed for the solvation structure of potassium ions, and a high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with moderately weak solvation is systematically designed. The repaired electrolyte has high interface stability and ionic conductivity, and is nonflammable.







Abstract
The safety and cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are deeply associated with potassium&#8208;ion electrolytes. However, due to the weak Lewis acidity of potassium ions, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in PIBs are prone to excessive weak solvation. Herein, we propose an entropy repair strategy for the solvation structure of potassium ions and systematically design a moderately weakly solvated high&#8208;entropy localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. The repaired electrolyte can achieve an average stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% on the Cu collector surface. The potassium symmetric battery can be stably cycled for over 10000&#8197;h under a high current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large deposition capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The potassium metal pouch cell, using K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94&#8901;0.5H2O as the cathode, maintains a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even when the current density is increased tenfold from 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery still retains 67.1&#8201;% of its capacity. Additionally, due to the introduction of multiple solvents, the potassium metal battery with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode can maintain reversible capacities of 94.0 and 77.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and operate stably at ambient temperatures of &#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Selectivity in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction through First Coordination Shell Engineering in Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

Co single&#8208;atom sites with different N/O coordination are synthesized using a precursor preselection strategy to investigate their effect on selectivity and activity in the two&#8208;electron ORR. The trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 site achieves an optimal balance between selectivity and activity, reaching a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 0.07&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;J&#8722;1 in a 100&#8208;hour flow&#8208;cell test.







Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a potentially cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly route for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the competing 4e&#8722; ORR that converts oxygen to water limits the selectivity towards hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, achieving highly selective H2O2 production under low voltage conditions remains challenging. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that modulation the first coordination sphere in Co single atom catalysts (Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x sites), specifically the replacement of Co&#8722;N bonds with Co&#8722;O bonds, can weaken the *OOH adsorption strength to boost the selectivity towards H2O2 (albeit with a slight decrease in ORR activity). Further, by synthesizing a series of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x active sites, we were able to validate the DFT findings and explore the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity for 2e&#8722; ORR. A catalyst with trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 sites exhibited excellent catalytic activity and H2O2 selectivity, affording a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic cation with multiple cationic sites was introduced into electrolyte to attract solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ through electrostatic interactions resulting in enhanced Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process.







Abstract
Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10&#8197;C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles) at 4.6&#8197;V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>

One&#8208;pot blending of a pair of tris&#8208;monodentate ligands and Pd(II) resulted in a mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;3D&#8208;cavity coordination cage, for the first time, as driven by orientational compatibility of ligand strands. Mixing Pd(II) with these ligands in separate&#8208;pots afforded homo&#8208;ligated cages where orientational compatibility of ligand strands is modulated by &#8220;neighbouring cage participation&#8221;.







Abstract
Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands in 3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Stapled Helical Peptides for Targeting Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium&#8208;stapling is a versatile and straightforward macrocyclization strategy that is performed selectively on solid support by crosslinking two amino side chains. It does not only stabilize the helical structure of a peptide, but also adds a positive charge within the ring and can serve as a constrained mimic of arginine, thereby contributing to specific protein surface interactions, as demonstrated by several co&#8208;crystal structures with proteins of interest.







Abstract
Peptide stapling has emerged as a versatile approach in drug discovery to reinforce secondary structure elements especially &#945;&#8208;helices and improve properties of linear bioactive peptides. Inspired by the prevalence of arginine in protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;DNA interfaces, we investigated guanidinium&#8208;stapling as a means to constrain helical peptides. Guanidinium stapling was readily achieved on solid support, utilizing two orthogonally protected lysine or unatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with an amino function. This method allows for easy modulation of the nature and size of the staple as well as helix propensity. Evaluating a set of guanidinium&#8208;stapled peptides for their interaction with different protein targets identified several binders with increased target affinity. X&#8208;ray structure determination of four complexes revealed that all stapled peptides adopt a helical conformation upon protein binding. Notably, the disubstituted guanidinium generally exhibits a distinct cis/trans conformation and, in one instance, retains a conserved hydrogen bond with the protein surface. By identifying, for the first time, the guanidinium moiety as an effective helical peptide stapling group, this research significantly expands the repertoire of &#945;&#8208;helix stapling techniques for the creation of useful protein mimics.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Thermoplastics Towards Thermosets Based on Dynamic Dimethylglyoxime&#8208;Urethane Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current strategies for recycling thermoplastic polymer waste are economically unattractive and/or degenerative in the mechanical properties. Herein, we propose an economic strategy that can be used to reversibly transform the linear polymer waste towards crosslinked materials with reinforced mechanical properties.







Abstract
Huge annual consumption of thermoplastics results in the generation of large amounts of waste after their service life. Currently, the most popular recycling method based on mechanically melt&#8208;reprocessing deteriorates the material performance and is economically unattractive, which makes it unviable to be implemented in large scale. Herein, we present a chemical upcycling strategy that can transform dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane based thermoplastic waste into thermoset product with superior mechanical properties and higher economic values than the initial one. It is found that the dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety has dynamic nature, endowing the material with open&#8208;loop upcycling ability. By removing the dimethylglyoxime segment via a simple sublimation process, the material structure is transformed from linear molecular into crosslinked network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.

         <title>Optical Control of TRPM8 Channels with Photoswitchable Menthol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM), the first photoswitchable activator of the TRPM8 channel. AzoM enables precise and reversible optical control of TRPM8, facilitating detailed analysis of current kinetics. This allows for deeper insights into the specific roles of individual amino acids in channel gating, AzoM binding, and phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2) binding and sensitization.







Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels are well known as sensors for cold temperatures and cooling agents such as menthol and icilin and these channels are tightly regulated by the membrane lipid phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2). Since TRPM8 channels emerged as promising drug targets for treating pain, itching, obesity, cancer, dry eye disease, and inflammation, we aimed at developing a high&#8208;precision TRPM8 channel activator, to achieve spatiotemporal control of TRPM8 activity with light. In this study, we designed, synthesized and characterized the first photoswitchable TRPM8 activator azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM). AzoM enables optical control of endogenously and heterologously expressed TRPM8 channels with UV and blue light which is demonstrated by performing patch&#8208;clamp experiments. Moreover, AzoM facilitates the reliable determination of activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics thereby providing further insights into the channel gating. Using AzoM, the specific roles of individual amino acids for AzoM or PIP2 binding and for sensitization by PIP2 can be elucidated. Altogether, AzoM represents as a high&#8208;precision pharmaceutical tool for reversible control of TRPM8 channel function that enhances our biophysical understanding of TRPM8 channels and holds the potential to support the development of novel pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) can be utilized for electroenzymatic hydrogen production under ambient conditions and neutral pH. Mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have a hierarchical morphology with cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates, enhancing the electroenzymatic performance CpI.







Abstract
The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability and current densities of 8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and adsorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.

         <title>Polymer Films&#8217; Residual Stress Attenuation from the Supramolecular Complexation with Ultra&#8208;Small Nanoparticles for High Resolution Nanoimprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles can significantly alter the dynamics and physicochemical properties of polymers compared to colloid NPs due to their comparable sizes with characteristic lengths of polymer chain segment and the dense supramolecular interaction with polymers. This effect facilitates the fabrication of residual stress&#8208;free polymer films with high mechanical strengths, enabling unique application for low&#8208;cost, sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution NIL.







Abstract
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been broadly applied in the fabrication of nano&#8208;patterned polymer films for cost&#8208;efficiency and high through&#8208;put; however, the intrinsic tradeoff between mechanical strength and residual stress of polymer films significantly limits the NIL resolution while the harsh processing conditions limit its versatile applications to different substrates. Herein, 1&#8197;nm metal oxide cluster, phosphotungstic acid (PTA), is used to complex with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for high&#8208;resolution NIL that can be operated at large&#8208;scale and mild conditions. The ultra&#8208;small size of PTA enables dense supramolecular interaction with PVA for the diminished crystallinity and accelerated chain dynamics that help relax the residual stress during film casting. Meanwhile, the PTAs serve as supramolecular crosslinkers for the increased modulus of the films (ca. 2&#8197;GPa), providing promising dimensional stability required for high&#8208;resolution NIL. Simple casting the aqueous blend on a master mold successfully gives a residual stress&#8208;free film with sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution at wafer scale (&gt;100&#8197;cm2). The mild processing at ambient condition permits broad NIL applications to diverse substrates, e.g., integrated circuit chips, compact discs, PET nano gratings and even delicate bio&#8208;surfaces.

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrakisporphyrins with amino acid side chains adopt pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic conformations maintained by antiparallel hydrogen bonding. The (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configurations of the stereogenic centers direct the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations direct the left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helical supramolecular pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers, respectively.







Abstract
Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6&#8197;nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination Enhanced Metallopolymer Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally novel polymer crosslinked by metal&#8211;organic coordination units (defined as metallopolymer) is designed and prepared to develop high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolytes (MPEs). By exploiting a Mo paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker, the organic and inorganic moieties of polymer skeleton are integrated at molecular level, without phase separation and local inhomogeneity. The coordinatively unsaturated Mo&#8801;Mo units in Mo(II) paddle wheel complexes can serve as Lewis acid sites to effectively bind to bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;), increase Li+ flux, and facilitate FSI&#8722; decomposition, resulting in uniform Li+ concentration gradients and the formation of stable fluorinated interfaces.







Abstract
The practical application of polymer electrolytes is seriously hindered by the inferior Li+ ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number (tLi+), and poor interfacial stability. Herein, a structurally novel metallopolymer is designed and synthesized by exploiting a molybdenum (Mo) paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker to bridge organic and inorganic moieties at molecular level. The prepared metallopolymer possesses combined merits of outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, as well as a low glass transition temperature (Tg &lt;&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C). Based on this metallopolymer, an advanced metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolyte (MPE) is developed for constructing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the unsaturated coordination of Mo atoms, the uniformly distributed Mo&#8208;polyoxometalates (Mo&#8208;POMs) in metallopolymer skeleton can effectively immobilize anions (bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions, FSI&#8722;) and promote the dissociation of Li salts. Moreover, dynamic metal&#8211;organic coordination bonds endow the MPE with re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing, enabling it to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. Consequently, the MPE achieves a competitive ionic conductivity of 0.712&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C), a high tLi+ (0.625), and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.0&#8197;V). This study presents a unique MPE design based on metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced strategy, providing a promising solution for developing wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Unconventional Phase Metal Heteronanostructures for Higher&#8208;Rate Stable Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theory&#8208;guided design is proposed to promote the rational synthesis of unconventional phase 4H/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) ruthenium&#8208;nickel heteronanostructures as efficient bifunctional catalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2/air batteries. The assembled Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;air cells with unconventional phase metal heteronanostructures deliver excellent rate performance and cycling stability via tuning the discharge reaction path from Li2CO3 to Li2C2O4 at high rates.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) and Li&#8208;air batteries hold great potential in achieving carbon neutral given their ultrahigh theoretical energy density and eco&#8208;friendly features. However, these Li&#8208;gas batteries still suffer from low discharging&#8208;charging rate and poor cycling life due to sluggish decomposition kinetics of discharge products especially Li2CO3. Here we report the theory&#8208;guided design and preparation of unconventional phase metal heteronanostructures as cathode catalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2/air batteries. The assembled Li&#8208;CO2 cells with unconventional phase 4H/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) ruthenium&#8208;nickel heteronanostructures deliver a narrow discharge&#8208;charge gap of 0.65&#8197;V, excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 200 cycles at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The constructed Li&#8208;air batteries can steadily run for above 150 cycles in ambient air. Electrochemical mechanism studies reveal that 4H/fcc Ru&#8722;Ni with high&#8208;electroactivity facets can boost redox reaction kinetics and tune discharge reactions towards Li2C2O4 path, alleviating electrolyte/catalyst failures induced by the aggressive singlet oxygen from solo decomposition of Li2CO3.

         <title>Performance and Stability of Corundum&#8208;type In2O3 Catalyst for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhombohedral polymorph of indium oxide performs better than the cubic one in terms of yield, selectivity, and stability for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. The catalyst stability and sequence of transformation from rhombohedral to cubic to metallic indium is revealed in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol is a key chemical reaction to store energy in chemical bonds, using carbon dioxide as an energy sink. Indium oxide is amongst the most promising candidates for replacing the copper and zinc oxide catalyst, which is industrially applied for syngas mixtures but less idoneous for educts with carbon dioxide due to instability reasons. The polymorph of indium oxide and the operating conditions remain to be optimized for optimal and stable performance. Indium oxide catalysts containing different rhombohedral and cubic phase ratios were synthesized using a solvothermal method and evaluated in an ideally mixed gas phase reactor. The pure rhombohedral catalyst shows the best performance in terms of yield to methanol, selectivity, and stability. The phase stability was assessed using synchrotron in situ XRD and Rietveld refinement, shedding light on the stability of the different phases at extended operating conditions. Depending on the flow rate, temperature, and hydrogen partial pressure, a rhombohedral to cubic transition occurs, ultimately yielding inactive metallic indium. If present, cubic In2O3 serves as nuclei to induce the cubic to rhombohedral transition, hampering performance. These results allow for a more rational catalyst design and fine&#8208;tuning of the operating conditions to ensure optimal and stable performance.

         <title>Modulating the Band Structure of Two&#8208;Dimensional Black Phosphorus via Electronic Effects of Organic Functional Groups for Enhanced Hydrogen Production Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that organic functional groups can modulate the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP). By modifying BP&#8242;s surface, these groups alter charge density and shift band&#8208;edge positions, enabling continuous tuning of BP's valence and conduction bands. This approach achieves high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light, offering a flexible, cost&#8208;effective strategy for enhancing BP&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP's band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective dehydrogenative aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl groups on Au(111) surfaces has been achieved, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene. The transformation, involving sequential C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation at C1 and C6, is confirmed by scanning probe microscopies and DFT calculations and is applicable to heteroatom&#8208;containing precursors.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8722;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).

Abstract
Efficient removal of acetylene (C2H2) impurities from polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) in a simple, clean manner remains a challenging goal in industry. The use of porous materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is promising for this aim but the acquisition of high purification performance is still hindered by few knowledge on the purification process because the previous conclusions were derived basically from the non&#8208;breakthrough tests or ignored the influence of structural difference (crystal structure, morphology, or defect). Here we propose an unprecedented in situ stimulus response strategy to minimize the influence of structural difference, obtain the gas&#8208;loading crystal structures of the same MOF before and after light or heat stimulation, directly observe the evolution of pore charge distribution and pore&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;gas interactions under light/heat induction, and finally summarizes the favorable structure for highly efficient purification of C2H4. This study opens a new route to understand the relationship between the structure and separation performance for porous materials.

         <title>A Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis approach was employed to fabricate a homochiral covalent organic framework (COF) utilizing a well&#8208;defined chiral amine precursor. The resulting membrane exhibited exceptional enantioselectivity for racemic phenylalanine due to the uniform distribution of chiral recognition sites and a high degree of size matching between the chiral centers and the target molecule. This resulted in an enantiomeric excess value reaching 99.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4&#8201;%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.

         <title>Atomically Asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8211;Co Sites Enable Efficient Chloride&#8208;Mediated Ethylene Electrooxidation in Neutral Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ir&#8208;substituted Co3O4 with an Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration (Ir1/Co3O4) was reported for the chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) in neutral seawater. The unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect accelerates electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain structural stability, leading to high activity and stability for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR.







Abstract
The chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) via electrocatalysis is practically attractive because of its sustainability and mild reaction conditions. However, the chlorine oxidation reaction (COR), which is essential for the above process, is commonly catalyzed by dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) with high contents of precious Ru and/or Ir. The development of highly efficient COR electrocatalysts composed of nonprecious metals or decreased amounts of precious metals is highly desirable. Herein, we report a modified Co3O4 with a single&#8208;atom Ir substitution (Ir1/Co3O4) as a highly efficient COR electrocatalyst for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR to ECH in neutral seawater. Ir1/Co3O4 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 94.8&#8201;% for ECH generation and remarkable stability. Combining experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect in Ir1/Co3O4 can accelerate electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain the structural stability of Co3O4 during COR. Moreover, a coupling reaction system integrating the anodic chloride&#8208;mediated and cathodic H2O2&#8208;mediated EOR show a total FE of ~170&#8201;% for paired electrosynthesis of ECH and ethylene glycol (EG) using ethylene as the raw material. The technoeconomic analysis highlights the promising application prospects of this system.

Vacancy engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets were developed as highly efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for the diverse functionalization of electronic&#8208;rich alkenes.







Abstract
Engineered polymeric carbon nitride represents a promising class of metal&#8208;free semiconductor photocatalysts for organic synthesis. Herein, we utilized engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets, which exhibit an increased specific surface area and band gap due to enhanced quantum confinement from vacancy enrichment. These nanosheets serve as a heterogeneous organic semiconductor photocatalyst to facilitate diverse functionalizations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes, including arylsulfonylation, aminodifluoroalkylation, and oxytrifluoromethylation. This catalytic system operates under mild conditions, offering excellent functional group compatibility and high yields. Additionally, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding recyclability and efficiency in flow reactors, highlighting its significant potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;encapsulated enzymes are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, ultrasensitive activity analysis of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). We demonstrate that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated, which exhibits high accuracy for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.







Abstract
Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we demonstrate a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n=63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92&#8201;%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A band structure regulation strategy is proposed to design a HER&#8208;suppressed MnP alloy anode for aqueous Mn metal batteries, where the severe HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the high HOMO energy level and low electron escape work function of metallic Mn. Therefore, the MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 could deliver an extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation (88.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8722;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries

         <title>Selective Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report highly effective iridium&#8208;catalyzed methods for the installation of hydrogen isotopes into pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant sulfoximine&#8208;containing structures that can be conducted selectively via exchange at C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8208;centers. The utility of this catalytic platform has also been demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage and single step generation of labelled bioactive architectures and biomolecules.







Abstract
Pharmaceutical&#8208;aligned research endeavors continue to diversify, including via the installation of new chemical functionality and non&#8208;classical bioisosteres within drug design. With this, an equally high demand emerges for the direct installation of isotopic substituents into these scaffolds within drug discovery programmes, as isotopologues are essential for the elucidation of the biological efficacy and metabolic fate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The sulfoximine functional group has recently become established as a high&#8208;value unit in this context; however, general and effective methods for the synthesis of deuterium (2H, D) and tritium (3H, T) labelled analogues have remained elusive. Herein, we disclose the design and development of the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed sulfoximine&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) systems that permit the site&#8208;selective integration of a distinguishing atomic label at aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H and more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H moieties. Moreover, we exemplify the broad applicability of these methods within a spectrum of molecular settings, as well as in the late&#8208;stage generation of isotopically&#8208;enriched complex bioactive architectures.

         <title>Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; shows that the {Zn(hmds)} 12&#8208;electron fragment is perfectly suited for stabilizing a heretofore only theoretically predicted boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit. Comprehensive DFT calculations corroborate that fine&#8208;tuning of the charge and shape of {Bi6} moieties in heterometallic clusters are responsive to the nature of (electron&#8208;withdrawing) transition metal complex fragments coordinated by this unit.







Abstract
Molecules based on polyatomic bismuth substructures are currently attracting a lot of attention owing to this heavy and essentially non&#8208;toxic element's uncommon chemical and physical properties, which include unprecedented bonding properties. Hexaatomic {Bi6} substructures that underly more complex cluster structures were recently reported to adopt different structures or exhibit different structural details as a consequence of the charge of the {Bi6} unit. This leads to either crown&#8208;shaped cycles for a nominal Bi66&#8722; or differently distorted trigonal prisms for compositions close to Bi62&#8722;. It was predicted by quantum chemistry that Bi64&#8722; should adopt a distinctly distorted boat&#8208;like shape, yet a corresponding compound has remained elusive. Here, we report a proof of this assumption by the synthesis of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]2[Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5THF (1), comprising a bimetallic [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; cluster that fulfills the prediction for the geometric and electronic structure of the missing link (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[8.8.8]hexa&#8208;cosane, hmds=hexamethyldisilazanid). A detailed quantum chemical study shows how the nature of Lewis&#8208;acidic transition metal complexes&#8212;in particular, 12&#8208;electron fragments&#8212;control and fine&#8208;tune the resulting {Bi6} architectures in accordance with the degree of electron&#8208;withdrawal from the polybismuthide core.

         <title>Autocatalysis&#8208;Integrated Bioorthogonal (Poly)Catalyst&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Living Cell Membrane Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an autocatalysis&#8208;enhanced bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA). The method attaches polymer&#8208;based tris(triazolylmethyl)amine copper complex, catalyst of Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), to an antibody. Polytriazoles formed in the CuAAC reaction chelate Cu(I), speeding catalysis and boosting signal amplification. This technique effectively images live cell membrane antigens.







Abstract
Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which involves coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I), thereby promoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both in vitro and living cell membranes. This approach offers a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of intermolecular polarity in metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction is highlighted in this study. By rationally modulating the core&#8216;s polarity of pyridine&#8208;containing imine&#8208;like COFs, we achieved 93.1&#8201;% selectivity and 90.5&#8201;% faradic efficiency for H2O2 production. This study paved the way for designing efficient and selective electrochemical H2O2 production catalysts.







Abstract
Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 at 0.4&#8197;V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5&#8201;%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H2O2 generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.

         <title>Precise Photochemical Post&#8208;Processing of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>

We report a method to fabricate molecular crystals of desired size and aspect ratio that capitalizes on their photochemical reactivity. The resulting crystals retain their physical properties and can be used to transduce light, among other applications requiring aspect ratios that are currently unavailable by crystallization approaches.







Abstract
Molecular crystals carry a great potential as new soft smart materials, with a plethora of recent examples overcoming the major obstacle of mechanical flexibility, and this research direction holds enormous potential to revolutionize optics, electronics, medicine, and space exploration. However, shaping organic crystals into desired shapes and sizes remains a major practical challenge due to the lack of control over the crystallization process, and the difficulties in mechanical post&#8208;processing without introduction of defects that are usually imparted by their soft nature. Here we present an innovative approach that employs photochemical processing for precise and nondestructive cutting of a molecular crystal. Our proposed method uses light to post&#8208;process crystals of the desired size and shape, similar to using light to cut other materials. This reaction induces strain, ensuring sharp cleavage without the need for melting or other processes. We further demonstrate the potential of this approach by producing crystals of arbitrary size, which can be used as controllable optical waveguides. Among other potential applications, this method can be used to prepare dynamic crystals, particularly those with aspect ratios crucial for mechanical deformation, such as flexible electronics, soft robotics, and sensing.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. It employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as the limiting reagent and presumably involves the formation of a reactive Fe&#8208;nitrene/imidyl radical species. This operationally simple method is amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and APIs.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are privileged structures in both marketed drugs and natural products. On the other hand, C&#8722;H amination reactions furnish unconventional and straightforward approaches for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. Yet, most of the known methods rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles, catalyzed by inexpensive FeCl2, which allows the functionalization of a wide range of pharmaceutically relevant cyclic amines. The C&#8722;H amination occurs site&#8208;selectively in &#945;&#8208;position to the nitrogen atom, even when weaker C&#8722;H bonds are present, and furnishes Troc&#8208;protected aminals or amidines. The method employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as limiting reagent and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Its synthetic potential was further illustrated through the derivatization of &#945;&#8208;aminated products and the application to a concise total synthesis of the reported structure for senobtusin. Mechanistic studies allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism involving a turnover&#8208;limiting Fe&#8208;nitrene generation followed by fast H atom transfer and radical rebound.

         <title>Triplet Energy Gap&#8208;Regulated Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) is introduced to construct the organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Here, the guest's triplet state can act as the &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;. A bidirectional energy transfer process, triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (rTTET) process, has proved in host&#8211;guest doped system. When &#916;ET is large, guest's triplet state collects the triplet excitons to emit RTP but returns triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small.







Abstract
The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8211;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8211;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8211;guest doped materials, using benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest's triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra, and theoretical calculations, a bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host&#8211;guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.

         <dc:description>
The first evidence of a macrocyclic effect for halenium (X+) ions is reported. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate the selective endotopic complexation of Br(I) species, remarkably facilitating the isolation of a stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; analogue and the first report of chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes. XRD studies of the macrocyclic Br(I) complexes and Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provide rare insight concerning halenium vs. metal cation coordination behaviors.







Abstract
Halenium ions (X+) are highly reactive electron deficient species that are prevalent transient intermediates in halogenation reactions. The stabilisation of these species is especially challenging, with the most common approach to sequester reactivity through the formation of bis&#8208;pyridine (Py) complexes; [(Py)2X]+. Herein, we present the first example of a macrocyclic stabilisation effect for halenium species. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate that preorganised macrocyclic ligands stabilise bromenium cations via endotopic complexation, impressively facilitating the isolation of a bench stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; species. Solid state X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural comparison of macrocyclic Br(I) complexes with Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provides insightful information concerning similarities and stark contrasts in halenium/metal cation coordination behaviors. Furthermore, the first chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes are reported between acyclic [(Py)2Br]+ species and a bis&#8208;pyridine macrocyclic donor ligand which importantly highlights a macrocycle effect for halenium cation stabilisation in the solution phase.

         <title>Surface Coordination Chemistry of Graphitic Carbon Nitride from Ag Molecular Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) is functionalized with organosilver probe molecules through a Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach. In&#8208;depth characterization using high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS), and solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy reveal the dynamic processes during metal grafting to generate three distinct surface sites: bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ag+, dispersed Ag+ sites, and physisorbed molecular precursor.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has gained significant attention for its catalytic properties, especially in the development of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs). However, the surface chemistry underlying the formation of these isolated metal sites remains poorly understood. In this study we employ Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) together with advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques for an in&#8208;depth analysis of functionalized g&#8208;C3N4 materials, where tailored organosilver probe molecules are used to monitor surface processes and characterize resulting surface species. A multi&#8208;technique approach &#8211; including high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and multinuclear solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR), coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations &#8211; identifies three primary surface species in Ag&#8208;functionalized g&#8208;C3N4: bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ag+, dispersed Ag+ sites, and physisorbed molecular precursor. These findings highlight a dynamic grafting process and provide insights into the surface coordination chemistry of functionalized g&#8208;C3N4 materials.

         <title>Tailoring d&#8208;Band Center of Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Sites for Boosted Photocatalytic Reduction of Diluted CO2 from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via coordination engineering of single&#8208;atom Ni sites in conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CMOFs), Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs features active sites of higher oxidation state and closer lying of d&#8208;band centers to the Fermi level than its Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs counterpart, which favors the generation of *COOH key intermediate and the desorption of *CO, jointly resulting in significantly boosted performance for photoreduction of anthropogenic diluted CO2 from flue gas.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of diluted CO2 from anthropogenic sources holds tremendous potential for achieving carbon neutrality, while the huge barrier to forming *COOH key intermediate considerably limits catalytic effectiveness. Herein, via coordination engineering of atomically scattered Ni sites in conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CMOFs), we propose a facile strategy for tailoring the d&#8208;band center of metal active sites towards high&#8208;efficiency photoreduction of diluted CO2. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in pure CO2, CMOFs with Ni&#8208;O4 sites (Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs) exhibits an outstanding rate for CO generation of 13.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 94.5&#8201;%, which is almost double that of its isostructural counterpart with traditional Ni&#8208;N4 sites (Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs), outperforming most reported systems under comparable conditions. Interestingly, in simulated flue gas, the CO selectivity of Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs decreases significantly while that of Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs is mostly unchanged, signifying the supremacy for Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs in leveraging anthropogenic diluted CO2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) investigations demonstrate that O coordination can move the center of the Ni sites&#8242; d&#8208;band closer to the Fermi level, benefiting the generation of *COOH key intermediate as well as the desorption of *CO and hence leading to significantly boosted activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.

         <title>Interweavable Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Fibers for Indirect Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mechanically robust metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers have been fabricated through an in situ polymerization strategy. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be readily processed into different fiber forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or interweaved networks that can be applied in efficient indirect electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The applications of indirect electrocatalysis toward potential industrial processes are drastically limited by the utilization or processing forms of electrocatalysts. The remaining challenges of electrocatalysts like the recycling in homogeneous systems or pulverization in heterogeneous systems call for advanced processing forms to meet the desired requirements. Here, we report a series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers (M&#8722;PF, M=Ni, Cu and Zn) through a rigid&#8208;flexible polymerization strategy based on rigid metalloporphyrin and flexible thiourea units that can be applied as heterogeneous redox&#8208;mediators in indirect electrocatalysis. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be processed into different fiber&#8208;forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or even interweaved networks. Interestingly, they can be readily applied in S&#8722;S bond cleaving/cyclization reaction or extended oxidative self&#8208;coupling reaction of thiols with high efficiency. Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (1.25&#8197;g in a batch&#8208;experiment) under laboratory conditions.

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and long&#8208;lifespan up to 178&#8197;cycles are achieved for lithium metal batteries just via using a three&#8208;component additive formula. The modifying electrolyte not only enhances the ionic conductivity significantly but also forms robust interfacial films on both electrodes, effectively suppressing electrolyte decomposition. Moreover, it ensures long&#8208;lasting and uniform Li+ regulation, contributing to exceptional cycle stability even under high voltage up to 5.0&#8197;V.







Abstract
Matching high&#8208;voltage cathodes with lithium metal anodes represents the most viable technological approach for developing secondary batteries with ultra&#8208;high energy density exceeding 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Nevertheless, the instability of electrolyte/electrode interface film and commercial electrolytes with cut&#8208;off voltage above 4.3&#8197;V is still a major concern. Herein, we present that excellent cycling stability with an ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 5.0&#8197;V can be obtained by using three&#8208;component additives containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB). Excellent ionic conductivity, robust interfacial films on both electrodes, and long&#8208;lasting uniform Li+ regulation ability can be obtained in the modifying electrolyte. Consequently, using a high plating/stripping capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lithium symmetric cells demonstrate stable cycling performance exceeding 800&#8197;hours. Meanwhile, the 7.3&#8197;Ah&#8208;class Li[NixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;y]O2 (x=0.83, NCM83)|Li pouch cells are assembled, which show a high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and present excellent stability over 178&#8197;cycles with a high initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.0&#8201;%.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Coupled Supramolecular System Accelerates Photophosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP energy synthesis is achieved by constructing the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4/ATP synthase hydrogel. G&#8208;C3N4 as photocatalyst can be entrapped in the dipeptide Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel to catalyze and provide protons under light. Fmoc&#8208;FF can cooperate with g&#8208;C3N4 and contribute to the dispersion of catalysts to facilitate transmembrane proton gradient to drive ATP synthase located outside of the hydrogel for accelerated photophosphorylation.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly allows multiple chemical/bio&#8208;components integrated as one system for cascade biochemical reactions. Herein the graphitic carbon nitrides (g&#8208;C3N4) as photocatalyst trapped in a dipeptide hydrogel covering adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase accelerates the photophosphorylation through ATP synthesis. Self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) as nanofibrils to allow g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are embedded as a complex Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel. Fmoc&#8208;FF gel exhibits good electronic coupling with g&#8208;C3N4, which enables a photo&#8208;induced proton generation. The transmembrane proton gradient can be established by ATP synthase&#8208;lipid reconstituted on the surface of the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel to enhance the ATP synthesis. It indicates that the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4/ATP synthase&#8208;lipid film can possess a longer&#8208;term ATP production capability and allow repeated immersion for sustained ATP production. Such a hydrogel&#8208;supported ATP synthesis platform is achieved by a procedure at a larger scale.

         <title>Targeting Lysosomal Thiols for Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described reversible thiol binder 11, which accumulates in lysosomes of cancer cells, increases the level of ROS leading to their disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner model, 11 extends the lifespan of the mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.







Abstract
The number and stability of lysosomes (LYs) are different in cancer and healthy cells that makes them a possible target for cancer specific therapy. However, no LY&#8208;targeting drug is clinically approved yet. We describe in this paper a new therapeutic approach based on alkylation of lysosomal thiols in cancer cells by reversible thiol binder 11. The treatment with 11 increases the level of lysosomal reactive oxygen species leading to their destabilization, disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. These effects are not observed in healthy cells. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner (NK)/Ly&#8208;RB model, 11 exhibits the spectacular therapeutic effect: it extends the lifespan of the treated mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. The survived mice develop antibodies against tumor NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells. Their repeated challenge with the NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells results in 100&#8201;% mice survival compared to 0&#8201;% survival in the control group of na&#239;ve mice. Ex vivo data indicate that neutrophils in spleen of the cured animals are also involved in targeting cancer cells and produce neutrophil extracellular traps. In summary, 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared a regulated ZIF membrane with reduced defect density owing to the confined growth of crystals between the top layer and substrate. Such a membrane provides a superior H2/N2 separation selectivity.







Abstract
The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99&#8201;% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353&#8201;% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI), composed of synthetic cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids, can overcome the mechanical immune checkpoint by stiffening the tumor cells for enhanced tumor suppression. MICI fuses CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane to deplete the cholesterol from the plasma membrane, thereby improving NK and T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor effects.

Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.

A pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) grafted to carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. This process significantly facilitates the 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; WOR. Moreover, anthraquinone units with strong proton extraction capacity boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. In a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor, the generated H2O2 can be efficiently activated into &#8901;OH radicals, enabling the rapid degradation and mineralization of various organic pollutants under solar irradiation.







Abstract
On&#8208;site H2O2 activation attracts much attention in energy conversion and environment remediation et&#8197;al., yet remains challenging in its highly efficient and sustainable synthesis. Herein, we grafted a pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) in polymeric carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. Specifically, photogenerated electrons in the anthraquinone unit facilitate the 2e&#8722; ORR, while the methoxyphenyl unit, which gathers photogenerated holes, enables rapid 4e&#8722; WOR. More impressively, the anthraquinone unit also exhibits strong proton extraction capabilities to boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. Consequently, the synthesized donor&#8208;polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;acceptor (DPA) catalyst shows a remarkable H2O2 yield of 6497.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water, surpassing traditional DP and PA catalysts. Because of its high efficiency, the H2O2 product can efficiently degrade and mineralize various organic contaminants in a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor under sunlight irradiation. Our work presents an unprecedented approach to designing photocatalysts with efficient H2O2 synthesis and practical application from a molecular engineering perspective.

         <title>A Metal Chelation Therapy to Effectively Eliminate Breast Cancer and Intratumor Bacteria While Suppressing Tumor Metastasis by Copper Depletion and Zinc Ions Surge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative metal chelation therapy is proposed to inhibit the growth of tumor and intratumor F. nucleatum through copper depletion and Zn2+ surge. Meanwhile, this therapy suppresses tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the block of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum.







Abstract
The intratumor microbiota results in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an innovative metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn&#8208;PEN) by chelating the copper chelator D&#8208;Penicillamine (D&#8208;PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn&#8208;PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis metabolism in breast cancer through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn&#8208;PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn&#8208;PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn&#8208;PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal anchoring of chromophores into 0D metal&#8208;organic cages to achieve high&#8208;temperature long afterglow emission. The afterglow emission of Cd&#8208;IDB&#8208;IPA reached 600&#8197;s after turning off the 365&#8197;nm UV lamp at 77&#8197;K, and the afterglow emission was still observed after being excited by WLED at 380&#8197;K.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208;engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380&#8197;K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.

         <title>Single Atomic Cu&#8208;C3 Sites Catalyzed Interfacial Chemistry in Bi@C for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Ultrafast Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C3 sites have been innovatively designed by the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. The Cu&#8211;C3 sites can serve as both a modulator to catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase and a promoter to facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na+, which endow the sample with high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage performance.







Abstract
Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8722;C3 site (Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8722;C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8722;F and C&#8722;O bonds in NaPF6&#8208;ether&#8208;based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8722;C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in&#8208;plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C achieves a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling durability. The as&#8208;constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to an energy density of 265&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new strategy to realize high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage for alloy&#8208;based anode through constructing single&#8208;atom modulator integrated catalysis and promotion effect into one entity.

&lt;p&gt;Single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites have been innovatively designed by the simple pyrolysis of metal-organic framework. The Cu&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites can serve as both a modulator to catalyze the formation of inorganic-rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase and a promoter to facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which endow the sample with high-efficient sodium ion storage performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode-electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; site (Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal-organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8722;F and C&#8722;O bonds in NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-ether-based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic-rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in-plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and reduces the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration energy barrier.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Ionic Conductivity in Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible, All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Operating at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries capable of operating at room temperature have been successfully constructed based on the photoexcitation modulation mechanism of heterojunctions fillers as well as the natural bacterial cellulose possessing excellent mechanical property and PEO compatibility. These innovations enable the lithium&#8208;metal pouch cell to achieve a high discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending/folding, while maintaining superior cycling stability at a 1 C rate (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Designing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity for room&#8208;temperature operation is essential for advancing flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state energy storage devices. Innovative strategies are urgently required to develop SPEs that are safe, stable, and high&#8208;performing. In this work, we introduce photoexcitation&#8208;modulated heterojunctions as catalytically active fillers within SPEs, guided by photocatalytic design principles, and meanwhile employ natural bacterial cellulose to improve the compatibility with poly(ethylene oxide), improve the coordination environment of lithium salts, and optimize both ion transport and mechanical properties. In situ photothermal experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong photogenerated electric field produced by trace heterojunctions within poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes under photoexcitation significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation, increasing the concentration of mobile Li+. This results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.135&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, with a Li+ transference number as high as 0.46. The flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal pouch cells exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 178.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending and folding, and demonstrate exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 86.7&#8201;% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles at 1&#8197;C (25&#8201;&#176;C). This research offers a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Elucidating Confinement and Microenvironment of Ru Clusters Stably Confined in MFI Zeolite for Efficient Propane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal in situ ligand protection combined with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere has been effectively utilized to encapsulate Ru clusters within MFI zeolites. The interaction between the confined Ru clusters and the MFI framework induces local strain, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment. This synergistic interaction demonstrates exceptional activity and unparalleled stability in the deep oxidation of propane.







Abstract
Achieving active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulating noble metal species within zeolites is highly promising for high utilization and cost efficiency in thermal and environmental catalytic reactions. Ru, considered an economical noble metal alternative with comparable performance, faces great challenges within MFI&#8208;type microporous zeolites due to its high cohesive energy and mobility. Herein, an innovative strategy was explored that couples hydrothermal in situ ligand protection with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere to embed ultrasmall Ru clusters anchored at K+&#8208;healed silanol sites (&#8801;Si&#8722;Ru&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;K complexes) within 10&#8208;membered ring sinusoidal channels of MFI. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the interplay between confined Ru clusters and MFI induces local strain in MFI, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment around the Ru clusters. This synergy interaction enhances alkane deep oxidation as the confined Ru clusters and the MFI microenvironment collectively pre&#8208;activate C3H8 and O2, facilitate the cleavage of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds at low temperatures. Notably, the stable geometric and electronic properties of the confined Ru show exceptional thermal stability up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, rivaling fresh catalysts. These findings shed vital methodological and mechanistic insights for developing efficacious heterogeneous catalysts for thermal catalysis.

The incorporation of multiple payloads within the same scaffold is a growing tendency in last generation Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). This paper reports the first strategy for the quadruple functionalization of therapeutic antibodies using four unique functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This is possible from multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies that result in highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody with retained affinity for the target.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well&#8208;defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.







Abstract
Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios.

     alt="Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve-Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well-defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low-strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi-crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain-induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy-dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape-memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve-release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength-toughness trade-off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
HxWO3 as a reversible hydrogen acceptor&#8208;donor is partnered with Cu to enable a relay mechanism for NITRR operated at E &gt;0 vs. RHE, which contains rapid H intercalation into HxWO3, prompt H de&#8208;intercalation from HxWO3 and transfer onto Cu and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production without competitive hydrogen evolution was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution. To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at 0.10&#8197;V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8722;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric carbene insertion into the Se&#8722;S bond of PhSeSCN under synergistic catalysis by a dirhodium salt and a chiral guanidine is reported. Various selenylthiocyanatopropanoates were prepared in good yields and enantioselectivity and exhibited excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory activity against IL&#8208;1&#946;. A new chalcogen&#8208;bond activation mode is disclosed.







Abstract
The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selenyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8722;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selenylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a mechanocatalytic route for upcycling polyethylene (PE) into high&#8208;purity hydrogen gas (H2, 99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) and metal carbides using ball milling at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Manganese (Mn) catalysts enable a remarkable H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;%. The resulting carbides, which do not promote hydrocarbons formation, further enhance H2 recovery ratio. This method provides an efficient pathway for converting PE to high&#8208;purity H2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75&#8197;vol&#8201;% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;% (versus 15.7&#8201;% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Ethylene Glycol Oxidization Coupled with Hydrogen Generation Using Metal Oxide Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), achieving a faradic efficiency for formate production exceeding 85&#8201;% along with long&#8208;term stability. Additionally, we constructed an unassisted PEC tandem device that simultaneously facilitates EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a Cu2O photocathode.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents a promising approach for harnessing solar energy and transforming it into storable hydrogen. However, the complicated 4&#8208;electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm2. Our research not only offers a PEC pathway for converting PET plastics into valuable chemicals but also enables simultaneous hydrogen production.

However, the complicated 4-electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanode with a state-of-the-art Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our research not only offers a PEC pathway for converting PET plastics into valuable chemicals but also enables simultaneous hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver&#8211;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8211;carbon coordination&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, which possess narrow band gaps down to 1.42&#8197;eV and well&#8208;defined crystalline two&#8208;dimensional staggered AB stacking structures, are rationally synthesized. The strong&#8208;polarized isocyanide groups not only provide a quasi&#8208;linear C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C coordination environment but also act as active carbon site for electrochemical catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied due to their versatile applications and easily tunable structures. However, heteroatom&#8208;metal coordination dominates the MOFs community, and the rational synthesis of carbon&#8211;metal coordination&#8208;based MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs based on silver&#8211;carbon linkages are synthesized through the coordination between silver(I) salt and isocyanide&#8208;based monomers at ambient condition. The as&#8208;synthesized 2D MOFs possess well&#8208;defined crystalline structures and a staggered AB stacking mode. Most interestingly, these 2D MOFs, without &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between layers, exhibit narrow band gaps down to 1.42&#8197;eV. As electrochemical catalysts for converting CO2 to CO, such 2D MOFs demonstrate Faradaic efficiency over 92&#8201;%. Surprisingly, the CO2 reduction catalyzed by these MOFs indicates favorable adsorption of CO2 and *COOH on the active carbon sites of the isocyanide groups rather than on silver sites. This is attributed to the critical &#963; donor role of isocyanides and the corresponding ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8211;transfer effect. This work not only paves the way toward a new family of MOFs based on metal&#8211;isocyanide coordination but also offers a rare platform for understanding the electrocatalysis processes on strongly polarized carbon species.

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the ligand desymmetrization approach, a flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed to construct four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators.







Abstract
The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74&#8201;% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach utilizing Suzuki coupling has led to the synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles with Figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Their enantiomers exhibited impressive dissymmetry factors and high circularly polarized luminescence brightness, with |gabs| values up to 0.033, |glum| up to 0.038, and brightness reaching 710.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum|=3.8&#215;10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL=710.5&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.

Homogeneous distribution and ordered molecular orientation of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses. The novel graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with perfect hexagonal symmetry was successfully prepared to obtain low loss interface and high crystallization of perovskite film, which delivering an impressive high PCE of 26.10&#8201;% and enhanced operational stability.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10&#8201;% under standard illumination.

         <title>Upcycling of Polyamide Wastes to Tertiary Amines Using Mo Single Atoms and Rh Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamides can be converted into tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity using Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles supported by TiO2. The described method provides an efficient way to convert polyamide waste into valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds while retaining carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable practices through the chemical recycling of polyamide wastes holds significant potential, particularly in enabling the recovery of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a novel strategy to upcycle polyamide wastes to tertiary amines with the assistance of H2 in acetic acid under mild conditions (e.g., 180&#8201;&#176;C), which is achieved over anatase TiO2 supported Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles. In this protocol, the polyamide is first converted into diacetamide intermediates via acidolysis, which are subsequently hydrogenated into corresponding carboxylic acid monomers and tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity. It is verified that Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles work together to activate both amide bonds of the diacetamide intermediate, and synergistically catalyze its hydrodeoxygenation to form tertiary amine, but this catalyst is ineffective for hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. This work presents an effective way to reconstruct various polyamide wastes into tertiary amines and carboxylic acids, which may have promising application potential.

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel electrolyte with proton transfer properties suitable for AZMBs. The Pr3+, propionic acid and montmorillonite construct connected proton transfer pathways synergistically, and the Pr3+ participates the interfacial electric double layer of manganese deposition and enhances its electrochemical activity. This water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid hybrid electrolyte could maintain cycle stability while also stimulates high specific capacity.







Abstract
Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2&#8201;% at 0.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic deoxyamination of 2&#8208;arylethanols in hexafluoroisopropanol, which directly installs various amino groups, including sulfonamides, amides, ureas and anilines. The transformation relies on the intermediacy of a phenonium ion, whose formation was rationalized by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are thus still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling 19F NMR probe disassembles upon interacting with various nucleotides in physiological conditions, activating the 19F signals and producing unique signatures for each analyte. This technique allows analysis in complex mixtures and facilitates real&#8208;time, in situ monitoring of enzymatic processes for quality control and assessment of inhibitory effects.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3&#8208;epi&#8208;Garajonone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy inspired by terpene biosynthesis culminated in the first chemical synthesis of garajonone and its epimer. The rapid construction of the carbon framework using palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions and selective redox manipulation offers a platform for the synthesis of further members of this complex family of ryanodane diterpenoids.







Abstract
Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well&#8208;known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3&#8208;epi&#8208;garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of the target molecule by employing an early&#8208;stage palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late&#8208;stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs of this complex diterpenoid family.

     alt="Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3-epi-Garajonone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-stage synthetic strategy inspired by terpene biosynthesis culminated in the first chemical synthesis of garajonone and its epimer. The rapid construction of the carbon framework using palladium-catalyzed reactions and selective redox manipulation offers a platform for the synthesis of further members of this complex family of ryanodane diterpenoids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well-known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two-stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of the target molecule by employing an early-stage palladium-catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late-stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs of this complex diterpenoid family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Deposition of organic acceptor molecules, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), on the surface of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) nanosheets causes an unprecedented 5&#8208;fold increase in the coercivity of the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite as compared to that of the bare nanosheets. This huge coercivity enhancement has been traced to the electron transfer from FGT to TCNQ that strengthens the interlayer magnetic exchange in FGT, as illustrated by Jos&#233; J. Baldov&#237;, Michael Shatruk et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202412425).

         <title>An Isolable Base&#8208;Stabilized Diazosilenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an original reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne with N2O allowing the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation. This silicon analogue of diazoalkenes exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to ligand coordination. In addition, a particular stabilizing effect of the silicon atom of diazoalkene moiety was predicted by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In contrast to the emerging chemistry of stable diazoalkenes, there are not yet any studies devoted to heavier silicon analogues, diazosilenes. Here, we report the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation 2 by the reaction of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne 1 with N2O. This silicon analog of diazoalkenes 2 exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to the coordination of phosphine and phosphine oxide ligands at the cationic silicon center. In addition, DFT calculations predict that, due to a particular stabilizing effect of the electropositive silicon atom, for diazosilenes (R2Si=C=N2), the presence of &#960;&#8208;donor substituents is not essential to prevent N2 dissociation, contrary to carbon analogues. Interestingly, diazosilenyl cation 2 tends to isomerize into (silylene)(phosphonio)diazomethane 7 via a 1,2&#8208;phosphine ligand migration and thus exhibits dual reactivity as a diazoalkene and as a diazo&#8208;substituted silylene.

X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced structural change of crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 films is investigated. Significant improvements in CO2&#8208;permeselectivity of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using an X&#8208;ray treatment method are demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
We report an X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced modification of the structure and gas permeation behavior of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. With 300&#8197;min irradiation time, CO2 permeance decreases by only 9&#8201;%, while N2 and CH4 permeances reduce by 75 and 65&#8201;%, respectively, leading to 3.7&#8208; and 2.6&#8208;fold enhancements in ideal selectivity for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>

         <dc:description>
A carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene has been synthesized by a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. The significant structural expansion resulted in a pronounced redshift in fluorescence emission as well as enhanced chemical and chiral stability.







Abstract
The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600&#8197;nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98&#215;10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitrile Derived Lithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.







Abstract
Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross&#8208;coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross&#8208;coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo&#8208;unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom&#8208;stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions.

This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds, previously challenging in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross-coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross-coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo-unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;-fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom-stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel-catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated &#945;-amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross-coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R bonds, previously challenging in transition-metal-catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;-hydride elimination.

         <title>Characterization of Iminobismuthanes and Catalytic Reduction of Organic Azides via Bi(I)/Bi(III) Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction between N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes and organic azides leads to isolation of elusive monomeric iminobismuthanes, which can be spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. This novel reactivity led to the development of a protocol for the catalytic reduction of organic azides using pinacolborane (HBpin) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized &#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212; by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.

         <title>How to Easily Depolymerize Polyurethane Foam Wastes by Superbase Catalysts in Ionic Liquids Below 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, sustainable, and scalable method for the efficient depolymerization of polyurethane foam waste is presented, employing ionic liquids and superbase catalysis as reaction media at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, and highlighting the potential for industrial application of the resulting polyol.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel and sustainable approach using Ionic Liquids (ILs) as a non&#8208;innocent solvent that enhances the performance of the basic catalysts to depolymerize polyurethane foam wastes (PUFWs) through hydrolysis, alcoholysis or aminolysis under mild conditions. The system is stable, fully recoverable, and reusable. Hydrolysis of PUFWs can occur in just 2 minutes at 95&#8211;98&#8201;&#176;C, producing a white polyol that is easily separated and reused in new polyurethane synthesis. The method was successfully scaled up to depolymerize 200 g of PUFW per batch (1 kg overall depolymerization system). This scalability, combined with the medium&#8216;s reusability without loss of effectiveness, highlights its strong potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new strategy for the C&#8722;H difunctionalization of purely aliphatic alkane substrates. The reaction proceeds with complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and enables access to a wide range of previously inaccessible acyl 9&#8208;decalinols. Additionally, the application of this method translated well to simple monocyclic alkane substrates.







Abstract
C&#8722;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.

         <title>Anomeric Amide&#8208;Enabled Alkene&#8208;Arene and Alkene&#8208;Alkene Aminative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component alkene&#8208;arene and alkene&#8208;alkene aminative coupling reaction has been developed for the synthesis of secondary amines and aziridines. This was achieved through the design, synthesis and implementation of an anomeric amide reagent, capable of promoting catalyst&#8208;free alkene chloroamination transformations, installing a formal nitrene precursor that can subsequently undergo either C&#8722;H insertion or [2+1] cycloaddition.







Abstract
Despite the prominence of C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions as a strategy to assemble molecular fragments, aminative coupling approaches, in which two fragments are assembled directly at the heteroatom, represents a rarely exploited retrosynthetic strategy. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and implementation of an anomeric amide reagent capable of promoting highly regioselective aminative alkene&#8208;arene and alkene&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This transformation follows a sequence of catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination, N&#8208;deprotection, and formal nitrene functionalization, all in one&#8208;pot. Due to the simplicity of both the protocol and the building blocks required, high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed, in combination with a full&#8208;scale scope, to rapidly and efficiently explore a wide range of chemical space and determine the limits of reactivity. In addition, alternative reactivity modes from the functionalized intermediates delivered by this protocol demonstrate the divergent nature of this aminative coupling strategy.

The structure&#8208;directing phthalocyanine assembles the supramolecular heterodimers into porous cubic crystals similar to those formed without incorporation of the porphyrin. Accessibility to both macrocycles of within the co&#8208;crystals and their reactivity are demonstrated by insitu metal insertion.







Abstract
Porphyrin&#8208;based porous materials are of growing interest as heterogeneous catalysts especially for reactions that are of importance to sustainability. Here we demonstrate that porous molecular crystals can be prepared by the simple co&#8208;crystallisation of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) with octa(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenoxy)phthalocyanine or some of its metal complexes [(dipPhO)8PcM; M=H2, Al&#8722;OH, Ti=O, Mn&#8722;Cl, Fe&#8722;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8722;Cl, Ag, In&#8722;Cl or Au&#8722;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the insitu addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area (SABET) of 454&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1. The reactivity of both macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals is demonstrated by insitu metal insertion.

         <title>Determining the Absolute Configuration of Small Molecules by Diffusion NMR Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determining the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a fundamental analytical challenge, particularly in NMR spectroscopy, where enantiomer signals are overlapped. A convenient new approach is proposed, CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent (CHIMERA), which combines chiral micelles and resolving chemical shift agents to provide a rapid solution for resolving enantiomers and determining the absolute configuration via diffusion NMR.







Abstract
Enantiomers are ubiquitous in many areas of science, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) alone is not able to differentiate enantiomers as their spectra are identical. However, these can be distinguished using chiral auxiliaries (such as chiral complexing agents) that form diastereomeric complexes, but absolute identification is still troublesome, usually requiring a chemical reaction with a chiral derivatizing agent. Here, we propose a new method that uses a hybrid mixture of solvating agents in a simple comparison of diffusion NMR experiments, which can discriminate enantiomers in both frequency and diffusion domains, dubbed CHIMERA (CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent). The new method was assessed for twenty&#8208;three small chiral molecules using a combination of BINOL and (&#8722;)&#8208;DMEB, a chiral surfactant, and initial results indicate that absolute configuration can be obtained from a simple experiment.

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thermal activation processes, anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence and delayed fluorescence bolster in crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC. The organic crystals demonstrate dual capabilities of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance. Conformational changes of the crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC molecule are identified for such properties.







Abstract
Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G&gt;0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8&#8201;%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Homoterpene Biosynthesis Widespread in Actinobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biosynthetic pathway to C16 homoterpenes in actinobacteria is reported. A novel methyltransferase family mediates methylation and double bond isomerization to produce a modified C16 precursor. Subsequent conversion by a distinct terpene cyclase family yields unprecedented homoterpenes. The findings enable the development of novel biocatalytic strategies to explore and exploit the biological and pharmaceutical effect of terpene methylations.







Abstract
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type&#8197;I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enables the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).

         <title>Microfluidic Precision Manufacture of High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Microspheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic precision manufacture for high performance chromatographic microspheres was developed, with an unprecedented 100&#8201;% production yield, independent controllability of morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The microspheres&#8217; continuous adjustability of pore size enables resolution fine&#8208;tuning for protein chromatography. Microfluidic precision manufacture paves the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.







Abstract
A key bottleneck in developing chromatographic material is the chemically entangled control of morphology, pore structure, and material chemistry, which holds back precision material manufacture in order to pursue advanced separation performance. In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed, for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control over particle morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&lt;3&#8201;%), enabling a 100&#8201;% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re&#8208;optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of hmin=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine&#8208;tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super&#8208;throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high&#8208;performance droplet&#8208;synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.

In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed, for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control over particle morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The droplet-synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&amp;lt;3&#8201;%), enabling a 100&#8201;% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet-synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re-optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine-tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super-throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high-performance droplet-synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chemically Powered Rotary Molecular Motor Based on Reversible Oxazepine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers.







Abstract
While biological machines are powered mainly by chemical transformations, chemically driven artificial rotary motor systems are very limited. Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers. Given the 95&#8201;% ee (97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5) and 88&#8201;% ee (94&#8201;:&#8201;6) of the individual gating steps of motor analogues, the overall directionality ratio could be calculated to be 91.7&#8201;:&#8201;8.3 (97.5&#8201;%&#215;94&#8201;%&#8776;91.7&#8201;%), which means that the motor will make one mistake (backward rotation) approximately every 11 to 12 turns.

         <dc:description>
The generic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold is described. The resulting artificial photoenzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Genetically encodable photosensitizers allow the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold via an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to&gt;99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of further photoenzymatic reactions.

         <title>Ultrahigh Proton Selectivity by Assembled Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up strategy with an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase for ionic covalent organic framework nanosheet fabrication is developed. The intermediate oil layer modulates the reaction rate to form a crystalline COF nanosheet with a high&#8208;aspect ratio. The resulting membrane exhibits outstanding proton selectivity over other cations.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are becoming increasingly attractive as promising two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for proton transport due to their ionic functionality and tailor&#8208;made pores. However, most synthetic methods for nanosheets rely on surface&#8208;assisted methods or phase transformation often yielding nanosheets with low aspect ratios. In this study, we present a bottom&#8208;up approach utilizing an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase system to achieve the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionic COF nanosheets. The intermediate oil layer in this system modulates the diffusion rate of monomers from the top oil phase into the aqueous phase, enabling in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from the initial discrete fibrous structure into large and crystalline COF nanosheets. The ionic COF nanosheets exhibit excellent proton permeability while simultaneously excluding other cations by casting into crack&#8208;free membranes, demonstrating efficient HCl extraction from acidic water waste. This strategy for larger&#8208;scale COF nanosheet growth will offer an alternative platform for designing multifunctional COF membranes with applications in sophisticated separation technologies.

         <title>Electrochemical Dicarboxylation of Vinyl Epoxide with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of Diacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electrochemical dicarboxylation of vinyl epoxides using CO2, featuring a CO2 radical anion addition induced sequential cleavage of two C&#8211;O bonds. This method displays high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity and is applicable to &#945;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8208;styryl epoxides, and cyclic carbonates. The versatility of the resulting multifunctional diacids is highlighted by their diverse functionalizations.







Abstract
We present a novel electrochemical dicarboxylation of epoxides with CO2, characterized by the cleavage of two C&#8722;O single bonds. Not only are vinyl epoxides viable, but cyclic carbonates also serve as effective substrates, facilitating the synthesis of E&#8208;configured adipic and octanedioic acids with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic practicality is further highlighted by the diverse functionalizations of the resulting multifunctional diacids. Mechanistic studies support the single&#8208;electron transfer reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO2, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.

Mechanistic studies support the single-electron transfer reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to its radical anion, which undergoes radical addition to the vinyl moiety of epoxides. The subsequent reductive cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, coupled with a nucleophilic attack on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, culminates in the formation of the desired diacid products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Applicable Descriptors under Weak Metal&#8208;Oxygen d&#8211;p Interaction for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New descriptors are presented for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in ionic systems. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, the limitations of the most widely used and crucial descriptors d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are demonstrated. Novel descriptors, &#955;1 and &#955;2, are proposed for more accurate OER performance predictions. Their application to multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides offers insights into designing more efficient catalytic materials.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in water electrolysis and renewable energy conversion processes. Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d&#8208;band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.

         <title>B12&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzymes Catalyze C&#8208;Fluoromethylation via a CH2F&#8208;Cobalamin Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferases were found to fluoromethylate unactivated carbon centers of peptide and natural products. This process was initiated by the 5'&#8208;dA radical produced from F&#8208;SAM and involved the important intermediate CH2F&#8208;cobalamin.







Abstract
Fluorine and fluorine&#8208;containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12&#8208;RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT. QCMT can cleave F&#8208;SAM to produce the 5'&#8208;dA radical. The significant reaction intermediate CH2FCbI was characterized by HR&#8208;MS, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, B12&#8208;RSMTs CysS and GenD1 can also transfer fluoromethyl groups onto natural products. We also found that F&#8208;SAM is not compulsory. The reduced B12&#8208;RSMTs can directly generate CH2FCbI with CH2FI and transfer the CH2F group when SAM is used as the radical initiator. Our results demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated enzymatic strategy for fluoromethylation with abiological cofactors and expand radical SAM enzymes to the field of fluorine chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#8208;Mediated Color&#8208;Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Helical Assemblies of Achiral Liquid Crystal Block Copolymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous axial chiral molecules induce helical assembly of liquid crystal block copolymers, achieving chiral transfer and amplification via non&#8208;covalent interaction and liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly. Dynamic covalent bonds of cyanostilbene groups are precisely tunable under UV light, enabling the fixation and unlocking of chiral information and color switching. This facile strategy provides guidance for visualizing chiral storage and encoding.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film attracted considerable attention in information storage and encryption, three&#8208;dimensional display, and chiral recognition. However, due to the limited molecular mobility within thin film, achieving a high asymmetry factor and non&#8208;contact modulation of CPL remain challenging. In this work, color&#8208;switchable homochiral CPL films with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum~0.11) were constructed based on the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (poly (ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly (methyl methacrylate) bearing cyanostilbene group) with axial chiral dinaphthalene diamine derivatives (R/S&#8208;DINBPA). Mechanistic investigation revealed that the efficient stacking of R/S&#8208;DINBPA with cyanostilbene groups and the liquid crystal field provide the driving force for chiral transfer and amplification. The dynamic covalent bonds of the cyanostilbene groups endow the film with chiral fixation ability and enable precise modulation of CPL luminescence bands under UV light irradiation, making it suitable for chiral patterned anti&#8208;counterfeit encryption. This facile strategy provides a general platform for designing intelligent chiroptical materials.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Diazoester Installation via Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylthianthrenium salts were converted into aryl diazoesters via palladium catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of advanced substrates with an &#945;&#8208;diazoester functionality. The thus introduced diazo moiety can subsequently undergo various C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
By leveraging the fast oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts (aryl&#8208;TT+) to palladium(0), a regioselective diazoester installation has been developed. This approach enables the introduction of a diazo moiety to densely functionalized arenes at a late stage. The installed diazo group is amenable to facile further derivatization.

         <title>Probing the Hidden Photoisomerization of a Symmetric Phosphaalkene Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch exhibiting degenerate photoisomerization. The research elucidates the isomerization mechanism using PC&#8208;EXSY NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and MRSF&#8208;TDDFT calculations. The work deepens our understanding of symmetric heteroalkene systems, opening new avenues for main group&#8208;based molecular machines.







Abstract
In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, and solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization experimentally for the first time. With a combination of photochemical&#8208;exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene, comparing it to two other known molecules belonging to this class. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light&#8208;induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air-stable, solvent-resistant phosphaalkene switch exhibiting degenerate photoisomerization. The research elucidates the isomerization mechanism using PC-EXSY NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and MRSF-TDDFT calculations. The work deepens our understanding of symmetric heteroalkene systems, opening new avenues for main group-based molecular machines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air-stable, and solvent-resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization &lt;i&gt;experimentally&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. With a combination of photochemical-exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene, comparing it to two other known molecules belonging to this class. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light-induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Reversed Functionalization of Aliphatic Aldehydes via Divergent Nickel Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;hydride catalyzed, polarity&#8208;reversed approach for divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes is reported. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Divergent catalysis represents an exciting frontier for unlocking molecular structural diversity and exploring new activation modes. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of polarity&#8208;reversed divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes, where enolizable aliphatic aldehydes are selectively activated by nickel hydride to form two distinct alkylnickel intermediates divergently. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfoximine substituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are prepared in one&#8208;pot and then diversified through 3 vectors. N&#8208;Functionalization allows controlled variation in the electrophilicity of the BCB in strain release processes including in protein labelling under biocompatible conditions, and the proximal stereocenter allows stereoselective protein labelling.







Abstract
Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0] butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.

         <title>Biofuel&#8208;Driven Stepping Chiral Supramolecular Transfer Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 5, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biofuel&#8208;mediated adaptive chiral luminescent supramolecular transfer container exhibited reversible thermal responsiveness and stepping&#8208;regulated chirality transfer by the catalysis of enzymes in tandem, as well as recovered chirality after refueled, achieving programmable regulation of multistate supramolecular chiroptical performance, which was successfully applied in logic gates and information encryption.







Abstract
Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5&#8201;% to 16.6&#8201;%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575&#8197;nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs=+6.4&#215;10&#8722;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.
