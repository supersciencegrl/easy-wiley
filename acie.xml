         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structures of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Coordination Environment Engineering for Boosting CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction owing to the synergistic effect between the binary metal sites. However, rationally modulating the electronic structure of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the electronic structure modulation of three Ni2 DACs (namely, Ni2&#8208;N7, Ni2&#8208;N5C2 and Ni2&#8208;N3C4) by the regulation of the coordination environments around the dual&#8208;atom Ni2 centres. As a result, Ni2&#8208;N3C4 exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, not only better than the corresponding single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2C2), but also higher than Ni2&#8208;N7 and Ni2&#8208;N5C2 DACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni2&#8208;N3C4 for CO2 reduction could be attributed to the electronic structure modulation to the Ni centre and the resulted proper binding energies to COOH* and CO* intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Open&#8208;cage Fullerene as Molecular Container for F&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208; and I&#8208;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7 steps and 5.5% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. Chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60 oC for 4 h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions were also achieved at slightly more enforcing conditions, 90 oC and around 14 h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordinating to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifice. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Catalytic Techniques in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the rapid industrialization across the world, various environmental pollutants have begun to accumulate in water, air and soil. This endangers the ecological environment of the earth, and environmental remediation has become an immediate concern. Among various environmental remediation techniques, piezo&#8208;catalytic techniques uniquely take advantage of piezoelectric effect, has attracted much attention. Piezoelectric effects allow for pollutant degradation directly, while also enhancing photocatalysis by reducing photogenerated carriers recombination. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent developments of piezo&#8208;catalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The foundation of piezoelectric effect, classification of piezoelectric materials and its application in environmental remediation are systematically summarized. We also analyze the potential underlying mechanisms. Finally, the urgent problems and prospects of piezo&#8208;catalytic techniques are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangements. These reactions, catalyzed by a chiral spiro phosphoric acid, afforded synthetically valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoketones which cannot be obtained by means of previously reported Heyns rearrangement methods. This method features low catalyst loadings, high yields and high enantioselectivities, making these reactions highly practical. We used the method to efficiently synthesize various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules. We experimentally proved that these acid&#8208;catalyzed Heyns rearrangements proceeded via a proton&#8208;transfer process involving an enol intermediate and the stereocontrol was realized during the proton&#8208;transfer step.</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid Against Amyloid: Dimeric Amyloid Fragment Ameliorates Cognitive Impairments by Direct Clearance of Oligomers and Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. However, anti&#8208;A&#946; drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure&#8208;based drug design and low permeability of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid&#8208;based anti&#8208;A&#946; peptidomimetics that exploits the self&#8208;assembling nature of A&#946; and penetrates the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N&#8208;terminal fragment of A&#946;, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize A&#946; oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y&#8208;maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB&#8208;A&#946; interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Decreased Water Mobility Contributes To Increased &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solvation shell is essential for the folding and function of proteins, but how it contributes to protein misfolding and aggregation has still to be elucidated. We show that the mobility of solvation shell H2O molecules influences the aggregation rate of the amyloid protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn), a protein associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. When the mobility of H2O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, &#945;Syn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and &#945;Syn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H2O to D2O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of &#945;Syn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H2O mobility and &#945;Syn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of &#945;Syn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

Oxygen&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;reactivity for robust tumor therapy: A PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photo&#8208;reactivity with response to oxygen&#8208;consumption was found in cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes, leading to potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis in zebrafish, and efficient suppression of mouse tumor xenografts.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a spatiotemporally controllable, powerful approach in combating cancers but suffers from low activity under hypoxia, whereas photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) operates in an O2&#8208;independent manner but compromises the ability to harness O2 for potent photosensitization. Herein we report that cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes display a PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photoactivity for efficient cancer treatment. On the one hand, the gold(III) complexes can act as dual photosensitizers and substrates, leading to conditional PDT activity in oxygenated condition that progresses to highly efficient PACT (&#981; up to 0.63) when O2 is depleted in solution and under cellular environment. On the other hand, the conditional PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT reactivity can be triggered by external photosensitizers in a similar manner in vitro and in vivo, giving additional tumor&#8208;selectivity and/or deep tissue penetration by red&#8208;light irradiation that leads to robust anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Realizing zT&gt;2 in Environment&#8208;Friendly Monoclinic Cu2S&#8212;Tetragonal Cu1.96S Nano&#8208;Phase Junctions for Thermoelectrics</title>

         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled phase junction nanocomposites are prepared by a novel surface ligand (decanethiol)&#8208;directed strategy. The conductivity is increased by modulation doping, and the phase boundary enhances phonon scattering, which helps to reduce lattice thermal conductivity. The combined effects yield a record&#8208;high zT=2.1 in metal sulfide thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites, made of nanograins with the same composition but different phases, offer a platform to optimize the physiochemical performance of materials. Herein, we demonstrate a straightforward strategy to synthesize Cu2&#8722;xS phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites by retaining surface 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands, in contrast to the traditional method that strips the ligands. As a result, phase junctions between a conventional monoclinic (m) phase and an unconventional metastable tetragonal (t) phase are obtained. The significantly improved power factor is obtained due to the doping of the t&#8208;phase. The phase&#8208;junction interfaces reduce thermal conductivity. Finally, surface regulation of phase junctions pushes the peak zT to 2.1 at 932&#8197;K, being the highest reported for environment&#8208;friendly metal sulfides. This work provides a paradigm to optimize thermoelectric performance by controlling phase junctions through surface&#8208;ligand tuning.

         <title>Co&#8208;compartmentalization of Enzymes and Cofactors within Pickering Emulsion Droplets for Continuous&#8208;Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow biocatalytic system based on the co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets has been developed. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, this system features long&#8208;term operational stability, excellent catalytic efficiency and no need for exogenous cofactors.







Abstract
Co&#8208;immobilization of enzymes and cofactors in a manner suitable for use in continuous flow catalysis remains a great challenge because of the difficulty in ensuring the free accessibility of immobilized enzymes and cofactors. Herein, we present a continuous flow catalysis system based on co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets, enabling regeneration of cofactors within the droplets. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, our systems exhibit long&#8208;term stability (300&#8211;400&#8197;h), outstanding total turnover number (TTN, 59204&#8197;mol mol&#8722;1) and several&#8208;fold enhancement in the enzyme catalytic efficiency (CEe) in comparison to conventional biphasic reactions. As well as giving insight into the co&#8208;compartmentalization effects, our system will provide the opportunity to significantly advance continuous&#8208;flow biocatalysis towards the level of practical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Vinylsilanes and Vinylboronates using Silicon or Boron as a Regioselectivity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination protocol allows simple vinylsilanes and vinylboronates to be selectively functionalized without competitive consumption of the reactive vinylmetalloid core structure, preserving its reactivity for future transformations such as cross&#8208;coupling or addition reactions. The silicon/boron group directs the regioselectivity of amination to the distal side of the C=C bond, allowing access to a complementary substitution pattern.







Abstract
Vinylsilanes and vinylboronates are common building blocks for organic synthesis, but direct functionalization of these species without the participation of either the C=C or C&#8722;Si/B bonds is rare. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction of these vinylmetalloid species that installs a new C&#8722;N bond without competing transmetallation or alkene addition. In this transformation, the silicon or boron substituent inverts the usual regioselectivity, directing amination to the site distal to that group. Subsequent cross&#8208;coupling or demetallation allows access to complementary regioisomeric products. Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon&#8208;bearing carbon atom.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Amino&#8208;Functionalized Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes via allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes with alkenes is of much interest and importance as a straightforward route for the construction of four&#8208;membered carbocycles but has remained much underexplored to date. Herein we report for the first time the intermolecular regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts. The reaction proceeded through an allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation mechanism initiated by the site&#8208;selective deprotonation of the allene unit by a rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl species followed by alkene insertion into the resulting metal&#8208;allenyl bond and the subsequent intramolecular cycloaddition to an allene C=C bond. This protocol offers a unique route for the synthesis of a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation of Hexafluoroacetone Hydrate Enables Hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported, wherein the intrinsic aldehyde/ketone&#8208;gem&#8208;diol equilibrium and photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation play key roles. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are compatible in this transformation, thus leading to structurally varied bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
An unprecedented photoredox&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation of hexafluoroacetone hydrate was established to accomplish the hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. A range of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols were facilely accessed by using readily available hexafluoroacetone hydrate, instead of toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are tolerated, giving the corresponding hydro&#8208;hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylated products in moderate to high yields. Remarkable features of this synthetic strategy include operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, excellent regioselectivity, and broad functional group tolerance. The success of this strategy relies on the delicate utilization of aldehyde/ketone&#8208;gem&#8208;diol intrinsic equilibrium, which offers an innovated open&#8208;shell pathway for the assembly of synthetically challenging polyfluoroalkylated scaffolds.

         <title>Modulating the Rise and Decay Dynamics of Upconversion Luminescence through Controlling Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the extensively investigated steady&#8208;state upconversion luminescence (UCL), systematic studies on temporal UCL are carried out, which have enabled wide modulation of the rise and decay dynamics of the UCL, and consequently a record adjustment of 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, as well as reversibly definable Er3+ emission color by simply tuning the pulse width of the excitation laser.







Abstract
Different from organic dye/quantum dot possessing one luminescent center, upconversion luminescence (UCL) is actually a statistic of temporal behaviors of countless individual activators. Our experimental results have shown that the rise and decay dynamics of UCL is directly associated with the relative contribution of sensitizer&#8208;to&#8208;activator energy transfer and energy migration among sensitizers, which can be physically modulated by simply tuning the excitation laser. Therefore, dynamic UCL with record&#8208;wide 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest&#8208;possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8211;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution by Side&#8208;Group Engineered Benzodiimidazole Oligomers with Strong Built&#8208;in Electric Fields and Short&#8208;Range Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxyl&#8208;rich benzodiimidazole oligomers (BDO&#8208;HC) are obtained through a side&#8208;group assisted self&#8208;assembly. The carboxyl&#8208;based strong built&#8208;in electric field promotes charge separation, and the nano&#8208;range crystals provide short channels for charge transfer. The photocatalyst is capable of efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution.







Abstract
The insufficient charge separation and sluggish exciton transport severely limit the utilization of polymeric photocatalysts. To resolve the above issues, we incorporate bountiful carboxyl substituents within a novel benzodiimidazole oligomer and assemble it into a crystalline semiconductor. The photocatalyst is polar, hydrophilic, short&#8208;range crystalline, and capable of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The introduction of carboxyl side&#8208;groups adds asymmetry to the local structure and increases the built&#8208;in electric field. Further, accelerated carrier transfer is enabled via the short&#8208;range crystallinity. The superior hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 18.63 and 2.87&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 represent one of the best performances ever reported among dual&#8208;functional polymeric photocatalysts. Our work initiates studies on high&#8208;performance oligomer photocatalysts, opening a new frontier to produce solar fuel.

         <title>On&#8208;Site Non&#8208;enzymatic Orthogonal Activation of a Catalytic DNA Circuit for Self&#8208;Reinforced In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;enzymatically and orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit was prepared for on&#8208;site and efficient in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging without off&#8208;site signal leakage. The CCD circuit integrates the cell&#8208;specific endogenous stimulation of the auxiliary catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with the orthogonal activation of the main entropy&#8208;driven DNA reaction (EDR) for sensitive target detection.







Abstract
The wide extracellular&#8208;intracellular distribution of microRNA requires the on&#8208;site, robust and efficient activation of catalytic DNA circuits inside live cells. Herein, we develop an efficient non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy to realize the orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit for achieving high&#8208;fidelity in vivo microRNA imaging through multiply guaranteed molecular recognition and progressively accelerated signal amplification. For predictable on&#8208;site activation and useful catalytic efficiency, the dominating circuitry fuel strand was initially split into inactive fuel subunits that were grafted into an auxiliary catalytic circuit. There, the in&#8208;cell&#8208;specific mRNA triggered the orthogonal amplification of the active fuel strands for sensitive target detection through the chief entropy&#8208;driven catalytic DNA circuit. We believe that the on&#8208;site orthogonal circuitry activation method can contribute to clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Ag22 Nanoclusters with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Protected by Ag/Cyanurate/Phosphine Metallamacrocyclic Monolayers through In&#8208;Situ Ligand Transesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isostructural Ag22 nanoclusters protected by a metallamacrocyclic monolayer were synthesized in high yields by in&#8208;situ ligand formation strategy. The high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity triazine&#8208;based cyanurate ligands endow the clusters with unique core&#8208;shell interfacial bonding structure and donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structure, resulting in the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic.







Abstract
The composition of protection monolayer exerts great influence on the molecular and electronic structures of atomically precise monolayer protected metal nanoclusters. Four isostructural Ag/cyanurate/phosphine metallamacrocyclic monolayer protected Ag22 nanoclusters are synthesized by kinetically controlled in&#8208;situ ligand formation&#8208;driven strategy. These eight&#8208;electron superatomic silver nanoclusters feature an unprecedented interfacial bonding structure with diverse E&#8208;Ag (E=O/N/P/Ag) interactions between the Ag13 core and metallamacrocyclic monolayer, and displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), benefiting from their distinct donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structures. This work not only unmasks a new core&#8208;shell interface involving cyanurate ligand but also underlines the significance of high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity N&#8208;heterocyclic ligand in synthesizing TADF metal nanoclusters. This is the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with TADF characteristic.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Assisted Charge Transport through Positively Charged Dimer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer single&#8208;molecule junction with positively charged units is constructed through host&#8211;guest interaction using graphene&#8208;based static molecular junctions. A transition mechanism from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport is observed, which is caused by thermally&#8208;induced specific molecular vibration modes. The introduction of positive charge can improve the incoherent transport process.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport plays a vital role in the fields of electronics, as well as biochemical systems. Here, we design supramolecular dimer junctions and investigate the effects of charge state and energy level alignment on charge transport under nanoconfinement. Incoherent tunneling caused by thermally&#8208;induced vibrations is enhanced in positively charged systems. The transition between coherent and incoherent tunneling is associated with specific molecular vibration modes. Positively charged systems with smaller torsional barriers and vibrational frequencies result in lower transition temperatures. Multiple thermal effects have a great impact on the conductance in the off&#8208;resonant tunneling, while thermally&#8208;induced vibron&#8208;assisted tunneling contributes more to the transport in the resonant tunneling. These investigations offer a deep mechanism understanding of intermolecular charge transport and facilitate the development of practical functional molecular devices.

         <title>Exploring the Gas&#8208;Phase Formation and Chemical Reactivity of Highly Reduced M8L6 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination cages containing porphyrin subunits are reduced up to fourteen times in the gas phase. While the presence or absence of Nickel(II) coordinated in the porphyrin binding site does not affect the rate of reduction, the reactivity of the reduced species toward molecular O2 is significantly enhanced in the former case. Additionally, the presence of a C60 fullerene guest within the nickelated cage reduces its reactivity.







Abstract
Coordination cages with well&#8208;defined cavities show great promise in the field of catalysis on account of their unique combination of molecular confinement effects and transition&#8208;metal redox chemistry. Here, three coordination cages are reduced from their native 16+ oxidation state to the 2+ state in the gas phase without observable structural degradation. Using this method, the reaction rate constants for each reduction step were determined, with no noticeable differences arising following either the incorporation of a C60&#8208;fullerene guest or alteration of the cage chemical structure. The reactivity of highly reduced cage species toward molecular oxygen is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; after a threshold number of reduction steps, which is influenced by guest molecules and the structure of cage components. These new experimental approaches provide a unique window to explore the chemistry of highly&#8208;reduced cage species that can be modulated by altering their structures and encapsulated guest species.

         <title>Decarboxylative Selective Phosphorylation of Aliphatic Acids: A Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208; and Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Avenue to Dialkyl and Trialkyl Phosphine Oxides from White Phosphorus</title>

         <dc:description>
Functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to synthesize dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. The oxidation products can be isolated in high yield via the air oxidation of alkylated phosphines.







Abstract
Developing practical and mild strategies for the direct functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) without chlorination is an appealing but formidable challenge. To this end, we report a breakthrough in the preparation of structurally diverse dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines that rely on the successive generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters and the controllable alkylation of the P4 molecule under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. To facilitate separation and prevent product losses during purification, the corresponding oxidation products dialkylphosphine oxides (DAPOs) and trialkylphosphine oxides (TAPOs) were isolated. This photoinduced phosphorylation reaction features one&#8208;pot operation, high product selectivity, and tolerates a broad range of alkyl NHPI esters, including derivatives of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals. Further diversified transformation of DAPOs to construct P&#8722;F, P&#8722;C, P&#8722;N, and P&#8722;O bonds was also demonstrated.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;CuI&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been constructed to exhibit aggregation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence with large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027. Inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent TADF properties strongly associated with ligand&#8208;ligand rotation of enantiomer molecules were also demonstrated.







Abstract
The field of luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials has been blossoming in recent years, although chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes have not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, the first reported for CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of the CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these CuI enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into the optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from the perspective of aggregation states.

Inspiring aggregation-dependent TADF properties strongly associated with ligand-ligand rotation of enantiomer molecules were also demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of luminescent carbene-metal-amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical-active materials has been blossoming in recent years, although chiroptical-active CMA complexes have not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-based CMA enantiomers, &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PSIPr*-Cu-DMAC&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-PSIPr*-Cu-DMAC&lt;/b&gt;, have been developed by using chiral phenyl-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation-induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, the first reported for CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand-ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of the CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation-dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into the optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from the perspective of aggregation states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Structural Motif in Lanthipeptide Synthetases for Substrate Binding and Interdomain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structural motif for leader binding and interdomain interactions was identified in the crystal structure of the kinase domain of class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC responsible for the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. This motif consists of two N&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, a central &#945;&#8208;helix, and three C&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets.







Abstract
Class III lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze the formation of lanthionine/methyllanthionine and labionin crosslinks. We present here the 2.40&#8197;&#197; resolution structure of the kinase domain of a class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC from the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. A unique structural subunit for leader binding, named leader recognition domain (LRD), was identified. The LRD of CurKC is responsible for the recognition of the leader peptide and for mediating interactions between the lyase and kinase domains. LRDs are highly conserved among the kinase domains of class III and class IV lanthipeptide synthetases. The discovery of LRDs provides insight into the substrate recognition and domain organization in multidomain lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>Enantiomeric NIR&#8208;II Emitting Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Doped Ag2Se Nanoparticles with Differentiated In Vivo Imaging Efficiencies</title>

Chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs by introducing RuCl[(p&#8208;cymene(BINAP)]Cl as ligands were synthesized. Nd3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ as sensitizers case a fluorescence red&#8208;shift to 1550&#8197;nm with an intensity increased by 145.7&#8208;fold compared with Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs. The fluorescence imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs was 2&#8208;fold higher than that of S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs.







Abstract
Here, chiral second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emitting rare&#8208;earth doped silver selenide nanoparticles (R&#8208; or S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs) were fabricated, exhibiting circular dichroism peak at 850&#8197;nm and fluorescence peak at 1550&#8197;nm, with 145.7&#8208;fold enhanced intensity compared to the reported Ag2Se NPs. Compared with S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs, imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs in living cells was significantly improved due to a higher cellular uptake rate and 927.7&#8208;fold higher affinity. Furthermore, R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs reached at the tumor 2&#8208;fold faster than S type of NPs in vivo. We discover that chirality leads to differences in the affinity between chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) onto the surface of murine mammary carcinoma cell to cause different in vivo imaging efficiency. These results reveal that chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs have high photoluminescence intensity and high in vivo imaging efficiency reflecting wide applications in biomedical diagnosis.

         <title>Pt Atoms/Clusters on Ni&#8208;phytate&#8208;sensitized Carbon Nitride for Enhanced NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven Overall Water Splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting was constructed by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4&#8197;&#956;mol at &#955;&gt;800&#8197;nm for 24&#8197;hours, which its activity was approximately 140&#8197;times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.

         <title>Integrating a Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probe with a Microfluidic Platform for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Erythrocyte Membrane Dynamics
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red fluorescent probe with blinking and lasting emission is developed to meet the contradictory requirements of super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking. A microfluidic device is fabricated to trap red blood cells (RBCs) and to enable the manipulation of the microenvironment. The integration of the probe and device has uncovered nanoscale dynamics of living RBC membranes, providing a means to advance diagnostics to the molecular level.







Abstract
Living erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) membranes present rich ultrastructural and dynamic details, which require synchronous super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking to be revealed. Yet, it poses a serious challenge to achieve these dual functions in a single probe, due to the rigid and conflicting photophysical demands of the different techniques. Herein, we rationally developed a far&#8208;red boron dipyrromethene membrane probe with blinking capability and persistent single&#8208;molecule emission, and constructed a microfluidic platform for noninvasive trapping and long&#8208;term imaging of RBCs. By combining them, multi&#8208;dimensional super&#8208;resolution reconstructions and single&#8208;molecule tracking were achieved at the molecular scale on living human RBC membranes in a high&#8208;throughput manner. Our integrated system defines a quantitative method for analyzing RBC membranes under physiological and pathological conditions, improving precision and revealing new perspectives for future disease diagnostics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography: A New Paradigm for Versatility in Simultaneous Multicomponent Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid separation technique, referred to as Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), enabling simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range is introduced. DGUC lays the foundation for the next generation of hybrid chromatographic techniques with the deployment of universal elution profiles obtained via multi&#8208;eluent blending beyond traditional separation modes.







Abstract
Generality in analytical chemistry can be manifested in impactful platforms that can streamline modern organic synthesis and biopharmaceutical processes. We herein introduce a hybrid separation technique named Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), which is built upon an automated dynamic modulation of CO2, organic modifier, and water blends with various buffers. This concept enables simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range in single experimental runs. After a careful investigation of its fundamental aspects, a DGUC&#8208;DAD&#8208;MS screening workflow that combines multiple orthogonal column and mobile phase choices across a far&#8208;reaching universal elution profile is also reported. The power of this framework is demonstrated with new analytical applications guiding academic and industrial laboratories in the development of new (bio)pharmaceutical targets (e.g. synthetic intermediates, nucleosides, cyclic and linear peptides, proteins, antibody drug conjugates).

         <title>Linker Redox Mediated Control of Morphology and Properties in Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Semiquinoid Coordination Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>

A novel 3D semiconducting coordination polymer Fe5(C6O6)3 is reported with high conductivity, broad electronic transitions and interesting thermoelectric/magnetic properties. The unique structure and properties of this material illustrate that controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting metal&#8208;organic materials can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies, properties, and functionalities.







Abstract
The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP Fe5(C6O6)3, which is a fusion of 2D Fe&#8208;semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic Fex(C6O6)y materials, by using a different initial redox&#8208;state of the C6O6 linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2&#963;=7.0&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature. This material illustrates how controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting CPs/MOFs can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies and properties in contrast to more commonly encountered post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Complexes Empowered by London Dispersion: The C&#8722;H Functionalization Nexus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encounter of a donor/acceptor diazo derivative with a hydrocarbon inside the chiral binding pocket crafted by London dispersion about a heterobimetallic [BiRh] paddlewheel complex entails highly effective asymmetric C&#8722;H insertion; the resulting products formally correspond to the outcome of classical ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, or aldol reactions.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic [BiRh] tetracarboxylate catalysts endowed with 1,3&#8208;disilylated phenylglycine paddlewheels benefit from interligand London dispersion. They were originally designed for asymmetric cyclopropanation but are now shown to perform very well in asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions too. Because of the confined ligand sphere about the derived donor/acceptor carbenes, insertions into unhindered methyl groups are kinetically favored, although methylene units also react with excellent levels of asymmetric induction; even gaseous ethane is a suitable substrate. Moreover, many functional groups in both partners are tolerated. The resulting products are synthetically equivalent to the outcome of traditional asymmetric ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, propargylation and aldol reactions and therefore constitute a valuable nexus to more conventional chemical logic.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Enhanced Oncolytic Virus&#8208;Like Nanoparticle for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy is proposed to enhance T cell&#8208;mediated tumor immunotherapy by synthesizing an ion&#8208;enhanced nanoplatform PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8. This nanoplatform not only mimics an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function by inducing cell apoptosis to recruit T cells in a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner but also releases Zn2+ to enhance T cell recruitment and activation in a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner.







Abstract
T lymphocytes (T cells) are essential for tumor immunotherapy. However, the insufficient number of activated T cells greatly limits the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we proposed an oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy to enhance T cell recruitment and activation for tumor treatment. We constructed an oncolytic virus&#8208;like nanoplatform (PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8) that was degraded in the acidic tumor environment to release PolyIC and Zn2+. The released PolyIC exhibited an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function that induced tumor cell apoptosis and promoted T cell recruitment and activation through a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner. More importantly, the released Zn2+ not only enhanced T cell recruitment by inducing CXCL9/10/11 expression but also promoted T cell activation to increase interferon&#8208;&#947; (INF&#8208;&#947;) expression by inducing the phosphorylation of ZAP&#8208;70 via a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner. This Zn2+&#8208;enhanced oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy provides a new approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Sactipeptide Engineering by Probing the Substrate Tolerance of a Thioether&#8208;Bond&#8208;Forming Sactisynthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sactipeptides are a class of microbial peptides possessing thioether crosslinks. We demonstrate sactipeptide engineering without compromising their post&#8208;translational modification introduced by sactisynthases. A variety of natural and hybrid sactipeptide constructs were generated and analyzed for the presence of thioether crosslinks, demonstrating the possibility to design variants with novel functionalities.







Abstract
Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &#945;&#8208;carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases, this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in&#8208;depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides.

     alt="Sactipeptide Engineering by Probing the Substrate Tolerance of a Thioether-Bond-Forming Sactisynthase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sactipeptides are a class of microbial peptides possessing thioether crosslinks. We demonstrate sactipeptide engineering without compromising their post-translational modification introduced by sactisynthases. A variety of natural and hybrid sactipeptide constructs were generated and analyzed for the presence of thioether crosslinks, demonstrating the possibility to design variants with novel functionalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases, this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in-depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides. We identified a possible modification site within the sactipeptide subtilosin A allowing for peptide engineering without compromising formation of thioether bridges. A panel of natural and hybrid sactipeptides was produced to study the AlbA-mediated formation of thioether bridges, which were identified mass-spectrometrically. In a proof-of-principle study, we re-engineered subtilosin A to a thioether-bridged, specific streptavidin targeting peptide, opening the door for the functional engineering of sactipeptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dearomative (3+2) Cycloadditions between Indoles and Vinyldiazo Species Enabled by a Red&#8208;Shifted Chromium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst based on Earth&#8208;abundant chromium is described. The catalyst enables a dearomative (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents. Densely functionalized indoline compounds are readily accessed in high yields and exclusive regioselectivity.







Abstract
A direct dearomative photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents is described. The transformation is enabled by the development of a novel oxidizing CrIII photocatalyst, its specific reactivity attributed to increased absorptive properties over earlier Cr analogs and greater stability than Ru counterparts. A variety of fused indoline compounds are synthesized using this method, including densely functionalized ring systems that are feasible due to base&#8208;free conditions. Experimental insights corroborate a cycloaddition initiated by nucleophilic attack at C3 of the indole radical cation by the vinyldiazo species.

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction strategy is taken to synthesize diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu catalysts on 2D phosphorene. Owing to the strength of the unique synergistic effect of PdCuP4 coordination, the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the transfer of intermediates, and the formation of N&#8801;N bond are all enhanced, leading to a high NO3&#8722; removal rate and N2 selectivity.







Abstract
The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP4 coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3&#8201;% NO3&#8722; removal rate and 95.2&#8201;% N2 selectivity. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO2&#8722;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N2.

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>

         <dc:description>
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties and Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A computational study reproduced their various experimental reactivities and revealed subtle and sometimes unexpected interwoven effects of steric and electronic factors, which offer the first mechanistic understanding of substituent effects for excellent HNO sensors to facilitate future development.







Abstract
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced diverse experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.

         <title>Redesign of Rifamycin Antibiotics to Overcome ADP&#8208;Ribosylation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>

         <dc:description>
The first antibiotics with low nanomolar activity against the multidrug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium abscessus are achieved by rational redesign of rifamycins. Structure&#8208;based modification on the rifamycin ansa&#8208;chain, together with microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and in vivo characterizations, provides novel candidates that are 300&#8208;fold more active than rifampicin, completely bypass the resistance, and possess promising pharmacokinetic profiles.







Abstract
Rifamycin antibiotics are a valuable class of antimicrobials for treating infections by mycobacteria and other persistent bacteria owing to their potent bactericidal activity against replicating and non&#8208;replicating pathogens. However, the clinical utility of rifamycins against Mycobacterium abscessus is seriously compromised by a novel resistance mechanism, namely, rifamycin inactivation by ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a structure&#8208;based approach, we rationally redesign rifamycins through strategic modification of the ansa&#8208;chain to block ADP&#8208;ribosylation while preserving on&#8208;target activity. Validated by a combination of biochemical, structural, and microbiological studies, the most potent analogs overcome ADP&#8208;ribosylation, restored their intrinsic low nanomolar activity and demonstrated significant in vivo antibacterial efficacy. Further optimization by tuning drug disposition properties afforded a preclinical candidate with remarkable potency and an outstanding pharmacokinetic profile.

         <title>Microbial Fermentation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Plastic Waste for the Production of Chemicals or Electricity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with Ideonella sakaiensis releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Here, a fermentative metabolic pathway in Ideonella sakaiensis was uncovered facilitating PET degradation while producing valuable feedstock chemicals or electricity in a microbial fuel cell with Geobacter sulfurreducens. This &#8216;plastic fermentation&#8217; process provides opportunities for future bioenergy technologies while combating plastic pollution.







Abstract
Ideonella sakaiensis (I.&#8197;sakaiensis) can grow on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the major carbon and energy source. Previous work has shown that PET conversion in the presence of oxygen released carbon dioxide and water while yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that I.&#8197;sakaiensis is a facultative anaerobe that ferments PET to the feedstock chemicals acetate and ethanol in the absence of oxygen. In addition to PET, the pure monomer ethylene glycol (EG), the intermediate product ethanol, and the carbohydrate fermentation test substance maltose can also serve as fermenting substrates. Co&#8208;culturing of I.&#8197;sakaiensis with the electrogenic and acetate&#8208;consuming Geobacter sulfurreducens produced electricity from PET or EG. This newly identified plastic fermentation process by I.&#8197;sakaiensis provides thus a novel biosynthetic route to produce high&#8208;value chemicals or electricity from plastic waste streams.

&lt;p&gt;Microbial degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with &lt;i&gt;Ideonella sakaiensis&lt;/i&gt; releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Here, a fermentative metabolic pathway in &lt;i&gt;Ideonella sakaiensis&lt;/i&gt; was uncovered facilitating PET degradation while producing valuable feedstock chemicals or electricity in a microbial fuel cell with &lt;i&gt;Geobacter sulfurreducens&lt;/i&gt;. This &#8216;plastic fermentation&#8217; process provides opportunities for future bioenergy technologies while combating plastic pollution.

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing a Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade cyclopolymerization is developed to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The regioselectivity is controlled by altering the structure of the catalyst, affording polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings. The resulting polymers show narrow band gaps due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.







Abstract
Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6&#8197;eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.

         <title>Salting&#8208;Out Aldehyde from the Electrooxidation of Alcohols with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has significant challenges, for example, it cannot realize the preparation of aldehydes selectively in alkaline aqueous solutions. By tuning the local microenvironment over the electrocatalyst, and thus selectively salting&#8208;out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface, the electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes was achieved in an efficient and green way.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehydes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to its higher reactivity than alcohol, the aldehyde is easily over&#8208;oxidized to acid in alkaline electrolytes. Herein we realize the selective electrooxidation of alcohol to aldehyde on NiO by tuning the local microenvironment to salt out the aldehyde from the reaction system. The origin of the high selectivity was found to be the inhibition of the hydration of aldehydes, which is the result of the decreased alkalinity and the increased cation and substrate concentration. This strategy could salt out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface from the electrooxidation of alcohol with 100&#8201;% selectivity and be easily extended to other selective oxidation reactions, such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) and amine to an imine.

         <title>Exceeding 30&#8201;% External Quantum Efficiency in Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Utilizing Solution Processable TADF Emitters with High Horizontal Dipole Orientation via Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchoring strategy was firstly proposed to generate solution processable TADF emitters from isotropic orientation to horizontal one by attaching bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core via flexible chains. With outstanding characteristics in pristine films, unprecedented EQEmaxs of 30.6&#8201;% and 25.6&#8201;% were achieved for solution processable non&#8208;doped OLEDs and TSF OLEDs, respectively.







Abstract
Strategies to enhance the ratio of the molecular horizontal emitting dipole orientation (&#920;&#8741;) for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have unlocked the full potential of efficiencies for the evaporated devices, which, however, remain elusive for the solution&#8208;processed ones. Here, a strategic molecular design for solution processable TADF emitters featuring high &#920;&#8741;s is proposed by attaching flexible chains ended with bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core. It's unveiled that the anchoring groups not only enhance the horizontal orientation via enlarging molecular planarity, but also benefit the high photoluminescence in pristine films. The corresponding non&#8208;doped solution processable OLEDs substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax)&gt;30&#8201;%. Meanwhile, combining these compounds as TADF sensitizers, and multiple resonance final emitter, solution&#8208;processed OLEDs achieve an EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of an Aryl&#8208;Alkene Axis by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkene skeletons via classic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction has been challenging compared to the biaryls. Rational optimization established an enabling 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand for asymmetric coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under mild conditions, affording the acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes in good yield, atroposelectivity and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
The application of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction to forge the atropisomeric biaryls has seen remarkable progress but exploration of this chemistry to directly forge chiral C(aryl)&#8208;C(alkene) axis is underdeveloped. The replacement of arene substrates by alkenes intensifies the challenges in terms of reactivity, configurational atropostability of product and selectivity control. By meticulous ligand design and fine&#8208;tuning of reaction parameters, we identified a highly active 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand to realize arene&#8208;alkene Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under very mild conditions. The axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes were generated in commendable efficiency, enantioselectivity and E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Formation of Artificial Enzymes on Filamentous Phage for Ultrasensitive Direct Detection of Circulating miRNA Biomarkers in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As triggered by the target, an artificial enzyme was site&#8208;specifically formed at the tip of filamentous M13 phage, generating a novel catalytic nanomaterial for miRNA analysis. miRNAs in human plasma samples, tumor cells, and tissues were detected with high sensitivity comparable to qRT&#8208;PCR, showing a great possibility of clinical applications.







Abstract
Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target&#8208; and site&#8208;specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site&#8208;specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody&#8208;modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0&#8197;fM, about 103 folds lower than the phage&#8208;free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target&#8208;triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.

         <title>Human Cyclophilin B Nuclease Activity Revealed via Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs electrochemical DNA&#8208;based sensors to investigate the hydrolytic activity of a previously unknown nuclease, cyclophilin B. The protein is secreted by pancreatic cancer cells and could be a biomarker for early&#8208;stage cancer diagnoses. However, the demonstrated nuclease activity will limit bioassay development based on natural nucleic acid aptamers. Instead, we propose DNA stereoisomers (l&#8208;DNA) to overcome this challenge.







Abstract
Human cyclophilin B (CypB) is oversecreted by pancreatic cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. Our group is motivated to develop aptamer&#8208;based assays to measure CypB levels in biofluids. However, human cyclophilins have been postulated to have collateral nuclease activity, which could impede the use of aptamers for CypB detection. To establish if CypB can hydrolyze electrode&#8208;bound nucleic acids, we used ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors to measure CypB's hydrolytic activity. Our sensors use ssDNA and dsDNA in the biologically predominant d&#8208;DNA form, and in the nuclease resistant l&#8208;DNA form. Challenging such sensors with CypB and control proteins, we unequivocally demonstrate that CypB can cleave nucleic acids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use electrochemical biosensors to reveal the hydrolytic activity of a protein that is not known to be a nuclease. Future development of CypB bioassays will require the use of nuclease&#8208;resistant aptamer sequences.

         <title>Simultaneous Photo&#8208;Induced Magnetic and Dielectric Switching in an Iron(II)&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Crossover Hofmann&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>

A new 3D Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene) is prepared. It displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties accompanied by structural phase transitions between different space groups.







Abstract
Molecular materials possessing photo&#8208;tunable polarization switching is promising for optical switches, smart sensors, and data storage devices. However, it is challenging to devise a molecular material featuring simultaneous switchable magnetic and dielectric properties with regard to non&#8208;invasive and convenient light stimulus. Herein, we report a new Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene), which displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties. Photo&#8208;monitored structural analyses revealed that it was the photo&#8208;induced deformation of FeII coordination sphere and relative movement of guest anthracene that resulted in the variation of the local electric dipoles. These findings provide a new strategy to realize polarization switching through the light&#8208;induced spin crossover, and would be of fundamental significance for future photo&#8208;switchable and multifunctional materials.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Packing by Terminal tert&#8208;Butylation for Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Emission and Efficacious Charge Transport in an Anthracene&#8208;Based Molecular Crystal</title>

An anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal with a unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif has been developed by delicate crystal engineering through terminal tert&#8208;butylation. Appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling/electron&#8208;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum efficiency, &#934;F=74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1).







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with combinative high carrier mobility and efficient solid&#8208;state emission are full of challenges but urgently pursued for developing new emerging optoelectronics. Herein, by delicately regulating the crystal packing of an anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal via terminal tert&#8208;butylation, we developed a superior high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;di(6&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnaphthyl)anthracene (TBU&#8208;DNA). The unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif of TBU&#8208;DNA enables its appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus resulting in remarkably high solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;F&#8776;74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, OLETs based on TBU&#8208;DNA show an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest EQE values for single component OLETs reported till now. This work presents a crystal engineering strategy via exquisite molecular design to realize high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

The diazo group is highly reactive and provides biological activity to natural products. By genome mining of the diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes, an avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77. This pathway includes two enzymes, AvaA6 and AvaA7, catalyzing the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group that can confer biological activity to natural products owing to its high reactivity. Recent studies have revealed that diazo groups are synthesized from amino groups using nitrous acid in secondary metabolites of actinomycetes. However, genome database analysis indicated that there are still many diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes for unknown biosynthetic pathways. Here, we discovered an avenalumic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77 by genome mining of enzymes involved in diazo group formation. Through heterologous expression, the gene cluster was revealed to direct avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthesis via 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;AAA). In vitro enzyme assays showed that AvaA6 and AvaA7 catalyzed the diazotization of 3&#8208;AAA using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively. This study revealed an unprecedented pathway for amino group removal via diazotization.

         <title>Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) Tags for Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation, On&#8208;Resin Protein&#8208;Protein Coupling, and Purification of Protein Conjugates</title>

         <dc:description>
Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry tags (ABC&#8208;tags) based on 2&#8208;pyridyltetrazines serve a dual role by enabling protein purification through metal chelation and still maintaining their rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging is successful for proteins tagged at the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions, is successful in complex mixtures including cell lysate, and can be carried out on&#8208;resin to generate multidomain proteins.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of proteins has broad application in chemical biology, but can be limited when mixtures result from incomplete conversion or the formation of protein containing side products. It is shown here that when proteins are covalently tagged with pyridyl&#8208;tetrazines, the nickel&#8208;iminodiacetate (Ni&#8208;IDA) resins commonly used for His&#8208;tags can be directly used for protein affinity purification. These Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) tags serve a dual role by enabling affinity&#8208;based protein purification while maintaining rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging works with a range of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods with proteins tagged at the C&#8208;terminus, N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions. ABC&#8208;tagged proteins can also be purified from complex mixtures including cell lysate. The combination of site&#8208;selective conjugation and clean&#8208;up with ABC&#8208;tagged proteins also allows for facile on&#8208;resin reactions to provide protein&#8208;protein conjugates.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208; and Selenol&#8208;Assisted Delivery of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although aryl thioamides are often used to assess the pharmacological effects of H2S, their reactivity is extremely sluggish and their release of H2S is highly inefficient. Herein, we report that H2S liberation from this donor class can be augmented with intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. We envision this new chemistry serving as a general design strategy for accessing efficient donors that selectively respond to various biological stimuli.







Abstract
Arylthioamides have been frequently employed to assess the chemical biology and pharmacology of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). From this class of donors, however, extremely low H2S releasing efficiencies have been reported and proper mechanistic studies have been omitted. Consequently, millimolar concentrations of arylthioamides are required to liberate just trace amounts of H2S, and via an unidentified mechanistic pathway, which obfuscates the interpretation of any biological activity that stems from their use. Herein, we report that H2S release from this valuable class of donors can be markedly enhanced through intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that both disulfide&#8208; and diselenide&#8208;linked thioamides are responsive to biologically relevant concentrations of glutathione and release two molar equivalents of H2S via an intramolecular cyclization that significantly augments their rate and efficiency of sulfide delivery in both buffer and live human cells.

         <title>A Library of Rare Earth Oxide Ultrathin Nanowires with Polymer&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile colloidal method to synthesize ultrathin nanowires at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) is developed. The mechanism of nanocrystal growth along different dimensions is discussed. Fifteen kinds of RE&#8208;Mo&#8208;O (RE=Y, La&#8208;Nd, and Sm&#8208;Lu) ultrathin nanowires could be synthesized using this method. All of them exhibited polymer&#8208;like behavior.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer&#8208;like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet&#8208; and electro&#8208;spinning of Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8&#8201;%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.

         <title>Quantum Interference in Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: Tuning Electronic Coupling Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ground state electronic interaction in the mixed&#8208;valence complex [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ can be tuned through the introduction of an OMe substituent to the bridging ligand. These effects are sensitive to the position of the substituent, and follow the same patterns as those predicted by quantum circuit rules for weakly coupled molecules in molecular junctions.







Abstract
Whilst 2&#8208; or 5&#8208;OMe groups on the bridging phenylene ring in [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ have little influence on the electronic structure of this weakly coupled mixed&#8208;valence complex, a 4&#8208;OMe substituent enhances ground state electron delocalization, and increases the intensity of the IVCT transition. Vibrational frequency and TDDFT calculations (LH20t&#8208;D3(BJ), def2&#8208;SVP, COSMO (CH2Cl2)) on ([{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H3&#8208;n&#8208;OMe)]+ (n=2, 4, 5) models are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The stronger ground state coupling is attributed to the change in composition of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO brought about by the 4&#8208;OMe group, which is ortho or para to each of the metal fragments. The intensity of the IVCT transition increases with the greater overlap of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO, whilst the relative phases of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO in the 4&#8208;OMe substituted complex are consistent with predictions of constructive quantum interference from molecular circuit rules.

The intensity of the IVCT transition increases with the greater overlap of the &#946;-HOSO and &#946;-LUSO, whilst the relative phases of the &#946;-HOSO and &#946;-LUSO in the 4-OMe substituted complex are consistent with predictions of constructive quantum interference from molecular circuit rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Phase Separation Behavior and Pathway&#8208;Directed Information Exchange in all&#8208;DNA Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage mechanism is discovered in the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation pathways of ssDNA to form all&#8208;DNA coacervates. Distinct ion&#8208;specific pathways allow the generation of new coacervate structures by mixing multiple coacervate systems, leading to pathway&#8208;controlled coacervate&#8208;protocell communication and information exchange.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating cell&#8208;mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all&#8208;DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one&#8208;component DNA droplets and two&#8208;component core&#8211;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell&#8208;mimicking systems.

         <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten Kinetic Rates and Its Application to the Analysis of CRISPR&#8208;Based Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The estimation of Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetic parameters is highly sensitive to small experimental errors, even though the quantification of such parameters is critical. Monte Carlo simulations show that the kinetic efficiency, which governs limit of detection of assays that require low background, is the most precise kinetic parameter.







Abstract
Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics is an essential model to rationalize enzyme reactions. The quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten parameters can be very challenging as it is sensitive to even small experimental errors. We here present a quantification of the uncertainty inherent to the experimental determination of kinetic rate parameters for enzymatic reactions. We study the influence of several sources of uncertainty and bias, including the inner filter effect, pipetting errors, number of points in the Michaelis&#8211;Menten curve, and flat&#8208;field correction. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analyses of experimental data, we compute typical uncertainties of 
, 
, and catalytic efficiency 
. As a salient example, we analyze the extraction of such parameters for CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems. CRISPR diagnostics have recently attracted much interest and yet reports of these enzymatic kinetic rates have been highly unreliable and inconsistent.

A non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy can realize an orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit through multiple molecular recognition events and progressively accelerated signal amplification, as reported by Fuan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202206529). The on&#8208;site activated CCD circuitry system has considerable potential for high&#8208;precision in&#8197;vivo imaging of low&#8208;abundance microRNA.

Appropriate exciton&#8211;exciton coupling/electron&#8211;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission and efficient charge transport, as reported by Wenping Hu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202206825).

         <title>Inside Cover: A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 45/2022)</title>

A proton conductive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid derivative with an 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether component. Despite the flexibility of the macrocycle, H&#8208;bonding modules allow the derivative to yield a hexagonally networked framework with permanent porosity. As reported by Takayoshi Nakamura, Ichiro Hisaki, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202211686), the HOF possesses 1D channels with a bottleneck composed of the macrocycles and shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through the Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of ultrathin nanowires has thermodynamic advantages at low temperature. However, at low temperatures the monomers for nanocrystal growth are difficult to generate through precursor decomposition. In their Research Article (e202212251), Di Qiu, Yaping Du, and co&#8208;workers report an efficient growth process based on adding polyoxometalate clusters to the monomers. Fifteen types of rare earth oxide ultrathin nanowires were synthesized, all exhibiting polymer&#8208;like behavior due to the extremely high aspect ratio.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Plant&#8208;Produced Toxin Strychnine Elucidated</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strychnine is a notorious neurotoxic plant alkaloid that has been studied for centuries. A recent report from the O'Connor group has successfully elucidated the biosynthesis of strychnine for the first time using modern transcriptomics and protein expression methods, laying a foundation for future studies to engineer production or modifications of this important natural product.







Abstract
While natural products isolated from plants have historically been an important source of bioactive molecules, elucidating their biosynthetic pathways has remained a challenging process. Strychnine is the one such compound known for its neurotoxicity and use as a rodent pesticide. Considerable interest has been shown in the synthesis of strychnine for many decades, yet little was known about its biosynthesis. A recent report from the O'Connor lab has solved this long&#8208;standing puzzle using modern transcriptomics and transient expression approaches to uncover each enzyme responsible for the production of strychnine along with an unexpected final non&#8208;enzymatic step.

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an important strategy for developing new reactions in stereodivergent synthesis. This strategy is also a simple and powerful approach for synthesizing all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters from the same set of starting materials. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and briefly gives perspectives for the future advancement of this field.







Abstract
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.

         <title>The Control of the Coordination Chemistry for the Genesis of Heterogeneous Catalytically Active Sites in Oxidation Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of coordination metal complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of fine chemicals is reviewed. Specific attention is paid to describing the phenomena leading to the genesis of the active sites, the clear characterization of the surface species, and their catalytic performance.







Abstract
This Review provides a summary of the use and the role of coordination complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation reactions of interest for fine chemical synthesis. Specific attention is paid to the comprehension of phenomena explaining the formation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. Different families of coordination precursors are considered. For each example, a brief critical description of the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance is reported. Special attention is paid to the chemical environment of the first coordination sphere of the active metal centre. The catalysts obtained by heterogenization, grafting, or anchoring of homogeneous catalysts can therefore exhibit enhanced catalytic performance by merging advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The deposition of coordination complexes over a preformed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.

         <title>Rationally Designing Efficient Electrocatalysts for Direct Seawater Splitting: Challenges, Achievements, and Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of electrocatalysts designed for the direct splitting of seawater. The mechanism of seawater splitting is introduced before the primary principles for designing catalysts (noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free) for seawater splitting are analyzed in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The future development of electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen generation is also discussed.







Abstract
Directly splitting seawater to produce hydrogen provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. However, current seawater splitting faces many challenges because of the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, which makes it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This Review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles for designing catalysts for seawater splitting in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including with noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Furthermore, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.

         <title>Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8220;Unclear&#8221; Infection Imaging?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides summary and critical evaluation, including the challenges and pitfalls, of antibiotic&#8208;derived positron emission tomographic radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging either considered for radiotracer development for infection imaging or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization.







Abstract
The excellent features of non&#8208;invasive molecular imaging, its progressive technology (real&#8208;time, whole&#8208;body imaging and quantification), and global impact by a growing infrastructure for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are encouraging prospects to investigate new concepts, which could transform clinical care of complex infectious diseases. Researchers are aiming towards the extension beyond the routinely available radiopharmaceuticals and are looking for more effective tools that interact directly with causative pathogens. We reviewed and critically evaluated (challenges or pitfalls) antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging. We considered both radiotracer development for infection imaging and radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization; overall, a total of 20 original PET radiotracers derived from eleven approved antibiotics.

         <title>In Situ Inhibitor Synthesis and Screening by Fluorescence Polarization: An Efficient Approach for Accelerating Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>

In situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS) links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening tor target binding by fluorescence, as exemplified by the efficient identification of in vivo orally active inhibitors of PHD2, a target for anemia treatment.







Abstract
Target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a useful tool for hit identification, but has not been widely used, in part due to challenges associated with analyses involving complex mixtures. We describe an operationally simple alternative: in situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS), which links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening for target binding by fluorescence. We exemplify the ISISS method by showing how coupling screening for target binding by fluorescence polarization with the reaction of acyl&#8208;hydrazides and aldehydes led to the efficient discovery of a potent and novel acylhydrazone&#8208;based inhibitor of human prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a target for anemia treatment, with equivalent in vivo potency to an approved medicine.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage Carboranes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carbazole&#8208;modified carboranes emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). The |gPL| factors of (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in films reached 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3. Significant solvation effect was observed in the fluorescence and CPL of Cb1, while Cb2 showed remarkable AIECL effect with excellent ECL stability and dopamine detection ability.







Abstract
Herein, we report the structures of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carborane derivatives bearing carbazole chromophores that emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). By adjusting the substituent positions on the carborane derivatives, two chiral luminescent molecules, Cb1 and Cb2, with different properties were obtained. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors |gPL| of both (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in neat films were as high as 6.24&#215;10&#8722;3 and 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. Cb1 showed a deep blue emission peak at 434&#8197;nm in n&#8208;pentane. Interestingly, distinct fluorescence and CPL spectra were observed in solvents of different polarities due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect, suggesting its potential use in solvent recognition. Meanwhile, Cb2 exhibited good AIECL property, excellent ECL stability and could be used for determining dopamine concentrations, suggesting its potential applications in biology and diagnosis.

         <title>Isoxazole Nucleosides as Building Blocks for a Plausible Proto&#8208;RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotically plausible isoxazole nucleosides are shown to be excellent candidates for proto&#8208;nucleosides and proto&#8208;RNAs. The proto&#8208;nucleoside forms 2 instructive H&#8208;bonds with guanosine and can directly rearrange in RNA to give cytidine. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction is controlled by already present canonical seed&#8208;nucleosides.







Abstract
The question of how RNA, as the principal carrier of genetic information evolved is fundamentally important for our understanding of the origin of life. The RNA molecule is far too complex to have formed in one evolutionary step, suggesting that ancestral proto&#8208;RNAs (first ancestor of RNA) may have existed, which evolved over time into the RNA of today. Here we show that isoxazole nucleosides, which are quickly formed from hydroxylamine, cyanoacetylene, urea and ribose, are plausible precursors for RNA. The isoxazole nucleoside can rearrange within an RNA&#8208;strand to give cytidine, which leads to an increase of pairing stability. If the proto&#8208;RNA contains a canonical seed&#8208;nucleoside with defined stereochemistry, the seed&#8208;nucleoside can control the configuration of the anomeric center that forms during the in&#8208;RNA transformation. The results demonstrate that RNA could have emerged from evolutionarily primitive precursor isoxazole ribosides after strand formation.

         <title>Quantifying the Influence of Covalent Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding on Differing Reactivity of Trivalent Uranium and Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report experimental and computational studies that quantify the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent uranium and similarly sized lanthanides.







Abstract
Qualitative differences in the reactivity of trivalent lanthanide and actinide complexes have long been attributed to differences in covalent metal&#8208;ligand bonding, but there are few examples where thermodynamic aspects of this relationship have been quantified, especially with U3+ and in the absence of competing variables. Here we report a series of dimeric phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent f&#8208;metals that show how shorter&#8208;than&#8208;expected U&#8722;B distances indicative of increased covalency give rise to measurable differences in solution deoligomerization reactivity when compared to isostructural complexes with similarly sized lanthanides. These results, which are in excellent agreement with supporting DFT and QTAIM calculations, afford rare experimental evidence concerning the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of trivalent uranium and lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Conformational Effects on the Threading Kinetics of Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped Guests into the Cavity of Oxatub[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex kinetic behavior was observed in a two&#8208;component system containing a viologen&#8208;based guest and oxatub[4]arene through the involvement of the three conformers of the host. In addition, an unprecedented threading mechanism involving the tilted conformation of the guests was revealed to be responsible for the very fast kinetics and for the threading of guests with very large stoppers.







Abstract
Unprecedented threading kinetics were revealed between viologen&#8208;based guests and conformationally adaptive oxatub[4]arene. Three representative conformations of oxatub[4]arene are involved in the kinetic and thermodynamic products which follow the opposite orders in their rankings. Consequently, error correction was involved and a complex kinetic process was observed in a simple two&#8208;component system. Moreover, it was found that some viologen&#8208;based guests have much faster threading kinetics than those of DABCO&#8208;based with the same stoppers. This was enabled by an unprecedented threading mechanism in which a tilted conformation of the guests is adopted by involving one linear alkyl group on the 3,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl stoppers, the viologen core, and the methylene spacers in the transition states. This new mechanism even allows the viologen&#8208;based guests with the 3,5&#8208;dicetyloxybenzyl stoppers to form a pseudorotaxane with oxatub[4]arene.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of a XeIV Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4</title>

Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 react in CFCl3 solvent to form the first transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4. The complex was structurally characterized by Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, such as MEPS, show the W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond is primarily an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a smaller degree of covalent character.







Abstract
The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3 solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond. The XeF3 moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4 acquires a degree of [XeF3]+ character upon coordination that is reflected by its Xe&#8722;F stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4 and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 (M=Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MoOF4.

         <title>Engineering Support and Distribution of Palladium and Tin on MXene with Modulation of the d&#8208;Band Center for CO&#8208;resilient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosted electron interaction of metal nano&#8208;alloy with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites on PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 can modulate the d band center, decrease adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, thus removing CO poisonous intermediates, and thereby significantly enhancing methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) efficiency and durability of the anodic catalyst for a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).







Abstract
The efficiency of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is largely determined by the activity and durability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalysts. Herein, we present a CO&#8208;resilient MOR catalyst of palladium&#8208;tin nano&#8208;alloy anchored on Se&#8208;doped MXene (PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2) via a progressive one&#8208;step electrochemical deposition strategy. MOR mass activity resulting from Pd/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 catalyst (1046.2&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1) is over 2&#8208;fold larger than that of Pd/Ti3C2, suggesting that the introduction of Se atoms on MXene might accelerate the reaction kinetics. PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 with Se&#8208;doping progress of MXene and the cooperated Pd&#8722;Sn sites has a superior MOR mass activity (4762.8&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1), outperforming many other reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that boosted electron interaction of metal crystals with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites can modulate the d band center, reduce adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, resulting in highly efficient removal of CO intermediates by reaction with neighboring OH species on adjacent Sn sites.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Exposed Single&#8208;Ni Atoms with Potential&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behaviors for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>

An advanced electrocatalyst has been developed by decorating single&#8208;Ni atoms on hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS) for the oxygen evolution reaction. Thanks to the abundantly surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms, hollow S/N&#8208;codoped carbon matrix, as well as their strong synergistic interactions, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single&#8208;Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS). Specifically, the CdS@3&#8208;aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N&#8208;FCS. The gas&#8208;migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N&#8208;FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 56.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and ultra&#8208;long stability up to 166&#8197;hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of Ni&#8208;N4 sites and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Areal Density Single&#8208;Atoms/Metal Oxide Nanosheets: A Micro&#8208;Gas Blasting Synthesis and Superior Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) synthesis is developed to access versatile high&#8208;areal density noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Pt1/CeO2, Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. The as&#8208;prepared Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance than routinely structured alternatives by using water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) as a model reaction.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets are conducive to not only endow opened surfaces for loading active metal atoms but also boost the mass transfer for the heterogeneous reactions. The challenge is how to load and stabilize single&#8208;atoms on nanosheets in high&#8208;areal densities. This work reports an efficient micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) strategy to access versatile noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. Especially for Pt/CeO2 nanosheets (Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S), the Pt loading is increased to 15&#8197;at%. The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts from MGB are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance in the model reaction of water&#8208;gas shift (WGS). The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalyst exhibit 2&#8211;3&#8197;times reactivity that of their thicker counterpart, single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 microspheric catalyst. Moreover, the single&#8208;atom sites in Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S (1&#8211;10&#8201;%) catalysts are stable in a harsh WGS reaction condition of 10&#8201;% CO. This work thus paves a way to access the practical single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>New Insights into Physical Aging&#8208;Induced Structure Evolution in Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>

CMS membranes derived from polyimide precursors show dual model morphologies comprising a disordered continuous phase and distributed molecular sieving Langmuir domains. Our study showed that during physical aging, pore structure changes in the two different &#8220;C&#8221; phase and &#8220;L&#8221; domains both occur, which affects the gas separation performance of CMS membranes.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer the best available combination of scalable economical processability with excellent separation performance. Physical aging of CMS membranes causes pore structure changes over time that affect CMS membrane performance. To provide fundamental insights into the structure evolution in CMS membranes during physical aging, a combined dual&#8208;mode sorption and transport model is used in this study to characterize the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in fresh and 7&#8208;day vacuum aged CMS membranes. The results show physical aging of CMS membrane is primarily &#8220;diffusion related&#8221; and such aging behavior simultaneously causes ultramicropore changes in the continuous phase and Langmuir phase of CMS membrane. The new insights offered in this study suggest strategies to control the physical aging of CMS membranes and even use it as a valuable tool to tune the separation performance of CMS membranes for demanding gas separations.

A porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF) was constructed from a 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) derivative. Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen bonds of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with a bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through a Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.







Abstract
A rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.

Abstract
Dipolar coupled multi&#8208;spin systems have the potential to be used as molecular qubits. Herein we report the synthesis of a molecular multi&#8208;qubit model system with three individually addressable, weakly interacting, spin 
 centres of differing g&#8208;values. We use pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques to characterise and separately address the individual electron spin qubits; CuII, Cr7Ni ring and a nitroxide, to determine the strength of the inter&#8208;qubit dipolar interaction. Orientation selective Relaxation&#8208;Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (os&#8208;RIDME) detecting across the CuII spectrum revealed a strongly correlated CuII&#8208;Cr7Ni ring relationship; detecting on the nitroxide resonance measured both the nitroxide and CuII or nitroxide and Cr7Ni ring correlations, with switchability of the interaction based on differing relaxation dynamics, indicating a handle for implementing EPR&#8208;based quantum information processing (QIP) algorithms.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative&#160;Coupling of Difluoroalkenes and Aryl Boronic Acids for Ketone&#160;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction is a useful approach for ketone synthesis. But it is often problematic to use exogenous carbonyl reagents, such as the gaseous carbon monoxide. In this manuscript, we report a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids that yields bioactive indane&#8208;type ketones with an all&#8208;carbon &#945;&#8208;quaternary center. Characterization and stoichiometric reactions of the key intermediates RCF  2  Pd  II  support a water&#8208;induced defluorination and cross&#8208;coupling cascade mechanism. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an  in&#8208;situ  carbonyl precursor which is unprecedented in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. It is expected to raise broad research interest from the perspectives of ketone synthesis, fluoroalkene functionalization, and rational design of new synthetic protocols based on the unique reactivity of difluoroalkyl palladium(II) species</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoxides and sulfinamides represent versatile sulfur functional groups found in ligands, chiral auxiliaries, and bioactive molecules. Canonical two&#8208;component syntheses, however, rely on substrates with a preinstalled C&#8211;S bond and impede efficient and modular access to these sulfur motifs.&#160;Herein is&#160;presented the application of an&#160;easily prepared, bench stable&#160;sulfoxide reagent for&#160;one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component syntheses of sulfoxides and sulfinamides. The sulfoxide reagent donates the SO unit upon the reaction with a Grignard reagent (RMgX) as a&#160;sulfenate anion&#160;(RSO&#8211;  ). While subsequent trapping reactions of this key intermediate&#160;with carbon electrophiles provide sulfoxides, a range of tertiary, secondary, and primary sulfinamides can be prepared by substitution reactions with electrophilic amines. The syntheses of sulfinamide analogs of amide&#8208; and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drugs illustrate the utility of the method for the rapid preparation of medicinally relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium single&#8208;atom catalyst design through oxide support modulation for a selective gas&#8208;phase ethylene hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A frontier challenge in single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis is the design of fully inorganic sites capable to emulate the high reaction selectivity traditionally exclusive of organometallic counterparts in homogenous catalysis. Modulating the direct coordination environment in SA sites, via the exploitation of the oxide support&#8217;s surface chemistry, stands as a powerful albeit underexplored strategy. We report that isolated Rh atoms stabilized on oxygen&#8208;defective SnO2 uniquely unite excellent TOF with essentially full selectivity in the gas&#8208;phase hydroformylation of ethylene, inhibiting the thermodynamically favored olefin hydrogenation. Density Functional Theory calculations and surface characterization suggest that substantial depletion of the catalyst surface in lattice oxygen, energetically facile on SnO2, is key to unlock a high coordination pliability at the mononuclear Rh centers, leading to an exceptional performance which is on par with that of molecular catalysts in liquid media.</dc:description>

         <title>The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by a Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have proposed that a redox mechanism can produce surface charges and negative zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion. Graphite was kept in contact with a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution, washed, and exfoliated in water, resulting in a dispersion with lyophobic nature. Ammonia treatment did not provide functional groups or nitrogen doping to graphite. Moreover, this material was washed twice before sonication to remove most hydroxide. Therefore, neither functional groups, nitrogen atoms, nor hydroxide excess is responsible for the zeta potential. Kelvin probe force microscopy has shown that the ammonia&#8208;treated and exfoliated graphite has higher Fermi level than the water&#8208;treated material, indicating that the contact between ammonia and graphite promotes redox reactions that provide electrons to graphite. These electrons raise the Fermi level of graphite and generate the negative zeta potential, consequently, they account for the colloidal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three&#8208;component visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co&#8208;solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In&#8208;depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self&#8208;assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#160;s  &#8211;1  ) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest so far reported for Ru(bda)&#8208;based systems for photocatalytic water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Diels&#8211;Alder &#8220;Click&#8221; Strategy to Access Mechanically Aligned Main&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aligned liquid crystal polymers are materials of interest for electronic, optic, biological and soft robotic applications. The manufacturing and processing of these materials have been widely explored with mechanical alignment establishing itself as a preferred method due to its ease of use and widespread applicability. However, the fundamental chemistry behind the required two&#8208;step polymerization for mechanical alignment has limitations in both fabrication and substrate compatibility. In this work we introduce a new protection&#8208;deprotection approach utilizing a two&#8208;stage Diels&#8211;Alder cyclopentadiene&#8208;maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization to enable mild yet efficient, fast, controlled, reproducible and user&#8208;friendly polymerizations, broadening the scope of liquid crystal systems. Thorough characterization of the films by DSC, DMA, POM and WAXD show the successful synthesis of a uniaxially aligned liquid crystal network with thermomechanical actuation abilities.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Model of the Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is strongly considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish reduction kinetics from Li2S4  to Li2S during discharge hinders the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries. Although various electrocatalysts have been proposed to improve the reaction kinetics, the electrocatalytic mechanism is unclear due to the complexity of sulfur reduction reactions (SRR). It is crucial to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism thoroughly for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Herein an electrocatalytic model is constructed to reveal the chemical mechanism of the SRR in Li&#8211;S batteries based on systematical density functional theory calculations, taking heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon materials as an example. The adsorption energy of LiSy  &#8729; (  y  = 1, 2, or 3) radicals is used as a key descriptor to predict the reaction pathway, rate&#8208;determining step, and overpotential. A diagram for designing advanced electrocatalysts is accordingly constructed. This work establishes a theoretical model, which is an intelligent integration for probing the complicated SRR mechanisms and designing advanced electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tailoring Heterometallic Polyoxotitanium Clusters for the Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis is a promising yet challenging approach for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable oxygenated chemicals with O2 under mild conditions. In this work, we report an atomically precise material model to address this challenge. The key to our solution is the rational incorporation of Fe species into polyoxotitanium cluster to form a heterometallic Ti4Fe1 cocrystal. This newly designed cocrystal cluster, which well governs the energy and charge transfer as evidenced by spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations, enables the synergistic process involving C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen (1O2). Remarkably, the cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster achieves efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (C5 to C16) into aldehydes and ketones with a conversion rate up to 12,860 &#956;mol&#8226;g&#8722;1&#8226;h&#8722;1, 5 times higher than that of Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster. This work provides insights into photocatalyst design at atomic level enabling synergistic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Anionic Chemistry in Regulating the Reductive Stability of Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced electrolyte design is essential for building highenergy&#8208;density lithium (Li) batteries and introducing anions into the Li  +  solvation sheaths has been widely demonstrated as a promising strategy. However, a fundamental understanding of the critical role of anions in such electrolytes is very lacking. Herein, the anionic chemistry in regulating the electrolyte structure and stability is probed by combining computational and experimental approaches. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the solvents and anions in Li  +  solvation sheaths exhibit enhanced and decreased reductive stability compared with free counterparts, respectively, which agrees with both calculated and experimental results of reduction potentials. Accordingly, new strategies are proposed to build stable electrolytes based on the established anionic chemistry. This work unveils the mysterious anionic chemistry in regulating the structure&#8211;function relationship of electrolytes and contributes to a rational design of advanced electrolytes for practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) with arylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2&#8208;metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;&#8208;Pyranones with 1,2&#8208;Diaxes by&#160;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi&#8208;axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo&#8208;control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single&#8208;step construction of a new class of 1,2&#8208;diaxially chiral triaryl a&#8208;pyranones by&#160;an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene &#160;organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well&#8208;designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2&#8208;aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent stereo&#8208;control (most cases &gt;20:1 dr, up to 99:1 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system. DFT calculations have also been performed to discover and rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridine C&#8211;H Alkylation with Alcohols and Thiols via Single&#8208;Electron Transfer of Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified strategy for the deoxygenative or desulfurative pyridylation of various alcohols and thiols has been developed through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) derived from pyridinium salts and PtBu3. Mechanistic studies revealed that N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts serve as effective Lewis acids for the formation of FLPs with&#160;PtBu3, and the generated phosphine radical cation ionically couples with the in situ generated xanthate, eventually affording the alkyl radical through facile &#946;&#8208;scission under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction efficiency was further accelerated by visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method is conceptually appealing by using encounter complexes in FLP chemistry to promote SET, which provides a previously unrecognized opportunity for the selective heteroarylation of a diverse range of alcohols and thiols with various functional groups, even in complex settings under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;controllable Luminescence from Radicals Leading to Ratiometric Emission Switching via Dynamic Intermolecular Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photoinduced luminescent radicals with dynamic emission color is still challenging. Herein we report a novel molecular radical system (TBIQ) that shows photo&#8208;controllable luminescence, leading to a wide range of ratiometric color changes via light excitation. The conjugated skeleton of TBIQ is decorated with steric&#8208;demanding tertiary butyl groups that enable appropriate intermolecular interaction to make dynamic intermolecular coupling possible for controllable behaviors. We reveal that the helicenic pseudo&#8208;planar conformation of TBIQ experiences a planarization process after light excitation, leading to more compactly stacked supermolecules and thus generating radicals via intermolecular charge transfer. The photo&#8208;controllable luminescent radical system is employed for a high&#8208;level information encryption application. This study may offer unique insight into molecular dynamic motion for optical manufacturing and broaden the scope of smart&#8208;responsive materials for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Cytochrome P450 AbyV in the Final Stages of Abyssomicin C Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abyssomicin C and its atropisomer are potent inhibitors of bacterial folate metabolism. They possess complex polycyclic structures, and their biosynthesis has been shown to involve several unusual enzymatic transformations. Using a combination of synthesis and  in vitro  assays we reveal that AbyV, a cytochrome P450 enzyme from the  aby  gene cluster, catalyses a key late&#8208;stage epoxidation required for the installation of the characteristic ether&#8208;bridged&#8208;core of abyssomicin C. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of AbyV has been determined, which in combination with molecular dynamics simulations provides a structural framework for our functional data. This work demonstrates the power of combining selective carbon&#8208;13 labelling with NMR spectroscopy as a sensitive tool to interrogate enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions  in vitro  with no need for purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the High Salt Concentration Manipulated Evolution Mechanism on the Lithium Anode in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are promising candidates of energy storage devices. Both adjusting salt/solvent ratio and applying quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are regarded as effective strategies to improve the lithium (Li) anode performance. However, reaction mechanisms and interfacial properties in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur (QSSLS) batteries with high salt concentration are not clear. Here we utilize in situ characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel aforesaid mysteries, and construct relationships of electrolyte structure, interfacial behaviour and performance. The generation mechanism, formation process, and mechanical/chemical/electrochemical properties of the anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are deeply explored. Li deposition uniformity and dissolution reversibility are further tuned by the sustainable SEI. These straightforward evidences and deepgoing studies will guide the electrolyte design and interfacial engineering of QSSLS batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiprocessing Quantum Computing through Hyperfine Couplings in Endohedral Fullerene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic molecules have shown great potential in quantum information processing due to the chemical tunablity of their quantum behaviors. Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time and rich energy levels were synthesized and studied to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing in quantum information using electron magnetic resonance. After initialization of the 12&#8208;levelled spin system, subgroups of spin energy levels coursed by the hyperfine couplings can be selectively manipulated. The cooperatively combining of the parallel calculations enabled quantum error correction, increasing the correct rate by up to 17.82%. Also, different subgroups of transitions divided by hyperfine coupling can be treated as independent qubits, and multi&#8208;task quantum computing were realized by performing Z&#8208;gate and X&#8208;gate simultaneously, which accelerates the overall gating speed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF  3  carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8208;CF  3  formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provided a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2% and good device stability that maintain 96% of initial efficiency after &gt; 1,300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic C4 Epimerization of UDP&#8208;Glucuronic Acid: Precisely Steered Rotation of a Transient 4&#8208;Keto Intermediate for Inverting Reaction without Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid (UDP&#8208;GlcA) 4&#8208;epimerase represents in special ways an important general problem of enzyme catalysis: the requirement to balance conformational flexibility with precise positioning for efficient reaction. The enzyme coordinates site&#8208;specific oxidation of the substrate by NAD  +  with coupled motion (rotation) of a decarboxylation&#8208;prone &#946;&#8208;keto acid intermediate in the active site, to enable stereo&#8208;inverting keto group reduction by NADH. We here reveal the elusive rotational itinerary of the emergent 4&#8208;keto&#8208;intermediate. Sugar ring distortion to boat conformations (  B  1,4  ,  5  S  1  ) induces torsional mobility in the constrained enzyme binding pocket. The low&#8208;energy rotational endpoints feature the 4&#8208;keto&#8208;sugar as undistorted  4  C  1  chair. With the carboxylate group placed equatorially stereo&#8208;electronic constraints are set to disfavor the 4&#8208;keto&#8208;intermediate decarboxylation. Epimerase variants give decarboxylation in the extent that they remove binding interactions with the carboxylate group in the opposite rotational isomer of the substrate. Substitutions R185A and R185D convert the epimerase into primitive UDP&#8208;xylose synthases that decarboxylate UDP&#8208;GlcA in completely stereospecific, configuration&#8208;retaining reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable High&#8208;temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Enabled by the Working&#8208;temperature&#8208;matching Palladium&#8208;Hydrogen Buffer Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The durability&#160;degradation during stack&#8208;operating conditions seriously undermines the lifetime and performance of fuel cell. To alleviate the rapid potential rise and performance degradation, herein, an ingenious&#160;anode design is proposed to match the working temperature of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with palladium&#8208;hydrogen release temperature and significantly enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity of Pd, achieving superior performance of Pd anode. Furthermore, Pd as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent layer in&#160;anode can provide additional in&#8208;situ&#160;hydrogen and absorb infiltrated oxygen during local fuel starvation to maintain HOR and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with the traditional unitary Pt/C anode, the Pd/C anode greatly improved HT&#8208;PEMFCs durability during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation.&#160;The reversibility of hydrogen storage materials provides innovative guidance for improving the durability of PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Darobactins Exhibiting Superior Antibiotic Activity by Cryo&#8208;EM Structure Guided Biosynthetic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over recent decades, the pipeline of antibiotics acting against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is running dry, as most discovered candidate antibiotics suffer from insufficient potency, pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. The darobactins, a promising new small peptide class of drug candidates, bind to novel antibiotic target BamA, an outer membrane protein. Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo&#8208;EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32&#8208;fold, without observing toxic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Dimethyl Carbonate from CO2: Engineering Reactive Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria with Vacancy Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain chemicals is considered as a highly attractive way to produce value&#8208;added organics, while the underlying reaction mechanism remains unclear. Herein, by constructing surface vacancy cluster mediated solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), the 100% atom&#8208;economic efficient chemical conversion of CO2 to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is realized. By taking CeO2 as a model system, we illustrate that FLP sites can efficiently accelerate the coupling and conversion of key intermediates. As demonstrated, CeO2 with rich FLP sites show improved reaction activity and achieve a high yield of DMC up to 15.3 mmol/g. In addition, by means of synchrotron radiation in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy , combining with density functional theory calculations, the in&#8208;depth reaction mechanism on FLP site is systematically investigated, providing pioneering insights in the underlying pathway for CO2 chemical conversion to long&#8208;chain chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bi Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most promising CO2 utilization routes, the renewable electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Here, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0 A cm&#8208;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93% at &#8208;0.95 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80% and 67%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100 h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5 mol L&#8208;1 has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi0 clusters and Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi0&#8722;Bi2O2CO3 interface in CO2 activation and conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of free carboxylic acids represents a significant advance from conventional cyclopalladation initiated reactions. However, developing a modular synthetic platform for diverse quaternary and tertiary carbon centers based on this reactivity, two challenges remain to be addressed: mono&#8208;selectivity in each consecutive C&#8211;H functionalization step; compatibility with heteroatoms. While the exclusive mono&#8208;selectivity was achieved by &#946; &#8208;lactonization/nucleophilic attack, the latter limitation remains to be overcome.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligosaccharides possess fascinating functions that are applicable in a variety of fields, such as agriculture. However, the selective synthesis of oligosaccharides, especially chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides, has remained a challenge. Chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides activate the plant immune system, enabling crops to withstand pathogens without harmful agrichemicals. Here, we demonstrate the conversion of chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides using a carbon catalyst with weak acid sites and mechanical milling. The catalyst produces chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides with up to 94% selectivity in good yields. Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations indicate that our system preferentially hydrolyzes larger chitin molecules over oligomers, thus providing the desired high selectivity. This unique kinetics is in contrast to the fact that typical catalytic systems rapidly hydrolyze oligomers to monomers. Unlike other materials carbons more strongly adsorb large polysaccharides than small oligomers, which is suitable for the selective synthesis of small oligosaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in a Fe(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover Fe(II) molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3 T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4 mC/m2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled Identification of 4&#8208;Oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactams as Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidases 8 and 9</title>

         <dc:description>
Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of branched allylic phosphine compounds under mild conditions is reported. Products bearing various functional groups can be synthesized with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99.9% ee) and regioselectivity. The employment of phosphine sulfides with relatively low deactivation capacity against metal catalysts is crucial for the success of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired patterns of PTM into histone H3 on nucleosome in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of an Alternate Charge&#8208;Polarization State in a One&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8211;Pt&#8211;I Chain Compound with a Bulky Pendant Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) exhibits various electronic states based on a mixed&#8208;valence metal&#8208;dimer system. This report deals with the synthesis and physical properties of a new MMX&#8208;chain with a bulky pendant ligand, Pt  2  (mc  c  &#8208;HexCS  2  )  4  I (mc  c  &#8208;HexCS  2  =  trans  &#8208;4&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)cyclohexanedithiocarboxylate). The steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituent induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving at ambient condition the first pure alternate charge&#8208;polarization (ACP) state (&#8211;Pt  2+  &#8211;Pt  3+  &#8211;I  &#8722;  &#8211;Pt  3+  &#8211;Pt  2+  &#8211;I  &#8722;  &#8211;), a kind of spin&#8208;Peierls state, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and its conducting and magnetic properties. The strain effect is also manifested as a very large linear thermal expansion along the chain direction, which is quite different from conventional MMX&#8208;chains without a bulky ligand. The design of low&#8208;dimensional materials with ligand variations is expected to lead to the emergence of new electron&#8211;lattice coupled electronic states.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a Ferryl Flip in Electronically Tuned Nonheme Complexes. Consequences in Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two oxoiron(IV) isomers ( R2a and  R2b) of general formula [FeIV(O)(RPyNMe3)(CH3CN)]2+ are obtained by reaction of their iron(II) precursor with NBu4IO4. The two isomers differ in the position of the oxo ligand, cis and trans to the pyridine donor. The mechanism of isomerization between  R2a and  R2b has been determined by kinetic and computational analyses uncovering an unprecedented path for interconversion of geometrical oxoiron(IV) isomers. The activity of the two oxoiron(IV) isomers in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions shows that  R2a reacts one order of magnitude faster than  R2b, which is explained by a repulsive noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the substrate in  R2b. Interestingly, the electronic properties of the R substituent in the ligand pyridine ring do not have a significant effect on reaction rates, Overall, the intrinsic structural aspects of each isomer define its relative HAT reactivity, overcoming changes in electronic properties of the ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8212;layer by layer&#8212;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+&#160;core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton&#8216;s positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211066).

         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle et&#8197;al. present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions&#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. This behavior was observed in a new family of squaramides that self&#8208;assemble into particles at room temperature and undergo a reversible morphological transformation into fibers by cooling the sample.&#160;This transformation is triggered by a molecular rearrangement of the aggregated system implying a change in the squaramide hydrogen bonding pattern.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

         <dc:description>
Spectral tuning, from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209670).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Formation and Rotation of Magnetic Nanochain In Vivo for Precise Mechanotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systemic cancer therapy is always accompanied with toxicity to normal tissues, which prompts concerted efforts to develop precise cancer therapy strategy. Herein, we firstly develop an intriguing approach that enables spatiotemporally controlled formation and rotation of magnetic nanochains  in vivo,  allowing for precise mechanotherapy of tumor with minimal side effects. The building blocks of the nanochain are hybrid nanocomposites of pheophorbide&#8208;A (PP) modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). By applying permanent magnetic field, the nanocomposites would be aligned to form nanochain. Next, MnO  2  NPs were subsequently administrated to accumulate in tumors as supplier of Mn  2+  , which effectively coordinates with the PP located at the joint the nanocomposite to immobilize the formed nanochains. In rotating magnetic field, the nanochains would rapidly rotate, leading to mechanical damage to organelles and cytoskeletons, and consequently resulting in apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, the IONPs and DCNPs showed high  T  2  &#8208;MR and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performances, respectively, which systematically facilitate to determine the tumor location and guide therapy. Overall, we represent a novel mechanotherapy strategy with great potential in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realization of practical sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered due to lack of compatible electrolyte components, dendrite propagation, and poor understanding of anodic interphasial chemistries. Chemically robust liquid electrolytes that facilitate both favorable sodium metal deposition and a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) are ideal to enable sodium metal and anode&#8208;free cells. Herein we present advanced characterization of a novel fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte utilizing the [HCB  11  H  11  ]  1&#8208;  anion. Symmetrical Na cells operated with this electrolyte exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 0.032 V at a current density of 2.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5% in half&#8208;cell configurations. Surface characterization of electrodes post&#8208;operation reveals the absence of dendritic sodium nucleation and a surprisingly stable fluorine&#8208;free SEI. Furthermore, weak ion&#8208;pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine&#8208;free sodium electrolytes</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonia Synthesis at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure from N2: A Boron&#8208;Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia, NH  3  , is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N  2  and dihydrogen, H  2  . This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating  ca  1.6% of the global CO  2  emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N  2  to NH  3  under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron&#8208;centered radicals provide a means of activating N  2  at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH  4  +  , the acidic form of NH  3  . EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N  2  functionalization by R  2  B radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabricating&#160;Industry&#8208;compatible Olefin&#8208;Linked COF Resins for Oxoanion Pollutant Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains formidably challenging to produce covalent organic frameworks (COFs) capable of large&#8208;scale synthesis and low cost to meet the industrial application demands (e.g., pollutant removal). Here we report using inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as building unit to produce a series of highly crystalline and robust olefin&#8208;linked COFs capable of industrial&#8208;scale fabrication by a melt polymerization method. This method not only breaks the dogma that the reactivity of 2,4,6&#8208;collidine is too low to serve as COF monomers, but also facilitates the kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis and formation of self&#8208;shaped monolithic robust foams. The afforded COFs possess extremely low cost (&lt;50 USD/kg), superior to all the reported COFs. More importantly, using one&#8208;pot or post&#8208;modification methods can conveniently transform neutral COFs to ionic COFs, which can be applied as highly efficient ion&#8208;exchange sorbents for scavenging oxoanion pollutants with fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity, and ultra&#8208;low swelling performance. Remarkably, the superior adsorption capacity of a model oxoanion (ReO  4  &#8208;  ) is the highest among crystalline porous materials reported so far. This work not only expands the scopes of olefin&#8208;linked COFs but also enlightens the route for the industrial production of crystalline ion exchange sorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8217;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8217; untranslated region (5&#8217;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8217;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. All top&#8208;ranked 14 variants showed improved catalytic activity by 16.9&#8211;142.8&#8208;fold. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased by 1660&#8208;fold in kcat/Km, and 1.5&#8722;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7 V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system&#160;due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility&#160;between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development.&#160;Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for&#160;realizing&#160;4.7 V resistant&#160;SMBs electrolyte with&#160;NaClO4&#160;and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS)&#160;as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8208;&#160;can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+&#160;to&#160;form&#160;stable polymer&#8208;like chains&#160;with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8208;&#160;anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases.&#160;Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75 V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F&#160;(NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% after 500 cycles&#160;at 4.7 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#697;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to previous approaches to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids that based on reactions using hazardous gases, pressurized setup and mostly noble metal catalysts, in this work, a nickel&#8208;catalysed general, efficient and highly enantioselective carboxylation reaction of racemic benzylic (pseudo)halides under mild conditions using atmospheric CO2  has been developed. A unique chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligand named Me&#8208;SBpy featuring compact polycyclic skeleton enabled both high reactivity and stereoselectivity. The utility of this method has been demonstrated by synthesis of various chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids (30 examples, up to 95% yield and 99:1 er), including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and transformations using the acids as key intermediates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to previous approaches to chiral &#945;-aryl carboxylic acids that based on reactions using hazardous gases, pressurized setup and mostly noble metal catalysts, in this work, a nickel-catalysed general, efficient and highly enantioselective carboxylation reaction of racemic benzylic (pseudo)halides under mild conditions using atmospheric CO2  has been developed.

         <title>&#928;&#8208;Expanded Carbazoles as Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;selective materials for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often possess small dipoles which prohibit them from effectively modulating the workfunction of ITO substrate, limiting the PSC photovoltage. Moreover, their properties can be drastically affected by even subtle structural modifications, undermining the final PSC performance. Here, we designed two carbazole&#8208;derived SAMs, CbzPh and CbzNaph through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion for improved molecular dipole moment and strengthened p&#8208;p interaction. The helical &#960;&#8208;expanded CbzNaph has the largest dipole, forming densely packed and ordered monolayer, facilitated by the highly ordered assembly observed in its p&#8208;scaffold's single crystal. These synergistically modulate the perovskite crystallization atop and tune the ITO workfunction. Consequently, the champion PSC employing CbzNaph showed an excellent 24.1% efficiency and improved stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Compacting Electric Double Layer Enables Carbon Electrode with Ultrahigh Zn Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based cathodes for aqueous zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) typically undergo low Zn ion storage capability due to their electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) energy storage mechanism that is restricted by specific surface area and thickness of electric double layer (EDL). Here, we report a universal surface charge modulation strategy to effectively enhance the capacitance of carbon materials by decreasing the thickness of EDL. Amino groups with lone pair electrons were chosen to increase the surface charge density and enhanced the interaction between carbon electrode and Zn ions, thus effectively compacting the EDL. Consequently, amino functionalized porous carbon based ZHSCs can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2 mAh g&#8208;1 along with excellent cycling stability (95.5% capacity retention after 50000 cycles) in 1M ZnCl2 electrolyte. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EDL modified carbon as Zn2+ storage cathode and great prospect for constructing high performance ZHSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Green &amp; Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. Decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) for this family of emitters, with a EQEmax of 30.8% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551 nm and 16.7% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 613 nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L = pmdta; 2: L = crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds&#160;=&#160;hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped.  Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Properties of High Nitrogen Content Carbonaceous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. A collection of carbonaceous materials with different pore networks and high nitrogen content was characterized and used to catalyze four reactions to deduce structure&#8208;activity relationships. The CO2 cycloaddition and Knoevenagel reaction depend on Lewis basic sites (electron&#8208;rich nitrogen species). The absence of large conjugated carbon domains resulting from the introduction of large amounts of nitrogen in the carbon network is responsible for poor redox activity, as observed through the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene with hydrazine and the catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine using hydroperoxide. The material with the highest activity towards Lewis acid catalysis (in the hydrolysis of (dimethoxymethyl)benzene to benzaldehyde) is the most effective for small molecule activation and presents the highest concentration of electron&#8208;poor nitrogen species.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine Assisted MnO2 Dissolution Chemistry: Toward a Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density of over 300 Wh L&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+/Mn3+ redox pair has been considered as a promising cathode for high energy density batteries, due to its attractive features of high redox potential, solubility and outstanding kinetics. However, the disproportionation side reaction of Mn3+, which results in accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 limits its reversibility and further energy density. Herein, a novel catholyte based on mixture of Mn2+ and Br&#8208; was proposed for flow batteries with high energy density and long cycle life. In the design, the &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 can be fully discharged via Br&#8208; by a chemical&#8208;electrochemical reaction. Coupled with Cd/Cd2+ as anode, the assembled Bromine&#8208;Manganese flow battery (BMFB) demonstrates a high energy efficiency of 76% at 80 mA cm&#8208;2 with energy density of 360 Wh L&#8722;1. The battery assembled with silicotungstic acid as anode could continuously run for over 2000 cycles at 80 mA cm&#8208;2. With high power density, energy density and durability, the BMFB shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Screening for Cu&#8208;based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts: Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to C2+ Products on Magnesium&#8208;Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2  (CO2  RR) into high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive route to achieve carbon neutralization. However, the development of an efficient catalyst for CO2  RR is still largely by trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and is very time&#8208;consuming. Herein, we bulid an electrocatalyst testing platform featuring a home&#8208;built automatic flow cell to accelarate the discovery of efficient catalysts. A fast screening of 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts in only ~55 h identifies the Mg combined with Cu as the best electrocatalyst for CO2  to C2+  products. The thus designed Mg&#8208;Cu catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+  products up to 80% with a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8208;2  at &#8208;0.77 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Systematic experiments with  in&#8208;situ  spectroelectrochemistry analyses unravel that Mg2+  species stabilizes Cu+  sites during CO2  RR and promotes the CO2  activation, thus enhancing the *CO coverage to promote C&#8208;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Atomic Pairs with a Distal Fe3+&#8208;Site Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8722;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair, bound to a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Lewis acidic Fe center as the distal to the surface, boosted water oxidation. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies
</title>

         <dc:description>
New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

&lt;p&gt;New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non-reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head-to-tail&#8221; pseudo-hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure-activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure-activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head-to-tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non-reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) with similar structure-activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head-to-tail linked pseudo-oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful to studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono-sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound-responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.

&lt;p&gt;The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns.

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization

The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as the electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries application.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo&#8208;oligomerization; 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of stacked aromatic assemblies has been developed, in which the remote heteroannular site over the proximal homoannular site is functionalized. Mechanistic investigations support an olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversification of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular ortho C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.

Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination-promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirosilabicyclohexenes by Asymmetric Dual Ring Expansion of Spirosilabicyclobutane with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirosilabicyclobutanes undergoes asymmetric dual ring expansion with alkynes to provide homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;disubstituted spirosilabicyclohexenes, possessing axially chiral 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework, in good yields with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Silaspiranes have attracted particular attention due to their chiral spiro&#8208;silicon center, which serves as an ideal carbon isostere and can endow spiro&#8208;analogs with distinct properties. Distinct from previously reported cyclization or cycloaddition strategies to form 5/5&#8208;silaspiranes, we report herein the asymmetric dual ring expansion of spirosilabicyclobutanes with alkynes to synthesize axially chiral spirosilabicyclohexenes bearing a novel 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework. DFT (density functional theory) calculations provide the deep insight into the origin of the high enantioselectivity controlled by the sterically demanding binaphthyl phosphoramidite ligand. Preliminary studies of chiroptical properties indicate that one of the spirosilabicyclohexene analogs exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) activity.

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) has been studied at the liquid&#8208;solid interface to elucidate its polymorphism in a monolayer and the facile formation of the stacked layer. The study of the intrinsic electronic structures of the stacked bilayer by scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.







Abstract
Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of their novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05&#8197;mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations &gt;0.2&#8197;mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked bilayer generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by about 20&#8201;% compared with the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;state long&#8208;lived emission has been obtained by regulating the molecular motions of star&#8208;shaped molecules. Reverse intersystem crossing assisted by the T2 state of the star&#8208;shaped molecules leads to thermally activated delayed fluorescence in solution and the solid state. Suppressing the molecular motions of the dye in a polymer leads to ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) are rationally designed and fabricated through efficient tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches. Benefiting from the distinctive hollow structures, Cu substitution, and Mn vacancies, the CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs electrode shows improved Zn ion storage properties with high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N6 octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Parent Core Engineering for Six&#8208;Level System Lasing Toward 900 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low lasing threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 through engineering of the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) parent core. This work demonstrates that extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core can effectively enhance the second proton transfer process in a cascaded double ESIPT system.







Abstract
Organic molecules which can undergo excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process have been considered as ideal gain materials for near&#8208;infrared organic lasers owing to their effective four&#8208;level systems. However, extending lasing wavelength beyond 800&#8197;nm with present ESIPT&#8208;active gain materials is still in challenge. Herein, we established a molecular design strategy that operates via extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core to enhance the cascaded double ESIPT process and thus to achieve the red&#8208;shifted six&#8208;level system lasing. Concretely, a model molecule with 1,9&#8208;dihydroxyanthracene as the ESIPT parent core was designed and synthesized, which was proved to undergo twice cascaded ESIPT processes while the 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;based analogue can only undergo once ESIPT process based on DFT calculations and ultrafast dynamics analyses. Finally, a six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Finally, a six-level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coplanar strategy using indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) simultaneously achieves narrowed emission and ultraviolet (UV) emission in fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and a synthetic shortcut is carried out to efficiently obtain the target coplanar ICZ derivatives. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) shows UV emission with peaks below 400&#8197;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) both in photoluminescence and electroluminescence, achieving best results among fluorescent UV&#8208;OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it's still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26&#8201;% peaks @ 388&#8197;nm and 4.02&#8201;% peaks @ 406&#8197;nm with small FWHM of 32&#8197;nm and 46&#8197;nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Fluorinated Tetraarylethenes: Universal Tags for the Synthesis of Solid State Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for the coupling of fluorinated tetraarylethens to a wide range of substrates is described. The approach allows converting amino acids, bioactive compounds, carbohydrates, steroids, and polymers in one step into solid state luminogens.







Abstract
The aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of tetraarylethenes (TAEs) have led to numerous applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Herein, we describe two fluorinated tetraarylethenes, which can be employed as universal tags for the synthesis of solid state luminogens. The tags are accessible in one or two steps from commercially available starting materials. Facile coupling reactions with ubiquitous substrates such as thiols, alcohols, amines, phosphines, aldehydes, and enamines allow preparing a wide range of TAE conjugates, including tagged amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids, and commercial polymers.

         <title>Discovery of a Thioxanthone&#8211;TfOH Complex as a Photoredox Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Alkenes Using p&#8208;Xylene as both Electron and Hydrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic photoredox catalyst was discovered by simply adding a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst to readily available thioxanthone. The new catalyst, 9&#8208;HTXTF, shows a sufficiently long singlet lifetime and adequately strong oxidation potential, as well as relatively facile photoexcitation, with applications in the hydrogenation and deuteration of carbonylated alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of alkenes is one of the most fundamental transformations in organic synthesis, and widely used in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Although numerous hydrogenation methods have been developed, novel types of catalysis with new mechanisms and new hydrogen sources are still desirable. Thioxanthone (TX) is widely used in energy&#8208;transfer photoreactions, but rarely in photoredox processes. Herein we show that a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst can tune the properties of TX to make it a photoredox catalyst with highly enhanced oxidative capability in the hydrogenation of carbonylated alkenes with the cheap petroleum industrial product p&#8208;xylene serving as the hydrogen source. Deuterium can also be introduced by this method by using D2O as the D source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using p&#8208;xylene as a hydrogen source.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactive single crystals of bis(indandione) derivatives were carefully functionalized by controlling side chain length as well as introducing different end groups on the side chains. While maintaining topochemical reactivities, modifying side chains can significantly affect polymerization kinetics and enhance polymer elastic modulus. Furthermore, polymer single crystals could be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust thin films.







Abstract
Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando laboratory&#8208;based multi&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) offers possibilities for advanced catalyst characterization, as demonstrated for mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts consisting of Ni, Cu, and Fe. Synergistic effects during catalyst reduction and their influence on catalytic performance were unraveled, guiding rational design of multielement solid catalysts for various applications.







Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and especially X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) offers new opportunities in catalyst characterization and presents not only an alternative, but also a complementary approach to precious beamtime at synchrotron facilities. We successfully designed a laboratory&#8208;based setup for performing operando, quasi&#8208;simultaneous XANES analysis at multiple K&#8208;edges, more specifically, operando XANES of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts containing Ni, Fe, and Cu. Detailed operando XANES studies of the multielement solid catalysts revealed metal&#8208;dependent differences in the reducibility and re&#8208;oxidation behavior and their influence on the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The applicability of operando laboratory&#8208;based XANES at multiple K&#8208;edges paves the way for advanced multielement catalyst characterization complementing detailed studies at synchrotron facilities.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Oxygenation: Catalytic Enantioselective Formation of Five&#8208;Membered Cyclic Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohol feedstocks is presented. The method exploits an unusual nitrene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H oxygenation via a proposed 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95&#8201;% and with up to 99&#8201;% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H oxygenation which includes an unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrene intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translocation of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) between two catalytic domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) has been studied for the first time. Monitoring PCP interaction with A and C domains during catalysis using two FRET sensors of an elongation module revealed conformational population shifts that correlate with the directionality of synthesis. The first light&#8208;controlled NRPS was created to further probe and support this model.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for the assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8901;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated and molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystal (PHGC&#8208;1) made of cucurbit[8]uril and trimethoxybenzylazaphosphatrane can adsorb iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of a)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, b)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and c)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are very attractive attributes of this new generation of energy&#8208;saving porous materials.







Abstract
Recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) with radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, (ii)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and (iii)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decreasing the energy costs. 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY were instrumental for monitoring the H2O/I2 exchange. PHGC&#8208;1 crystals are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2&#8208;doped crystals showed markedly different second harmonic generation (SHG), which suggests that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Cluster Embedded Necklace&#8208;Shaped Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like nanohoops with an embedded carborane have been synthesized. The nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission properties, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90&#8201;% and a high solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency (87.3&#8201;%), which offer applications in OLEDs and bioimaging.







Abstract
The combination of carbon&#8208;based nanohoops with other functional organic molecular structures should lead to the design of new molecular configurations with interesting properties. Here, necklace&#8208;like nanohoops embedded with carborane were synthesized for the first time. The unique deboronization of o&#8208;carborane has led to the facile preparation of ionic nanohoop compounds. Nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90.0&#8201;% in THF and a solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency of 87.3&#8201;%, which opens an avenue for the applications of the nanohoops in OLEDs and bioimaging.

         <title>Synchronizing Two Distinct Nano&#8208;Circular Sliding Motions in Six&#8208;Component Machinery for Double Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The speed synchronization of two slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck systems, each activating a catalytic unit through circular motion, leads to synergistic effects in the catalytic turnover of a double catalysis.







Abstract
The heteroleptic multi&#8208;component double slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck system DS3 exhibits tight coupling of motional speed of two distinct nano&#8208;circular sliders (k298=77 and 41&#8197;kHz) despite a 2.2&#8197;nm separation. In comparison, the single sliders in DS1 and DS2 move at vastly different speed (k298=1.1 vs. 350&#8197;kHz). Synchronization of the motions in DS3 remains even when one slows the movement of the faster slider using small molecular brake pads. In contrast to the individual DS1 and DS2 systems, DS3 is a powerful catalyst for a two&#8208;step reaction by using the motion of both sliders to drive two catalytic processes.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, 2&#8208;chlorothioxanthone (2&#8208;CTX) triplet energy sensitization of simple acrylamides enables facile access to a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products. The reaction proceeds through triplet sensitization of the C&#8722;C olefin moiety and features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization through a biradical carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. The proposed mechanism is supported by deuterium labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;azetidinones (&#946;&#8208;lactams) from simple acrylamide starting materials by visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer catalysis is reported. The reaction features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via a variation of the Norrish&#8211;Yang photocyclization involving a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (supported by deuterium labelling and DFT calculations) and can be used for the construction of a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products.

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases usually perform a reversible 1,2&#8208;reduction of aldehydes to form the corresponding alcohols. Here we show how the active site of these dehydrogenases can be modified to perform 1,2&#8208;reduction of iminium moieties, as well 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium groups and 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.

         <title>Boosting Ethane/Ethylene Separation by MOFs through the Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of a pore engineering strategy based on isoreticular chemistry, an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with suitable pore confinement and more binding sites improved the ethane/ethylene separation performance compared to the parent MOF.







Abstract
Adsorption technology based on ethane&#8208;selective materials is a promising alternative to energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed a pore engineering strategy to tune the pore environment of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of the MOF. Introduction of amino (&#8722;NH2) groups into Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest&#8208;host interactions in confined pores. The NH2&#8208;functionalized Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has significantly improved one&#8208;step separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) productivity of 17.66&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 compared to 7.53&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accessible &#8722;NH2 groups on pore surfaces.

         <title>Cesium Amide&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8208;H Bonds with D2 and Application for Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) represents one of the most attractive labeling methods to synthesize deuterium&#8208; and tritium&#8208;labeled compounds. Catalytic HIE methods that enable site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H bond activation and exchange labeling with gaseous isotopes D2 and T2 are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals. As part of our interest in exploring s&#8208;block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe3)2 to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8211;H bonds with D2 gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8211;H bonds and D2 gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8211;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05% at &#8722;0.1 V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon Nanotube Binding Bis(pyrenylstyryl)BODIPY&#8208;C60 Nano Tweezer: Charge Stabilization through Sequential Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNT have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured bis(pyrenylstyryl)BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electron donor-acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNT have failed to reveal the much-sought long-lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi-modular DA hybrids capable of producing long-lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V-shape configured bis(pyrenylstyryl)BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;-stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump-probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60 .- -BODIPY-SWCNT .+  CS states of lifetimes in the 20-microsecond range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowed spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzymes distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic organisms organize discrete light&#8208;harvesting complexes into large&#8208;scale networks to facilitate efficient light collection and utilization. Inspired by nature, herein, synthetic DNA templates were used to direct the formation of dye aggregates with a cyanine dye, K21, into discrete branched photonic complexes, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) excitonic networks. The DNA templates ranged from four&#8208;arm DNA tiles, ~ 10 nm in each arm, to 2D wireframe DNA origami nanostructures with different geometries and varying dimensions up to 100 &#215; 100 nm  2  . These DNA&#8208;templated dye aggregates presented strongly coupled spectral features and delocalized exciton characteristics, enabling efficient photon collection and energy transfer. Compared to the discrete branched photonic systems templated on individual DNA tiles, the interconnected excitonic networks showed approximately a 2&#8208;fold increase of energy transfer efficiency. This bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy paves the way to create 2D excitonic systems with complex geometries and engineered energy pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enables Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a reactivity&#8208;tunable self&#8208;immolative design that enables activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC&#8208;responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC&#8208;targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self&#8208;immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineered a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring&#8208;open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We showed that a nitro&#8208;substituted self&#8208;immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interference. A highly efficient prodrug system was further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC&#8208;overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice. Our study provides a valuable paradigm for HDAC&#8208;targeted NIRF/PA imaging and prodrug release in vivo, highlighting its potential for bioimaging and drug development.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed PIDA&#8208;Mediated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Overriding Competitive Intramolecular Amination</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of amino acid derivatives has been achieved by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The N&#8208;SO2Py protecting/directing group plays a key role in enabling control of chemoselectivity (intermolecular C&#8722;O over intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation) and regioselectivity (favoring &#948;&#8208;CH3 over &#947;&#8208;CH2 activation).







Abstract
The selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of N&#8208;(SO2Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO2Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;&#8208;CH2. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.
