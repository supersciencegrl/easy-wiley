         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746 m2 g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 97.8 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1, which is five times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) of cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94%) and good FE (63%) of cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8208;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;free Anti&#8208;Perovskite with Strong Chiroptical Nonlinearity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Moreover, the anti&#8208;perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window , which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskites, R/S&#8208;MCN [(R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)6Cl(NH4Cl6 )] were constructed, and exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 800 to 980 nm. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.89 pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Most importantly, both R&#8208; and S&#8208;MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.60 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 71 mJ/cm2 , which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next&#8208;generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8211;S&#8211;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8211;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Operando Evolution of a Hybrid Metallic Alloy Interphase for Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency (CE) and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense, planar deposition Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Level Alignment at TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 Interface for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors suffer from high operating temperatures and poor selectivity. The TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (x = 0, 1, or 2) heterojunctions enhance sensing performance through energy level modulation. TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 detects NO2 at 1 ppb in &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature, exhibiting high selectivity and stability, thereby underscoring the role of energy band engineering in the advancement of sensor performance.







Abstract
Metal oxide (MO)&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors have great potential in environmental monitoring, security protection, and disease diagnosis. However, the thermally activated sensing mechanism in pristine MOs leads to high working temperature and poor selectivity, which are the main challenges impeding practical applications. Precise modulation of the band structure at the heterojunction interfaces of MOs offers the opportunity to unlock unique electrical and optical properties, enabling us to overcome these challenges. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable structures are promising materials for aligning the energy levels at the heterojunctions of MOs. Herein, we report the energy&#8208;level structural engineering of MO@MOF heterojunctions to optimize chemiresistive sensing performance. The interface was flexibly modulated from a straddling gap to a staggered gap by &#8208;NH2 functionalization of TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, varying x from 0 to 1 and 2, respectively. TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 combines the advantages of MOs and MOFs to synergistically improve gas&#8208;sensing properties. As a result, TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 is the first light&#8208;activated material to detect NO2 at 1 ppb with a response time of &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature. It also exhibited excellent selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. Our study underscores the potential of energy band engineering in creating high&#8208;performance sensors, offering a strategy to overcome current material limits.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized fluorogenic Seoul&#8208;Fluor (SF)&#8208;based tetrazine (Tz) probes with differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Through electronic modifications and quantum calculations, we elucidated the relationship between dienophile&#8208;Tz adduct structures and their fluorogenic properties. These probes enabled simultaneous multicolor bioorthogonal imaging of diverse cellular targets using a single probe.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite extensive research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of Tz&#8208;dienophile adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), a pyrimidine&#8208;rich DNA aptamer was isolated for PVS and PS microplastics, despite their different chemical structures. The high affinity of the aptamer for plastics allowed fluorescence&#8208;based microplastic detection.







Abstract
Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90&#8201;% cytosine and thymine but only 10&#8201;% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with a six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1&#8197;mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite (Sr/K&#8208;HEU) zeolite exhibits molecular trapdoor effect and thereby achieves inverse separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 with benchmark selectivity, which provides new thoughts for gas separation by zeolites and improves current understanding of molecular trapdoor mechanism.







Abstract
The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96&#8197;mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of Sr/K&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.

     alt="Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2-C2H2 Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sr-exchanged K-type clinoptilolite (Sr/K-HEU) zeolite exhibits molecular trapdoor effect and thereby achieves inverse separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with benchmark selectivity, which provides new thoughts for gas separation by zeolites and improves current understanding of molecular trapdoor mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K-type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K-HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation, showing the-state-of-the-art dynamic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dynamic uptake of 0.96&#8197;mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low-cost nature of Sr/K-HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three-dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K-HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate-keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations from the ten-membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules while excluding C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks by Implanting Cu Sites with Perfluorooctane to Accelerate CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously, though challenging. The authors presented an interesting CO2RR selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol by implanting Cu2O catalyst with C8F18 to regulate the hydrogen bonding networks, achieving FEethanol of &#8764;55.2&#8201;% and the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial noncovalent interactions. The 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of &#8764;55.2&#8201;%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent robustness over 60&#8197;hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O OIHs among the best&#8208;performing ethanol&#8208;oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene&#8208;preferred to ethanol&#8208;oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.

         <title>NADH Analogues Enable Metal&#8208; and Light&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogs that enable metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization of RAEs under ambient and open&#8208;air conditions. This approach offers simple operation without inert gas protection, metals and light, rapid reaction completion within 5 minutes from the easily preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates, diverse bond formation (C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;SCF3, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;CN bonds), broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), and synthetic utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization, making this strategy complement classical decarboxylative strategies.







Abstract
Here we report a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization approach enabled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogues. The efficient and operationally simple approach, conducted in 5 minutes from in situ preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates under open&#8208;air and ambient conditions, enables diverse bond formation and exhibits a broad substrate scope of over 70 examples. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and natural products further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this method. Combined experimental and computational studies elucidate the mechanistic pathway. These transformations streamline the synthesis of sp3 carbon&#8208;enriched compounds, adding a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Integrated with Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic desalination device integrates CO2 electroreduction, desalination, and oxygen evolution reaction to deliver outstanding Faradaic efficiency, fast salt removal rate (SRR), and efficiency, which is also applicable in natural seawater desalination.







Abstract
Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3&#8201;% for CO production at 288&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the highest salt removal rates of 1043.49&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99&#8201;% when natural seawater is used as the water source.

         <title>Elucidating Confinement and Microenvironment of Ru Clusters Stably Confined in MFI Zeolite for Efficient Propane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal in situ ligand protection combined with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere has been effectively utilized to encapsulate Ru clusters within MFI zeolites. The interaction between the confined Ru clusters and the MFI framework induces local strain, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment. This synergistic interaction demonstrates exceptional activity and unparalleled stability in the deep oxidation of propane.







Abstract
Achieving active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulating noble metal species within zeolites is highly promising for high utilization and cost efficiency in thermal and environmental catalytic reactions. Ru, considered an economical noble metal alternative with comparable performance, faces great challenges within MFI&#8208;type microporous zeolites due to its high cohesive energy and mobility. Herein, an innovative strategy was explored that couples hydrothermal in situ ligand protection with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere to embed ultrasmall Ru clusters anchored at K+&#8208;healed silanol sites (&#8801;Si&#8722;Ru&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;K complexes) within 10&#8208;membered ring sinusoidal channels of MFI. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the interplay between confined Ru clusters and MFI induces local strain in MFI, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment around the Ru clusters. This synergy interaction enhances alkane deep oxidation as the confined Ru clusters and the MFI microenvironment collectively pre&#8208;activate C3H8 and O2, facilitate the cleavage of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds at low temperatures. Notably, the stable geometric and electronic properties of the confined Ru show exceptional thermal stability up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, rivaling fresh catalysts. These findings shed vital methodological and mechanistic insights for developing efficacious heterogeneous catalysts for thermal catalysis.

         <title>Formation of H2O2 in Near&#8208;Neutral Zn&#8208;air Batteries Enables Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes show promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices but face slow charge kinetics. This study reveals a charge storage mechanism mediated by H2O2 formation during discharge and oxidation during charge, influenced by electrolyte composition and electrode material. Facile oxidation of H2O2 enables low overpotentials and suppresses carbon corrosion.







Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of near&#8208;neutral Zn&#8208;air batteries that is mediated by formation of dissolved hydrogen peroxide upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. This H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at ~1.5&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn, reducing charge overpotentials by ~0.2&#8211;0.5&#8197;V and mitigating carbon corrosion&#8212;a common issue in ZABs. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, contributing up to ~60&#8201;% of the capacity with ZnSO4 solutions and carbon nanotubes. Enhancing the H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway offers a route to higher energy efficiency and durability in near&#8208;neutral ZABs, advancing practical, sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Halide Cathode Materials Based on Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Reaction Towards All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LixFeXx+2 families were designed as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity cathode materials with 3&#8197;mol e&#8722; transfer based on the intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction mechanism, enabling the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs with improved energy densities.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with non&#8208;flammable solid&#8208;state electrolytes offer high energy density and enhanced safety. However, their energy densities are greatly limited by low&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity oxide cathode materials, typically relying on the intercalation&#8208;deintercalation mechanism with a catholyte content of 15&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Here we introduce the LixFeXx+2 (X=Cl, Br) families as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity alternatives, operating via a 3&#8197;mol e&#8722; transfer intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction. Notably, the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs using 95&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiFeCl3 active material delivers a remarkable capacity of 446&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 912&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which surpasses most oxide cathode materials. Of particular interest is the formation of amorphous Fe during the conversion process. The amorphous Fe exhibits high activity, catalyzing the conversion of LiX back to LixFeXx+2, which proves instrumental in realizing reversible intercalation&#8208;conversion reactions. These halide cathode materials represent a significant advancement towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.

         <title>Piperazine&#8208;Derived Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Bone Microenvironment</title>

Piperazine&#8208;based bisphosphonate&#8208;linked ionizable lipids for enhanced lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the bone microenvironment through systemic administration.







Abstract
Nucleic acid delivery with mRNA lipid nanoparticles are being developed for targeting a wide array of tissues and cell types. However, targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment remains a significant challenge in the field, due in part to low local blood flow and poor interactions between drug carriers and bone material. Here we report bone&#8208;targeting ionizable lipids incorporating a piperazine backbone and bisphosphate moieties, which bind tightly with hydroxyapatite ([Ca5(PO4)3OH]), a key component of mineralized tissues. These lipids demonstrate biocompatibility and low toxicity in both vitro and in vivo studies. LNP formulated with these lipids facilitated efficient cellular transfection and improved binding to hydroxyapatite in vitro, and targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment in vivo following systemic administration. Overall, our findings demonstrate the critical role of the piperazine backbone in a novel ionizable lipid, which incorporates a bisphosphonate group to enable efficient bone&#8208;targeted delivery, highlighting the potential of rational design of ionizable lipids for next&#8208;generation bone&#8208;targeting delivery systems.

         <title>Switchable Radical Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Olefins via Remote Hydrogen Atom or Group Transfer for Enhanced Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable radical polymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefins via remote hydrogen atom or group transfer is disclosed. This novel strategy enables the precise construction of a diverse array of polyethylene&#8208;based polymers with AAB or ABC sequences. The obtained polymer can be used as an interphase layer material in anode&#8208;free Li metal battery, which effectively improves the cycling stability of the battery and demonstrates its potential in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Introducing polar groups into non&#8208;polar polyolefins can significantly enhance the important properties of materials. However, producing polyolefin backbones consisting of polar blocks remains elusive, due to the substantial difference of reactivity ratios between polar and non&#8208;polar olefin monomers in radical polymerization or the poisoning of transition&#8208;metal catalysts by polar groups in coordination polymerization. Herein we present a practical way for the preparation of polyethylene&#8208;based polymers with distinct polar groups by radical polymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefins. A strategy of switchable remote hydrogen atom or group transfer is devised, leading to a diverse range of AAB or ABC sequence&#8208;defined carbon&#8208;chain polyolefins. The utility of these polymers is demonstrated by using poly(ethyl 2&#8208;cyanohept&#8208;6&#8208;enoate) (P2) as an interphase layer material in anode&#8208;free Li metal battery, which effectively improves the cycling stability of the battery and indicates its potential in energy storage applications.

         <title>Probing the Hidden Photoisomerization of a Symmetric Phosphaalkene Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch exhibiting degenerate photoisomerization. The research elucidates the isomerization mechanism using PC&#8208;EXSY NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and MRSF&#8208;TDDFT calculations. The work deepens our understanding of symmetric heteroalkene systems, opening new avenues for main group&#8208;based molecular machines.







Abstract
In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, and solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization experimentally for the first time. With a combination of photochemical&#8208;exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene, comparing it to two other known molecules belonging to this class. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light&#8208;induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.

         <title>Harnessing of Cooperative Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interactions for Luminescent Low&#8208;Coordinate Copper(I) Complexes towards Stable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular anagostic Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions are leveraged for the design of luminescent low&#8208;coordinate copper(I) complexes. Without using sterically bulky substituents on the carbene ligand, the copper(I) complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability. Featuring with high&#8208;efficiency and short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, the copper(I) complexes demonstrate exceptional electroluminescence properties with high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes are highly promising low&#8208;cost emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the exposed metal center in the linear coordination geometry makes them suffer from poor stability. Herein, we describe a strategy to develop stable carbene&#8208;Cu&#8208;amide complexes through installing intramolecular noncovalent Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. The employment of 13H&#8208;dibenzo[a,i]carbazole (DBC) as the amide ligand leads to short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances in addition to the Cu&#8722;N coordination bond. The resultant Cu(I) complexes exhibit yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 86&#8201;% and radiative decay rate constants on the order of 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Comparing with the analogues without Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions, the pincer complexes have significantly improved stability. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs show high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 29.5&#8201;% and extremely small roll&#8208;offs of only 3.5&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Remarkably, the operational lifetimes (LT90) are up to 68&#8197;h with an initial luminance of 3000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This work proves a feasible design of robust low&#8208;coordinate metal complexes by leveraging secondary coordination interactions, which helps to overcome the long&#8208;standing stability problem.

         <title>Bulk Stereoselective Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers by the Coordination of ZrCl4 with Tunable Spirocyclic Phosphoric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective polymerization of vinyl ethers was achieved using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid, featuring low catalyst loads, solvent&#8208;free, high tacticity control, and recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % m of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Squeeze Triggers Guest Desorption from Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ energy&#8208;intensive external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented energy&#8208;efficient guest release behavior from sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals by specific vaporized molecules &#8220;squeezing&#8221; the crystal surface to close the cavity voids and release the guest molecules.







Abstract
Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented molecular&#8208;squeeze triggered guest release behavior from sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals. The crystals function as typical sponge to include guest molecules within their microscopic voids that are adaptively formed, thus acting as adsorbents for toluene/pyridine separations. Intriguingly, vaporized ethyl acetate (EA) molecules trigger the guest release from the crystals without entering the pores or voids of the crystals to replace the guests. Instead, they work as external forces applied directly onto the crystals themselves, &#8216;&#8216;squeezing&#8221; the materials to close the voids through supramolecular interactions between EA and macrocycles on the crystal surface and release the guest molecules. Various experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the molecular&#8208;squeeze induced guest release procedure. The EA&#8208;regenerated crystals can be recycled multiple times without the loss of separation performance. Compared with conventional guest release procedure, this method is manipulated in a mild condition, showing the potential in saving cost and energy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and versatile rhodium&#8208;catalytic system has been developed to achieve selective arylation of arenes at the meta position with high regiocontrol, even on substrates that exhibit significant flexibility between the arene and the directing group. The total synthesis of SHP2 inhibitor CNBCA validates the synthetic utility of this methodology, particularly in contexts where flexible access to the meta position of an aromatic ring is required.







Abstract
The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8722;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation, meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;based directing group, in conjunction with arylboronic acids, selectively promotes meta&#8208;arylation with complete mono&#8208;selectivity. Despite significant advancements in meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, etc., meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, 5&#8208;phenylvaleric acid, 6&#8208;phenylcaproic acid, 3&#8208;phenylpropanol, and 4&#8208;phenylbutanol underwent meta&#8208;arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows to produce biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the meta&#8208;position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.

         <title>Stereoselective P(III)&#8208;Glycosylation for the Preparation of Phosphinated Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective P(III)&#8208;glycosylation reaction is established, proceeding by a nucleophilic addition and release strategy. With simple a &#946;&#8208;phosphino ester as the P(III)&#8208;transfer reagent, a series of anomeric phosphinated sugars are prepared efficiently and stereoselectively, and can be used in bioactive molecule conjugation, as chiral phosphine ligands or organocatalysts.







Abstract
Most of the reported work focus on the development of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, C&#8208; and S&#8208;glycosylation methods. However, no study explores P(III)&#8208;glycosylation reaction. Herein we describe a convenient protocol to realize P(III)&#8208;glycosylation process.

     alt="Stereoselective P(III)-Glycosylation for the Preparation of Phosphinated Sugars"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly stereoselective P(III)-glycosylation reaction is established, proceeding by a nucleophilic addition and release strategy. With simple a &#946;-phosphino ester as the P(III)-transfer reagent, a series of anomeric phosphinated sugars are prepared efficiently and stereoselectively, and can be used in bioactive molecule conjugation, as chiral phosphine ligands or organocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the reported work focus on the development of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation methods. However, no study explores P(III)-glycosylation reaction. Herein we describe a convenient protocol to realize P(III)-glycosylation process. A simple &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-phosphino ester is adopted as P(III)-transfer reagent for this new type of glycosylation via a nucleophilic substitution and release strategy. Diverse phosphine units are introduced to the anomeric center of various sugars efficiently and with excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this method is showcased by the prepared P(III)-sugars as novel linkers in bioactive molecule conjugation, new chiral ligands in metal-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions and organocatalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborated the designed P(III)-transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on C3N4: Minimizing Single Atom Pt Loading for Maximized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1 at%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8208;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8211; using this technique &#8211; a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03wt%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66 mmol/h/mg Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8212; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxetanes are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry applications, with demonstrated potential to serve as bioisosteres for an array of functional groups. Through the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox hydrodecarboxylation of 2&#8208;aryl oxetane 2&#8208;carboxylic acids this work enables access to the products of a [2+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition between alkenes and aryl aldehydes without the challenges associated with a traditional UV&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. Investigation into the hydrodecarboxylation mechanism reveals substrate&#8208;dependent modes of initiation under the conditions reported herein.

         <title>A Scalable Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Powered by Polycatenation Strategy for Efficient Acetylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) is a significant challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Pore space partition (PSP) has shown promise in enhancing gas adsorption capacity and selectivity by reducing pore size and increasing the density of guest binding sites. Herein, we firstly employ the 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy to construct a PSP metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy, incorporating functional N/O sites to enhance C2H2 purification. The polycatenated framework with optimized pore size and regularity, exhibiting significant improvements over traditional PSP MOFs by resolving the critical contradiction of balancing C2H2 uptake (98.5 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K, 100 kPa) and selectivity of C2H2/CO2 (3.4), C2H2/C2H4 (5.9), and C2H2/CH4 (96.4) in a MOF. Breakthrough experiments confirm high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt; 99.9%) and high C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures. Notably, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy exhibits excellent water stability, scalability, and regenerability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the strong binding of C2H2 is mainly attributed to the C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O/N interactions between host Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy and guest C2H2 molecules. The polycatenation strategy not only improved industrial C2H2 purification efficiency but also enriched the design diversity of customized MOFs for other gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Elelctrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58 nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlled synthesis of one-dimensional materials at atomic-scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small-molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long-chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub-nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic-layer surface composed of disordered, bonding-unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58 nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface-area of 189 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous-like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1 A&#183;mg&#8722;1, surpassing all reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire-structures at sub-nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oriented and Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly Monolayers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2&#8208;D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10% under standard illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Interaction Dynamics of an Enantioselective Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Acylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of a highly selective peptide&#8208;catalysed acetylation reaction using computations and NMR techniques sensitive to dynamics on the &#956;s to s timescale is presented. 13C&#8208;Relaxation dispersion measurements and 1H&#8208;CEST reveal differences in dynamics, providing insight into the molecular recognition of enantiomeric substrates by the peptide catalyst.







Abstract
Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods like carbon relaxation dispersion in the rotating frame (13C&#8722;R1&#961;) and proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (1H&#8208;CEST) are key methods to investigate molecular recognition in biomacromolecules and to detect molecular motions on the &#956;s to s timescale, revealing transient conformational states. Changes in kinetics can be linked to binding, folding, or catalytic events. Here, we investigated whether these methods allow detection of changes in the dynamics of a small, highly selective peptide catalyst during recognition of its enantiomeric substrates. The flexible tetrapeptide Boc&#8208;l&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;Me)&#8722;His&#8722;AGly&#8208;l&#8722;Cha&#8722;l&#8208;Phe&#8722;OMe, used for the monoacetylation of cycloalkane&#8208;diols, is probed at natural abundance using 13C&#8208;R1&#961; and 1H&#8208;CEST. Indeed, we detected differences in dynamics of the peptide upon interaction with the diol. Importantly, these differ depending on the enantiomer of the substrate used. These enantiospecific influences of the substrates on the dynamics of the peptide are rationalized using computational techniques. We find that even though one enantiomer reacts faster, as confirmed by reaction monitoring, the other is more tightly bound in DCM (as confirmed by 1H&#8208;saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements). These findings provide insights into the recognition of the substrates and explain the selectivity differences observed between the solvents toluene and DCM.

         <title>Doping Copper(I) in Ag7 Cluster for Circularly Polarized OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu were prepared in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield through precise substitution of the central Ag(I) atom in R/S&#8208;Ag7 with Cu(I), which not only triples quantum yield of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also doubles the CPL asymmetry factor. Solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) achieves the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high&#8208;yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu in 85&#8201;%&#8211;87&#8201;% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters R/S&#8208;Ag7, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90&#8201;%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07&#8197;eV) between S1 and T1 states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of R/S&#8208;Ag7 and R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%) in place of phosphorescence (15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;%). Relative to those of R/S&#8208;Ag7, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu due to accelerating ISC (intersystem crossing) and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8722;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7&#8201;%, which is superior to most of red&#8208;emitting OLEDs through solution process.

         <title>A Conductive Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Ribbon with High&#8208;Density Redox&#8208;Active Centers as Cathode for Stable High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive Cu&#8208;MOF featuring a coordination ribbon with high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers is constructed using DDA (1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) and double redox&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;O3N) via &#960;&#8208;d conjugation. As LIBs cathode, the resultant Cu&#8208;MOF could deliver a combination of high capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), impressive high&#8208;rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability.







Abstract
Conductive Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8208;MOF (DDA&#8722;Cu, DDA=1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination ribbon and high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers, making it a stable, high&#8208;capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox&#8208;active centers for enhanced lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu&#8208;MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8722;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

&lt;p&gt;A conductive Cu-MOF featuring a coordination ribbon with high-density redox-active centers is constructed using DDA (1, 5-Diamino-4, 8-dihydroxy-9, 10-anthraceneedione) and double redox-active centers (Cu-O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) via &#960;-d conjugation. As LIBs cathode, the resultant Cu-MOF could deliver a combination of high capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), impressive high-rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conductive Cu-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu-MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one-dimensional Cu-MOF (DDA&#8722;Cu, DDA=1, 5-Diamino-4, 8-dihydroxy-9, 10-anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;-d conjugated coordination ribbon and high-density redox-active centers, making it a stable, high-capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;-d conjugated Cu&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox-active centers for enhanced lithium-ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;-d conjugated Cu&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu-MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state-of-the-art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8722;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;in&#8208;Host Complexation: Activating Classical Hosts through Complete Encapsulation within an M9L6 Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latent host properties of classical, flexible organic macrocycles&#8212;previously considered incapable of guest binding&#8212;were effectively activated through &#8220;host&#8208;in&#8208;host&#8221; complexation within a large M9L6 coordination cage. This expanded cage thus can &#8220;empower&#8221; the classical hosts by providing complete confinement.







Abstract
This study reports a method for enhancing the functions and properties of traditional organic macrocyclic hosts by fully encapsulating them within a large M9L6 cage to form host&#8208;in&#8208;host complexes. Within the cage host, the macrocyclic organic hosts with electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings, such as cyclotriveratrylene and calix[8]arene, adopt specific orientations enhancing their inherent molecular recognition abilities. Due to the high crystallinity of the M9L6 cage, the guest encapsulation behavior of the host&#8208;in&#8208;host complexes can be observed by X&#8208;ray structural analysis.

         <title>Aliphatic Amines Unlocked for Selective Transformations through Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established state of knowledge, synthetically useful diazotation of aliphatic amines is possible. The key of this process is the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent. It improves the selectivity of the process and enables the transformation of the intermediates into the desired Friedel&#8211;Crafts products. In this way, after more than 150&#8197;years, also the diazotation of aliphatic amines is gaining its place in synthesis.







Abstract
While aromatic diazonium salts are important reagents in organic synthesis, &#8216;Diazonium ions generated from ordinary aliphatic primary amines are usually useless for preparative purposes, since they lead to a mixture of products giving not only substitution by any nucleophile present, but also elimination and rearrangements if the substrate permits.&#8217;1 In this work, we report that this statement is no longer valid, and it is now possible to control diazotization of aliphatic amines by utilizing isopentyl nitrite in HFIP. This transformation enabled electrophilic aromatic substitution with these highly abundant and commercially available alkyl reagents, as well as transforming them into building blocks typically employed in organic synthesis. The methodology opens an avenue for reactions involving aliphatic amines, even such demanding substrates as amino acids, as a source of carbocations thus expanding the degree of chemical space.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Manganese Bromides for Photoluminescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides exhibit switchable thermal quenching (TQ) and anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) behaviors, which strongly depend on excitation wavelength. For example, TQ behavior can be observed when they are excited at the peak and shoulders (direct excitation) of photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum while they exhibit undoubtedly anti&#8208;TQ behavior when excited at the valley (indirect excitation) of PLE or under X&#8208;ray irradiation from room temperature to ~400&#8197;K. These phenomena are proven to originate from the relative change of shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance and efficient Mn&#8208;ligand distance, which regulates the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates.







Abstract
One of the most significant challenges of luminescent materials is the thermal quenching (TQ) at high temperature. Understanding the correlation between crystal structure variation and photoluminescence (PL) quenching is significant to achieve anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) phosphors. Herein, we unveil a universal principle governing switchable TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides. We observed an abnormal anti&#8208;TQ phenomenon when phosphor is excited in the valley of PL excitation (PLE) spectrum (indirect excitation) while TQ phenomenon is observed when excited in the peak and shoulder positions of PLE. Our findings demonstrate that PL intensity is influenced by two variable parameters: the effective Mn&#8208;ligand distance and the shortest Mn&#8722;Mn distance. These excitation&#8208;dependent TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors originate from the relative changes in these distances, which modulate the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, as evidenced at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation. X&#8208;ray activated radioluminescence (RL) also exhibits anti&#8208;TQ behavior, which is analogous to the indirect excitation of PL evolution when excited at PLE valley. These insights bridge the gap between PL and RL properties in 0D manganese halides and offer potential avenues for developing advanced anti&#8208;TQ phosphors, efficient LEDs, and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Dynamic Hydrogen Isotope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As configurational entropy increases, bulky functionalities progressively block the apertures in sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, enabling programmable control over the pore structure. This controlled reduction in porosity enhances selective interactions with hydrogen isotopes. The gradual tightening of apertures directly impacts gas adsorption and separation performance, particularly in hydrogen isotope separation.







Abstract
Entropy&#8208;driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed&#8208;linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, that features two types of six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4&#8197;&#197; and 1.7&#8197;&#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3&#8197;times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature. This approach to entropy&#8208;driven pore engineering provides new opportunities for enhancing gas adsorption and separation processes.

         <dc:description>
A structurally novel polymer crosslinked by metal&#8211;organic coordination units (defined as metallopolymer) is designed and prepared to develop high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolytes (MPEs). By exploiting a Mo paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker, the organic and inorganic moieties of polymer skeleton are integrated at molecular level, without phase separation and local inhomogeneity. The coordinatively unsaturated Mo&#8801;Mo units in Mo(II) paddle wheel complexes can serve as Lewis acid sites to effectively bind to bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;), increase Li+ flux, and facilitate FSI&#8722; decomposition, resulting in uniform Li+ concentration gradients and the formation of stable fluorinated interfaces.







Abstract
The practical application of polymer electrolytes is seriously hindered by the inferior Li+ ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number (tLi+), and poor interfacial stability. Herein, a structurally novel metallopolymer is designed and synthesized by exploiting a molybdenum (Mo) paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker to bridge organic and inorganic moieties at molecular level. The prepared metallopolymer possesses combined merits of outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, as well as a low glass transition temperature (Tg &lt;&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C). Based on this metallopolymer, an advanced metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolyte (MPE) is developed for constructing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the unsaturated coordination of Mo atoms, the uniformly distributed Mo&#8208;polyoxometalates (Mo&#8208;POMs) in metallopolymer skeleton can effectively immobilize anions (bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions, FSI&#8722;) and promote the dissociation of Li salts. Moreover, dynamic metal&#8211;organic coordination bonds endow the MPE with re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing, enabling it to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. Consequently, the MPE achieves a competitive ionic conductivity of 0.712&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C), a high tLi+ (0.625), and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.0&#8197;V). This study presents a unique MPE design based on metal&#8211;organic coordination enhanced strategy, providing a promising solution for developing wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Integrated Catalyst ZnNC&#8834;PtZn for High&#8208;Performance Ethanol Electrooxidation and DEFC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integrated catalyst ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C, containing reactive centers of Zn&#8208;NxC nest&#8208; enclosed intermetallic compound of PtZn NPs, achieves a remarkable performance for ethanol electrooxidation with a mass activity of 3.7&#8197;A&#8197;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2&#8201;%, following the C1 pathway and the retention of initial activity remains 97&#8201;% after 5,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
We report here an electrocatalyst that exhibits superior performance in the electrooxidation of ethanol. The reactive centers of the catalyst have a nest&#8208;type configuration with outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest covering inner PtZn intermetallic compound nanoparticles loaded on carbon support (ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C). The high&#8208;energy stepped facets of the inner PtZn nanoparticles confined and shaped by the outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest is highly active for the critical C&#8722;C bond cleavage of ethanol in oxidation, confirmed by experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The catalyst shows a rare high&#8208;performance and demonstrates a mass activity of 3.7&#8197;A&#8197;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2&#8201;%, following the C1 pathway of reaction and the retention of initial activity remains 97&#8201;% after 5,000&#8197;cycles. The unique configuration, also mitigating the concentration polarization, endows the catalyst with innate ethanol electrooxidation property by inner&#8208;outer synergic interactions, leading to unexpected power output of an acidic direct ethanol fuel cell.

         <title>The Role of Electron Transfer in Copper&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes were used to elucidate the mechanism of Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. For electron&#8208;rich substrates, a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism is followed, whereas electron&#8208;poor substrates follow CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr).







Abstract
We report copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes supported by a pyridinedicarboxamide ligand (L) as a platform for investigating the role of electron transfer in C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. While the copper(II) trifluoromethyl complex is unreactive towards (hetero)arenes, the formal copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex performs C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide range of (hetero)arenes. Mechanistic studies using the copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex suggest that the mechanism of arene trifluoromethylation is substrate&#8208;dependent. When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF3 group transfer. Otherwise, a CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous and heterogeneous fluorescence with versatile colors were achieved on single crystals of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed bicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with permanent porosity. Focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy on single crystals reveal structure and property relationship.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of multicomponent molecules in a non&#8208;stoichiometric composition have drawn great interest due to their tunable properties. However, the photobehavior of the single crystals of such mixed HOFs has not been explored. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non&#8208;stoichiometric HOFs (NS&#8208;HOFs). NS&#8208;HOFs (BTNT&#8208;1) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores (NTTA and BTTA, respectively). The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy and local crystallographic analysis using focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray radiation. The versatile fluorescence of BTNT&#8208;1 behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratios, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. We provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. This work is the first example of single crystal studies applied to organic porous co&#8208;crystals and demonstrates unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid&#8208;based NS&#8208;HOFs. The results provide a concept of creating functional mixed porous materials capable of different and tunable optical properties.

         <title>Strong Magneto&#8208;Chiroptical Effects through Introducing Chiral Transition&#8208;Metal Complex Cations to Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral metal halide based on A&#8208;site chiral complex cation is synthesized, which provides a new strategy to construct the magnetic chiral metal halide. The influence of complex cation on the chiroptical and magnetic properties is systematically investigated. An ultrahigh modulation of over 500&#8201;% of apparent circular dichroism is achieved under 1.3&#8197;T magnetic field. The coupling between magnetic moment and chiroptical activity is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism.







Abstract
The interplay between chirality with magnetism can break both the space and time inversion symmetry and have wide applications in information storage, photodetectors, multiferroics and spintronics. Herein, we report the chiral transition&#8208;metal complex cation&#8208;based lead halide, R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. In contrast with the traditional chiral metal halides with organic cations, a novel strategy for chirality transfer from the transition&#8208;metal complex cation to the lead halide framework is developed. The chiral complex cations directly participate the band structure and introduce the d&#8208;d transitions and tunable magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects in both the ultraviolet and full visible range into R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB.

     alt="Strong Magneto-Chiroptical Effects through Introducing Chiral Transition-Metal Complex Cations to Lead Halide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiral metal halide based on A-site chiral complex cation is synthesized, which provides a new strategy to construct the magnetic chiral metal halide. The influence of complex cation on the chiroptical and magnetic properties is systematically investigated. An ultrahigh modulation of over 500&#8201;% of apparent circular dichroism is achieved under 1.3&#8197;T magnetic field. The coupling between magnetic moment and chiroptical activity is confirmed by the magneto-chiral dichroism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interplay between chirality with magnetism can break both the space and time inversion symmetry and have wide applications in information storage, photodetectors, multiferroics and spintronics. Herein, we report the chiral transition-metal complex cation-based lead halide, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB. In contrast with the traditional chiral metal halides with organic cations, a novel strategy for chirality transfer from the transition-metal complex cation to the lead halide framework is developed. The chiral complex cations directly participate the band structure and introduce the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; transitions and tunable magneto-chiroptical effects in both the ultraviolet and full visible range into &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB. Most importantly, the coupling between magnetic moment of the complex cation and chiroptical properties is confirmed by the magneto-chiral dichroism. For the band-edge transition, the unprecedented modulation of +514&#8201;% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB and &#8722;474&#8201;% for &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-CDPB was achieved at &#8722;1.3 Tesla. Our findings demonstrate a novel strategy to combine chirality with magnetic moment, and provide a versatile material platform towards magneto-chiroptical and chiro-spintronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Moir&#233; Lattice of Twisted Bilayer Graphene as Template for Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of the mori&#233; lattice formed by twisted bilayer graphene as template for non&#8208;covalent functionalization with HATCN molecules confirmed by Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree of non&#8208;covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with twist angles varying between ~5&#176; and 7&#176; was non&#8208;covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11&#8208;hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy, where areas with larger twist angles exhibited a lower HATCN peak intensity compared to areas with smaller twist angles. We suggest that the HATCN adsorption follows the moir&#233; pattern of tBLG by avoiding AA&#8208;stacked areas and attach predominantly to areas with a local AB&#8208;stacking order of tBLG, forming an overall ABA&#8208;stacking configuration. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir&#233; lattice in controlling the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials using moir&#233; structures as a template. This could facilitate the fabrication of nanoscale devices with locally controlled varying chemical functionality.

         <title>Unexpected Magnetic Moments in Manganese&#8208;Doped (CdSe)13 Nanoclusters: Role of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters synthesized with Se&#8208;NaBH4 and Se&#8208;urea exhibit distinct magnetic and photoluminescent properties. Se&#8208;NaBH4&#8208;derived nanoclusters demonstrate superior Mn2+ doping efficiency (12.3&#8201;%) compared to Se&#8208;urea&#8208;derived clusters, leading to exceptional magnetic moments (40&#8197;&#956;B at 180&#8197;K) and pronounced spin fluctuations.







Abstract
This study explores the enhancement&#160;in magnetic and photoluminescence properties of Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters, significantly influenced by the introduction of paramagnetic centers through doping, facilitated by optimized precursor chemistry and precisely controlled surface ligand interactions. Using a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthesis approach with elemental Se and NaBH4 (Se&#8208;NaBH4) in n&#8208;octylamine, we tailored bonding configurations (Cd&#8722;O, Cd&#8722;N, and Cd&#8722;Se) on the surface of nanoclusters, as confirmed by EXAFS analysis. These bonding configurations allowed for tunable Mn2+&#8208;doping with tetrahedral coordination, further stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetate ligands, as evidenced by 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. Mulliken charge analysis indicates that the charge redistribution on Se2&#8722; suggests electron transfer between surface ligands and the nanocluster, contributing to spin fluctuations. These tailored configurations markedly increased the nanoclusters&#8242; magnetic susceptibility and photoluminescence efficiency. The resulting nanoclusters demonstrated a clear concentration&#8208;dependent response in emission lifetimes and intensities upon exposure to magnetic field effects (MFE) and spin&#8208;spin coupling, alongside a large magnetic moment exceeding 40 &#956;B at 180&#8197;K. These findings highlight the potential of these nanoclusters for magneto&#8208;optical devices and spintronic applications, showcasing their tunable magnetic properties and exciton dynamics.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Asymmetric Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Unidirectional Low&#8208;Friction Water Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia leaves, an unidirectional hydrophobic membrane characterized by a hydrophilic rough surface and nm&#8208;sized hydrophobic internal pore channels is successfully synthesized. The low&#8208;frictional resistance within the synthesized asymmetric COF membrane&#8242;s pore channels is quantified using low&#8208;field NMR. Ultimately, the resulting COF membranes efficiently capture fog from the air while simultaneously filtering small molecular pollutants.







Abstract
Friction plays a pivotal role in many phenomena of physical chemistry and has long been in the focus of research thereof. As a crucial parameter, friction in membranes&#8217; inner and/or outer surface can be minimized to reduce solvent inlet resistance and enlarge inner pore fluid flux, ideally reaching near frictionless transport of water at nanoscale. Inspired by the leaf structure of Tillandsia, a porous membrane with a rough surface and a hydrophilic inlet together with hydrophobic pore channels was designed and fabricated, based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the as&#8208;made asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and enable inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in trapping fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate (WHR) of 1570&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated off in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of T. macdougallii. This work presents a practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport, and created a model paradigm to design fluid transporting pore channels.

         <title>Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger's Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Pd2L4 capsule based on Tr&#246;ger's base is reported and shown to bind several polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). It shows strong affinity for fullerenes C70 and C60 and is able to extract the latter from complex mixtures. Host&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer onto the fullerenes is observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and theoretically analyzed by sTDA time&#8208;dependent DFT methods.







Abstract
The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non&#8208;covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano&#8208;confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd2L4 capsule assembled from a C2&#8208;symmetric, &#8216;ribbon&#8208;shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger's base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700&#8197;&#197;3 volume. Fullerenes C60 and C70, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X&#8208;ray structures of host&#8208;guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD&#8208;DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.

&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric, &#8216;ribbon-shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger's base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; volume. Fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X-ray structures of host-guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD-DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rendering Proteins Fluorescent Inconspicuously: Genetically Encoded 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan Conserves Their Structure and Enables the Detection of Ligand Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiding in plain sight: 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan (4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp) renders proteins visibly fluorescent. Replacing a Trp residue with 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp inside a protein confers fluorescence without changing the surface structure; this can be used for microscopy, to measure ligand binding with subnanomolar sensitivity, and to detect proximity to the ligand. Systems are provided for genetic encoding of CN&#8208;Trp isomers, including 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp, in high yield.







Abstract
Cyanotryptophans (CN&#8208;Trp) are privileged multimodal reporters on protein structure. They are similar in size to the canonical amino acid tryptophan and some of them exhibit bright fluorescence which responds sensitively to changes in the environment. We selected aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases specific for 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp for high&#8208;yield in vivo production of proteins with a single, site&#8208;specifically introduced nitrile label. The absorption maximum of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp is distinct from Trp, allowing the selective excitation of its intense fluorescence. 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp fluoresces in the visible range with an intensity rivalling that of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;coumarin. Crystal structures of maltose binding protein demonstrate near&#8208;complete structural conservation when a native buried Trp residue is replaced by 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp. Besides presenting an inconspicuous tag for live cell microscopy, the intense fluorescence of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp enables measurements of subnanomolar ligand binding affinities in isotropic solution, as demonstrated by the complex between rapamycin and the peptidyl&#8211;prolyl isomerase FKBP12 furnished with a 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residue in the substrate binding pocket. Furthermore, 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residues positioned at different locations of a protein containing multiple tryptophan residues permits using fluorescence quenching experiments to detect the proximity of individual Trp residues to the binding site of aromatic ligands.

         <title>Vacuum&#8208;Assisted Confined Growth of MOF@COF Composite Membranes with Enhanced Hydrogen Permselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined growth of MOF into COF pores to prepare MOF@COF composite not only reduces the pore size of the COF membrane, but also forms a well&#8208;defined 1D nanoscale transport channel for gas permeation, thus significantly enhancing the molecular sieving property of the COF membrane for hydrogen separation. This synthesis strategy has been demonstrated with the formation of highly hydrogen permselective ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF and ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membranes.







Abstract
With ordered and periodic network structures, adjustable pore sizes and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have drawn much attention for the fabrication of superior separation membranes. However, it is challenging to prepare COF membranes with a molecular sieving property for gas separation due to their relatively large pore size. In this work, we develop the MOF&#8208;in&#8208;COF concept for vacuum&#8208;assisted synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 inside the pores of TB&#8208;COF formed from trihydroxy&#8208;benzene&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (T) and diamino&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;disulfonic acid (B), thus constructing a novel ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane. Attributing to the formation of a well&#8208;defined one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanoscale transport channel, the ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane displays a high hydrogen permselectivity. At 100&#8201;&#176;C and 200&#8197;kPa, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/CH4 and H2/C3H8 are 21.9, 63.1 and 134.4, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pristine TB&#8208;COF membrane due to the precise size sieving channels brought about by the incorporated MOF. The synthesis of ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membrane demonstrates the versatility of the synthesis strategy.

         <title>Polymeric Carbon Nitride Edged with Spatially Isolated Donor and Acceptor for Sunlight&#8208;Driven H2O2 Synthesis and In&#8208;Situ Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) grafted to carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. This process significantly facilitates the 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; WOR. Moreover, anthraquinone units with strong proton extraction capacity boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. In a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor, the generated H2O2 can be efficiently activated into &#8901;OH radicals, enabling the rapid degradation and mineralization of various organic pollutants under solar irradiation.







Abstract
On&#8208;site H2O2 activation attracts much attention in energy conversion and environment remediation et&#8197;al., yet remains challenging in its highly efficient and sustainable synthesis. Herein, we grafted a pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) in polymeric carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. Specifically, photogenerated electrons in the anthraquinone unit facilitate the 2e&#8722; ORR, while the methoxyphenyl unit, which gathers photogenerated holes, enables rapid 4e&#8722; WOR. More impressively, the anthraquinone unit also exhibits strong proton extraction capabilities to boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. Consequently, the synthesized donor&#8208;polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;acceptor (DPA) catalyst shows a remarkable H2O2 yield of 6497.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water, surpassing traditional DP and PA catalysts. Because of its high efficiency, the H2O2 product can efficiently degrade and mineralize various organic contaminants in a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor under sunlight irradiation. Our work presents an unprecedented approach to designing photocatalysts with efficient H2O2 synthesis and practical application from a molecular engineering perspective.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing formic acid (FA) as cationic solvent retards reaction rate and stabilizes I&#8722;, while further introduction of dithiothreitol (DTT) precisely modulates reaction&#8208;diffusion and crystallization kinetics through establishing a targeted interaction with SnI2, thus obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite film and highlighting the importance of kinetic balance. Ultimately, the DTT&#8208;incorporated device delivers the highest PCE of 12.68&#8201;% in a DMSO&#8208;free solvent by the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm2 device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale&#8208;up development of lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.

However, the high solubility of SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction-diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second-step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction-diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; between ligands and Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; significantly enhances the effectiveness of two-step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large-scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device among tin-based perovskite devices in two-step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale-up development of lead-free perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Functionalized Atomically Precise Metal Clusters Exhibit Synergistically Enhanced Performance for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise cluster catalyst (Ag9Cu6) integrated with alkynylferrocene (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc) was synthesized. This hybrid catalyst design facilitates continuous electron transfer, creating a unique chemical environment that enhances CO2 electroreduction. Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc achieves a CO Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% and a CO partial current density of &#8722;680&#8197;mA/cm2, significantly outperforming Ag9Cu6 without ferrocene functionalization.







Abstract
The integration of organometallic compounds with metal nanoparticles can, in principle, generate hybrid nanocatalysts endowed with augmented functionality, presenting substantial promise for catalytic applications. Herein, we synthesize an atomically precise metal cluster (Ag9Cu6) catalyst integrated with alkynylferrocene molecules (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc). This hybrid catalyst design facilitates a continuous electron transfer channel via an ethynyl bridge and establishes a distinctive local chemical environment, resulting in remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction. The Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc catalyst achieves a record&#8208;high product selectivity of CO Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level CO partial current density of &#8722;680&#8197;mA/cm2, surpassing the performance of the Ag9Cu6 cluster (62&#8201;% and &#8722;230&#8197;mA/cm2, respectively) without ferrocene functionalization in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Operando experimental and computational findings offer valuable insights into the role of ferrocene functionalization in synergistically improving the catalytic performance of metal clusters, propelling the advancement of metallic&#8208;organometallic hybrid nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.

         <title>&#8220;Angular&#8221; Spirocyclic Azetidines: Synthesis, Characterization, and Evaluation in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocycles: Spirocyclic azetidines serve as valuable isosteres of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. This work describes the first extended library of previously rare &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines, from synthesis protocols to structural, physicochemical, and biochemical properties.







Abstract
The previously neglected &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines have been synthesized, characterized, and validated in drug discovery. We have shown that these compounds could act as bioisosteres for common saturated six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Their incorporation into the structure of the anticancer drug Sonidegib (instead of morpholine), and Danofloxacine (instead of piperazine) provided novel patent&#8208;free analogs with similar physicochemical properties and high activity.

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8208;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8208; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7 A cm&#8208;2 with an energy efficiency of 62%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports&#160;for selective NO3&#8208; reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Engineering of MOF Nanosheets for Accelerated Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying the separator is considered as an effective strategy for achieving High performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, most modification layers are excessively thick, with catalytic active sites primarily located within the material's interior. This configuration severely impacts Li+ transport and the efficient catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a multifunctional separator that integrates ultrathin design, catalytic activity, and ion sieving capabilities. Herein, we successfully linked TCPP(Ni) as a secondary ligand with Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets to create an ultra&#8208;thin separator modification layer (Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)) with efficient ion sieving and catalytic properties. The resultant multifunctional separators provide robust ion sieving capabilities that promote rapid Li+ transport and intercept polysulfides shuttling. Therefore, The Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)@PP cell maintains 79.45% of its initial capacity after 400 cycles at a high rate of 3 C, while achieving an impressive areal capacity of 4.55 mA h cm&#8208;2 even with high sulfur content of 80 wt% at 0.5 C. This work provides valuable insights for rational design of MOF interface engineering in high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapidly Generated, Ultra&#8208;Stable, and Switchable Photoinduced Radicals: A Solid&#8208;State Photochromic Paradigm for Reusable Paper Light&#8208;Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although photochromic molecules have attracted widespread interest in various fields, solid&#8208;state photochromism remains a formidable challenge, owing to the substantial conformational constraints that hinder traditional molecular photoisomerization processes. Benefiting from the significant color change upon radical generation, chemical systems enabling a photoinduced radical (PIR) behavior through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be ideal candidates for solid&#8208;state photochromism within minimized need of conformational freedom. However, the transient nature of radicals causes a dilemma in this scheme. Herein, we present a general crystal engineering strategy for rapidly generated (7&#8208;s irradiation to saturation) and ultra&#8208;stable (lasting 12 weeks) PIRs in the solid state, based on the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes to form a strong non&#8208;covalent network for efficient PET and radical stabilization. Using this strategy, a PIR platform was constructed, with a superior photochromic behavior remaining in different solid forms (even in the fully&#8208;ground sample) due to their transcendent crystallization ability. On this basis, our compounds can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing, accompanied by water fumigation for modulating the reversible process. This work provides new insights into addressing solid&#8208;state photochromism and can inspire a wide range of optical material design from the switchable radical perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights Into the Role of &#960;&#8208;Electrons of Aromatic Aldehydes in Passivating Perovskite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic ketones or aldehydes have been demonstrated to be effective defect passivators for perovskite films to improve performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It has been claimed that both &#960;&#8208;electrons within aromatic units and carbonyl groups can, separately, interact with ionic defects, which, however, causes troubles in understanding the passivation mechanism of those aromatic ketone/aldehyde molecules. Herein, we clarify the effect of both moieties in one molecule on the defect passivation by investigating three aromatic aldehydes with varied conjugation planes, namely, biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carbaldehyde (BPCA), naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (NACA) and pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde (PyCA). Our findings reveal that the &#960;&#8208;electrons located in the conjugated system do not directly present strong passivation for defects, but enhance the electron cloud density of the carbonyl group augmenting its interaction with defect sites; thereby, with the extended conjugation plane of the three molecules, their defect passivation ability is gradually improved. PSCs incorporating PyCA with the most extended &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalization achieve maximum power conversion efficiencies of 25.67% (0.09 cm&#178;) and 21.76% (14.0 cm&#178;). Moreover, these devices exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95% of their initial efficiency after operation for 1000 hours at the maximum power point.</dc:description>

         <title>A FRET&#160;Autophagy Imaging Platform by Macrocyclic Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagy is a ubiquitous process of organelle interaction in eukaryotic cells, in which various organelles or proteins are recycled and operated through the autophagy pathway to ensure nutrient and energy homeostasis. Although numerous fluorescent probes have been developed to image autophagy, these environment&#8208;responsive probes suffer from inherent deficiencies such as inaccuracy and limited versatility.  Here, we present a modular macrocyclic amphiphile F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform (SC6A12C/NCM, SN), constructed through the amphiphilic assembly of sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SC6A12C) with N&#8208;cetylmorpholine (NCM) for lysosome targeting. The hydrophobic fluorophore BPEA (FRET donor) was entrapped within the inner hydrophobic phase and showed strong fluorescence emission. Attributed to the broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of SC6A12C, three commercially available organelle probes (Mito&#8208;Tracker Red, ER Tracker Red, and RhoNox&#8208;1) were selected as SC6A12C guests (FRET acceptors). During autophagy process, the formation of intracellular host&#8208;guest complexes leads to strong FRET signal, allowing us to visualize the fusion of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus with lysosomes, respectively. This study provides a versatile and accessible platform for imaging organelle autophagy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Alkaline Water Splitting by Porous Macrocyclic Proton Sponges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles are unique as they encapsulate and transfer guest molecules or ions and facilitate catalytic processes. Although metalated macrocycles are pivotal in electrocatalytic processes, using metal&#8208;free analogs has been rare. Following the strategy of Kanbara et al., we synthesized an azacalixarene macrocycle&#8212; N, N&#8217;, N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tris(p&#8208;aminophenyl)azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine (CalixNH2). The macrocycle encapsulates a proton in its cavity, maintaining the protonation even in highly alkaline media. Notably, it retains almost 50% protonated form in 1 M KOH (~pH 14)&#8212;acting as a proton sponge. As hydrogen evolution is complex in alkaline media owing to sluggish water dissociation, we implemented the proton sponge (CalixNH2) in an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Conjugated Porous polymers, TpCalix and DhaCalix, have been synthesized from the triamine&#8212;CalixNH2. The most efficient catalyst, TpCalix, has shown excellent performance in alkaline HER and OER in 1 M KOH (~pH 14), with low overpotentials of only 112(&#177;2) and 290(&#177;2) mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and durable up to 24 hours. A full&#8208;cell reaction using TpCalix in both the cathode and anode exhibited a low full&#8208;cell voltage of 1.73 V and was stable for 12 hours. DFT calculations verified the tripyridinic core, which acts as the principal site for proton abstraction and binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Featuring Reversible Redox Transformation of Polyoxomolybdate Moiet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#183;3CyPh2PO&#183;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72 T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04 T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2 K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent catalysis represents an exciting frontier for unlocking molecular structural diversity and exploring new activation modes. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of polarity&#8208;reversed divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes, where enolizable aliphatic aldehydes are selectively activated by nickel hydride to form two distinct alkylnickel intermediates divergently. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) hold significant potential in organic spintronics and organic magnets. However, their synthesis is very challenging due to their extremely high reactivity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a kinetically blocked derivative (1) of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3',2'&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, which represents a rare persistent triplet diradical of a Kekul&#233; PH. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements. Its structure was also unequivocally confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The key design principle is to extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation for achieving the decrease of the bonding interaction and the increase of the exchange interaction between unpaired electrons, which are essential for accessing the stable triplet ground state. Due to kinetic blocking, 1 shows a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of 64 h under ambient conditions. It has a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. Notably, its dication and dianion exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state and near&#8208;infrared absorption, and the structures were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. This study will shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel stable PHs with high&#8208;spin multiplicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Cascade Nanosystems for Spatiotemporally Controlled Gene&#8208;Silencing and Gas Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the tremendous potential of DNAzymes in gene therapy, achieving gene regulation with spatiotemporal precision and satisfactory efficacy remains a key challenge. Herein, we developed a near&#8208;infrared light (NIR)&#8208;triggered cascade effect system that enables precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This nanoplatform was constructed using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme, a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The UCNPs act as light converters, facilitating the precursor to produce NO under NIR light irradiation, while the generated NO not only participates directly in gas therapy but also induces the upregulation of cytoplasmic APE1 level, resulting in enhanced DNAzyme activation and spatially controlled gene silencing. By leveraging this mechanism, cascade effects mediated gas&#8208;gene synergistic therapy is achieved through the combination of NIR light&#8208;controlled NO release and APE1&#8208;activatable gene therapy. We demonstrated that this nanoplatform enables enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy represents a critical step forward in the quest for highly targeted and efficient cancer treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Enables RNA Aptamers to Function as Sensors for Reactive Inorganic Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising (bio)sensing platforms that are genetically encodable. However, FLAP&#8208;mediated detection of each distinct target necessitates either in vitro selection or nucleic acid sequence engineering. Furthermore, an aptamer that binds an inorganic target or a chemical species with a short lifetime is challenging to realize. Here, we describe a small&#8208;molecule approach that makes it possible for a single FLAP system to detect chemically unique, non&#8208;fluorogenic, and reactive inorganics. We developed functionalized pre&#8208;ligands of RNA aptamers that bind benzylidene imidazolinones (Baby Spinach, Broccolli, Squash). Reactive inorganics, hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS&#8211;) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can specifically convert these pre&#8208;ligands into native ligands that fluoresce with FLAPs. Adaptation of this platform to live cells opened an opportunity for constructing whole&#8208;cell sensors: Escherichia coli transformed with a Baby Spinach&#8208;encoding plasmid and incubated with pre&#8208;ligands generated fluorescence in response to exogenous H2S/HS&#8211; or H2O2. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules eliminates the requirement of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence or oligonucleotide scaffold engineering for distinct molecular targets. Our method allows for detecting inorganic, short&#8208;lived species, thereby advancing FLAP systems beyond their current capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Dimerization: Harnessing Tetrameric Coiled&#8208;Coils for Nanostructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Versatile DNA and polypeptide&#8208;based structures have been designed based on complementary modules. However, polypeptides can also form higher oligomeric states. We investigated the introduction of tetrameric modules as a substitute for coiled&#8208;coil dimerization units used in previous modular nanostructures. Tetramerizing helical bundles can run in parallel or antiparallel orientation, expanding the number of topological solutions for modular nanostructures. Furthermore, this strategy facilitates the construction of nanostructures from two identical polypeptide chains. Importantly, tetrameric modules substantially stabilized protein nanostructures against air&#8208;water interface denaturation, enabling the determination of the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy three&#8208;dimensional structure of a coiled&#8208;coil&#8208;based nanostructure, confirming the designed agreement of the modules forming a tetrahedral cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalytic Nucleation and Self&#8208;Assembly of&#160; Inorganic Nanoparticles into Complex Biosimilar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;replication of&#160; molecules and microdroplets have been explored as models in prebiotic chemistry. An analogous process for inorganic nanomaterials would involve the autocatalytic nucleation of&#160; nanoparticles&#8212;an area that remains largely uncharted. Demonstrating such systems would be both fundamentally intriguing and practically relevant, especially if the resulting particles self&#8208;assemble. Here, we show that autocatalytic nucleation couples with self&#8208;assembly occurs with silver nanoparticles. In dispersions containing &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles, these reactions produce complex colloids with hierarchical spike organization. On solid surfaces, autocatalytic nucleation of nanoparticles yields conformal networks with hierarchical organization, including nanoparticle &#8220;colonies.&#8221; We analyzed the complexity of both types of solid&#8208;stabilized particle assemblies via graph theory (GT).&#160; The complexity index of idealized spiky colloids is comparable to that of complex algal skeletons. The GT analysis of the percolating nanoparticle networks revealed their similarities to the bacterial, but not fungal, biofilms. We conclude that coupling autocatalytic nucleation with self&#8208;assembly enables the generation of complex, biosimilar particles and films. This work establishes mathematical and structural parallels between biotic and abiotic matter, integrating self&#8208;organization, autocatalytic nucleation, and theoretical description of complex system.&#160; Utilization of quantitative descriptors of connectivity patterns opens possibility to GT&#8208;based biomimetic engineering of conductive coatings and other complex nanostructures.</dc:description>

Abstract
Increasing the diversity of bio&#8208;based polymers is needed to address the combined problems of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the problems necessitates rapid discovery of new materials; however, identification of appropriate chemistries maybe slow using current iterative methods. Machine learning (ML) methods could significantly expedite new material discovery and property identification. Here, PolyAGM, a ML algorithm using graph kernel methods, is introduced and used to predict the properties of block copolymers and identify the responsible structural &#8216;motifs&#8217;. It applies a &#8220;fingerprinting&#8221; method to convert Graph representations of polymers into numerical vectors. The Graphs explicitly encode the entire copolymer of atoms and bonds such that the sequencing of chemical features and polymer chain length are included, alongside relevant stereochemical information. PolyAGM gives predictions for both thermal and mechanical properties that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. This work focuses on predicting the properties of bio&#8208;derived ABA&#8208;block polymer thermoplastic elastomers, but the general fingerprinting technique of PolyAGM should be relevant to other application fields.

         <title>IrPdCuFeNiCoMo Based Core&#8208;Shell Icosahedron Nanocrystals and Nanocages for Efficient and Robust Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured icosahedron nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy shell were deliberately designed and synthesized and sequential chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy nanocages, which show robust performance towards acidic oxygen evolution reaction, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable over 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Facets engineering of high entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals might be achieved via shape&#8208;controlled synthesis, which is promising but remains challenging in designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts towards efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Herein, icosahedra nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo shell were prepared by wet&#8208;chemical reduction in one&#8208;pot, ascribing to the initial formation PdCu core and subsequent deposition and diffusion of IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA shell. Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 51.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and 1624&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.50&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77&#8197;V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains stable over 900&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations attribute the enhanced intrinsic activity to the broad distribution of the binding energy for OER intermediates on IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA, which breaks the linear scaling relationship and accelerates the OER process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facets engineering of high entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals might be achieved via shape-controlled synthesis, which is promising but remains challenging in designing Ir-based catalysts towards efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Herein, icosahedra nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo shell were prepared by wet-chemical reduction in one-pot, ascribing to the initial formation PdCu core and subsequent deposition and diffusion of IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA shell. Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 51.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1624&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.50&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77&#8197;V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and maintains stable over 900&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Unlocking the Ultrafast Deposition Kinetics within Bi&#8208;Tailored Core&#8208;Shell Structured Carbon Nanofibers for Highly Efficient and Ultrastable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in the void spaces (Bi@NC) serves as a core&#8211;shell structured Na metal host. The in&#8208;situ formed Na3Bi facilitates rapid nucleation and ion diffusion, enabling uniform Na plating within the cavities and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. This design ensures high&#8208;rate performance and cycle stability, thereby providing a testament to its suitability in Na metal anode chemistry.







Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMA), featuring high energy content, low electrochemical potential and easy availability, are a compelling option for sustainable energy storage. However, notorious sodium dendrite and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) have largely retarded their widespread implantation. Herein, porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in nanopores (Bi@NC) was rationally designed as a 3D host for SMA. In situ and ex situ characterizations, along with theoretical simulations unlock that the in&#8208;situ formed Na&#8722;Bi alloy significantly accelerates sodium metal nucleation and sodium ion diffusion kinetics, enabling uniform sodium plating within the void spaces and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. Particularly, the Bi@NC electrode achieved a high coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in half&#8208;cell tests, a cycle life of 1000&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and sustained performance over 600 cycles under harsh conditions under 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 within symmetrical cells. The full battery assembled with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode and Bi@NC anode delivered long&#8208;term cyclability over 800 cycles, demonstrating its potential for flexible application of sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems. This work highlights the Bi@NC electrode as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance and flexible sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amplified cascade catalysis consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) deoxygenation and Fenton reaction is reported and applied to reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two catalysts used in this amplified cascade catalysis can interact with each other, enabling regeneration of ferrocene catalyst and thus enhancing hydroxyl radical production and polymerization rate. The concept of amplified cascade catalysis and the way how a biocatalyst recycles a chemical catalyst to enhance catalysis efficiency may inspire development of sustainable and ecofriendly catalytic methodologies for organic and material synthesis.







Abstract
We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.

         <title>A Generally Applicable Method for Disentangling the Effect of Individual Noncovalent Interactions on the Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) Scheme is introduced for precise quantification of individual interactions within complex molecular systems. Applications across diverse fields, encompassing protein&#8208;ligand binding energies and association energies in large biomolecular assemblies, showcase the versatility and broad applicability of this approach.







Abstract
We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research is the first example to introduce systematic substituents and large conjugated aromatic structure (13 benzene rings) into a long&#8208;range ordered framework simultaneously and achieved directionally modification of nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8722;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.

         <title>mPatch: A Wearable Hydrogel Microneedle Patch for In Vivo Optical Sensing of Calcium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intradermal sensing platform featuring a handheld complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) sensor to detect fluorescence from aptamer&#8208;containing, transparent hydrogel embedded in the dermis. Aptamers conjugated to the hydrogel change fluorescence dynamically in response to the concentration of calcium ions in the interstitial fluid.







Abstract
This study presents an in vivo optical hydrogel microneedle platform that measures levels of analytes in interstitial fluid. The platform builds on a previously published technique for molding hydrogel microneedles by developing a composite hydrogel (i.e., PEGDA and polyacrylamide) that is sufficiently stiff to penetrate skin in the hydrated state and whose fluorescence changes dynamically&#8211;via a conjugated aptamer&#8211;depending on level of analyte. In a demonstration relevant to hypercalcemia, the hydrogel microneedle distinguished varying concentrations of calcium (within a range of 0 to 2&#8197;mM, which spans physiologically meaningful variations for hypoparathyroidism) within 10&#8197;minutes. In rats, a compact CMOS sensor measuring fluorescence from microneedles distinguished low hypercalcemic (1.7&#8197;mM) from high hypercalcemic (2.3&#8197;mM) ionized calcium levels as determined from reference blood measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates in vivo feasibility of a concept&#8211;which we call mPatch&#8211;for an optical hydrogel microneedle to measure small changes in levels of analytes in interstitial fluid, which does not rely on extraction of interstitial fluid out of the dermis.

         <title>Bridged Carbolong Modulating Interfacial Charge Transfer Enhancement for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Bridged Carbolong Modulating for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A bridged carbolong modulating strategy to regulate the perovskite/C60 to accelerate interfacial electron transfer, reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration. The photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stable devices reached 25.80% of efficiency and maintained 98% of its initial efficiency over 1400 h of illumination, and the efficiency of modules achieved 20.72% (25.25 cm2 active area) with robust operational stability.







Abstract
Efficient regulation of perovskite/C60 interface is crucial to improving the long&#8208;term stability of the inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, precise methods for controlling the perovskite/C60 interface have yet to be thoroughly explored. Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C60 due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron&#8208;transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19&#8201;V and 84.53&#8201;%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98&#8201;% of their original efficiency after 1400&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2500&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong&#8208;modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72&#8201;% (active area of 25.25 cm2) with robust operation stability.

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;solid reaction system with high selectivity, controllability and compatibility enables fast etching, doping and transformation of MAX phases and the large&#8208;scale production of MXenes and their derivatives. The as&#8208;obtained samples exhibit excellent capability in effectively reducing the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides via chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion as evidenced by both of theoretical and experimental results.







Abstract
The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
An adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis is established for the enantioselective S&#8208;arylation of sulfenamides, precisely accessing various multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines with excellent efficiencies and selectivity (67 examples, 12 possible isomers, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The S&#8208;arylation/pyramidal inversion sequence enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines.







Abstract
An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.

         <title>Dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 Sites in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Efficient Cascade Catalysis for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia (eNO3RR) offers a promising solution to both environmental pollution and the sustainable energy conversion. Here we propose an efficient cascade catalytic mechanism based on a dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 sites, orderly assembled in a redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework structure, which separately promotes the reaction kinetics of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;nitrite and nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversions. Specifically, the Zn5 clusters adsorb and selectively reduce the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas [NiS4] acts as an analogue to the ferredoxins, subsequently boosts the reduction of NO2&#8722; to produce NH3. To this end, the bimetallic Zn5&#8208;NiS4TP MOF was synthesized based on the redox&#8208;active ligand [Ni(C2S2(TPCOOH)2)2]. A maximum ammonia production rate of 23650.63 &#181;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mg&#8722;1site and faradaic efficiency 92.57% was achived by Zn5&#8208;NiS4TP MOF under neutral conditions. To validate the critical role of dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 sites, Mn5&#8208;NiS4TP and Cd2&#8208;NiS4TP were synthesized as control samples, together with Zn&#8208;TTFTB, Zn&#8208;NiS4Ph and other Zn5&#8208;cluster&#8208;based MOFs applied for the investigation of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Our results indicated that substitution by &#8208;thienyl instead of &#8208;phenyl group increases the S&#8208;heteroatom content, improves the conductivity and facilitates electron transfer.

Here we propose an efficient cascade catalytic mechanism based on a dual Zn5-NiS4 sites, orderly assembled in a redox-active metal-organic framework structure, which separately promotes the reaction kinetics of nitrate-to-nitrite and nitrite-to-ammonia conversions. Specifically, the Zn5 clusters adsorb and selectively reduce the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas [NiS4] acts as an analogue to the ferredoxins, subsequently boosts the reduction of NO2&#8722; to produce NH3. To this end, the bimetallic Zn5-NiS4TP MOF was synthesized based on the redox-active ligand [Ni(C2S2(TPCOOH)2)2]. A maximum ammonia production rate of 23650.63 &#181;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mg&#8722;1site and faradaic efficiency 92.57% was achived by Zn5-NiS4TP MOF under neutral conditions. To validate the critical role of dual Zn5-NiS4 sites, Mn5-NiS4TP and Cd2-NiS4TP were synthesized as control samples, together with Zn-TTFTB, Zn-NiS4Ph and other Zn5-cluster-based MOFs applied for the investigation of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Our results indicated that substitution by -thienyl instead of -phenyl group increases the S-heteroatom content, improves the conductivity and facilitates electron transfer. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the energy changes for the reduction of each species could rationalize experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule's methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.13%, along with outstanding photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Fused vs 575&#8208;Ringed Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Selective Synthesis, Reactivity and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Bilayer Transport through a Photoswitchable Membrane&#8208;Stiffening Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mobility of proteins in the bilayer membrane is affected by (local) changes in lipid environment, which is important to their biological functioning. Artificial molecular systems that &#8211; to some extent &#8211; imitate tasks of membrane&#8208;embedded proteins are increasingly developed, however, they are usually controlled through responsive units in their core structure. Here we present an alternative approach based on an amphiphilic stiff&#8208;stilbene derivative that enables control of membrane fluidity by light. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters as a result of a higher mobility. The photoisomerization process is studied by UV&#8208;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution and in POPC vesicles, where the light&#8208;induced changes in fluidity and hence, activity of anion transporters, are monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Dynamic light&#8208;scattering (DLS) and cryo&#8208;EM studies show that vesicle integrity is not impaired by photoswitching. Our work introduces a versatile approach to control solute transport by carrier molecules. Moreover, the photocontrol over membrane fluidity and, with that, mobility could eventually be used for directed motion, which we expect to be key in achieving active transport in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Aromatic Linkers in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on the Performance of Monolithic Perovskite/Si Tandem Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic linker&#8208;constructed self&#8208;assembled monolayers (Ar&#8208;SAMs)&#160; can modulate the&#160;work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), thereby improving hole extraction/transport&#160;efficiency. However, the specific role of the aromatic linkers between the polycyclic&#160;head and the anchoring groups of SAMs in determining the performance of perovskite&#160;solar cells (PSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we developed a series of&#160;phenothiazine&#8208;based Ar&#8208;SAMs to investigate how different aromatic linkers could affect&#160;molecular stacking, the regulation of substrate work function, and charge carrier&#160;dynamics. When served as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in PSCs and monolithic
perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs), we found that the Ar&#8208;SAM with&#160;naphthalene linker along the 2,6&#8208;position axis (&#946;&#8208;Nap) could form dense and highly&#160;ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level&#160;alignment with the perovskite films. Using this strategy, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap
PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86% with&#160;negligible hysteresis, utilizing a 1.68 eV perovskite. Additionally, the encapsulated&#160;devices demonstrated enhanced stability under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2, 50%&#160;RH, 65&#176;C) with a T91 of 1000 hours. Notably, the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs, based on&#160;solution&#8208;processed micron&#8208;scale textured silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells,&#160;achieved an efficiency of 28.89% with outstanding reproducibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion by Limiting Interfacial Hydroxyl Radicals Using Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8211;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C1 products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8211;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO4 photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO4@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#183;OH to activate CH4 into &#183;CH3, but also in&#8208;situ consumes those &#183;OH species to retard their further attack on &#183;CH3, resulting in an enhanced &#183;CH3/&#183;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8211;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#183;CH3/&#183;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH4 via a gas&#8208;diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO4@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, a high selectivity of 86%, and a stable photoconversion of &gt; 100 h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in&#8208;situ generation and modulation of the &#183;OH levels for photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward multi&#8208;carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid&#8208;based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Halting Oxygen Evolution to Achieve Long Cycle Life in Sodium Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high&#8208;energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi&#8208;concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P&#8208;O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, we reveal that a high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering has capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental P3' phases. As a consequence, the high&#8208;voltage cycling stability has been greatly enhanced, up to 4.4 V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles and 76.1% capacity retention at 2C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling, safe batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote On&#8208;Paper Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Based High&#8208;Safety and Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating needs in information protection underscore the urgency of developing advanced encryption strategies. Herein we report a novel chemical approach that enables information encryption by on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Dendritic porous silica nanospheres modified with polyetherimide and bovine serum albumin were prepared as the chemical ink to write the secret message on a paper. Attaching the paper to an electrode, immersing it in a solution containing tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and then applying a suitable voltage, a remote &#8220;catalytic route&#8221; electrochemical reaction produces ECL that functions as the key to decrypt and visualize the message by imaging. In addition, proteins can be also used as the biological ink to write the secret message, which is then decrypted by a combined use of immunochemistry and ECL imaging as two keys. We believe the ECL&#8208;based strategy holds great promise in high&#8208;safety and multilevel information encryption, as it is protected not only by encoding, like conventional invisible inks, but also by the unique ECL decoding approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Radical Mediated Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Conjugate&#8208;Enhanced Phenolic Resins with Ultrafast Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is essential for the development of highly efficient polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Nevertheless, the non&#8208;uniform molecular structures and sluggish reaction pathway of polymeric photocatalysts lead to low conversion efficiency. In this work, we report sulfur&#8208;contained phenolic resins with regulated conjugation for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the substitution of sulfur for methylene in the phenolic resin structure, the conjugation degree of the material is adjusted, resulting in the formation of a built&#8208;in electric field. This effectively enhances the charge separation capability, enabling charge carriers to react faster with substrates. Through in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we have unveiled that the introduction of sulfur can modulate the reaction pathway of phenolic resin materials, enabling a dual&#8208;pathway photocatalytic H2O2 production mediated by non&#8208;radical species. Impressively, the sulfur&#8208;contained resin photocatalyst showcases exceptional H2O2 production activity with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4% exceeding most reported systems, and generates 25 mmol m&#8208;2 of H2O2 under natural sunlight through large&#8208;scale equipment. This work provides a facile strategy to separate the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs of polymer photocatalysts to achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switching Based on Fe(II)&#8208;Hg(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8208; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2 &#8776; 102 K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10 K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310 nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310 nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40 K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8208;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalisation: Sulfoximines as N&#8208; and O&#8208;Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the nucleophilic oxidants employed in the gold&#8208;catalysed oxidation of alkynes, sulphur&#8208;based reagents have played a substantial role since the beginning, granting access to the respective gold carbene intermediates. Herein, we describe the first example of the substance class of sulfoximines being used as atom transfer reagents to alkynes in gold catalysis. Based on the transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, it is demonstrated that the sulfoximine functionality is capable of selectively transferring first its nitrogen moiety to the alkyne, forming the &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene, which is then oxidised by the released sulfoxide moiety in a second step via a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular mechanism &#8211; a distinctive feature that differentiates this work mechanistically from earlier studies. A combination of extensive experimental and theoretical studies provides evidence for this mechanistic rationale. As no external reagents for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalisation of the alkyne unit are required, a wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the transformation, affording the desired 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones in mostly good yields. It was further also showcased that it is possible to combine our methodology with additional transformations of the 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;one core in one&#8208;pot procedures, allowing facile access to C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Control of TRPM8 Channels with Photoswitchable Menthol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels are well known as sensors for cold temperatures and cooling agents such as menthol and icilin and these channels are tightly regulated by the membrane lipid phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2). Since TRPM8 channels emerged as promising drug targets for treating pain, itching, obesity, cancer, dry eye disease, and inflammation, we aimed at developing a high&#8208;precision TRPM8 channel activator, to achieve spatiotemporal control of TRPM8 activity with light. In this study, we designed, synthesized and characterized the first photoswitchable TRPM8 activator azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM). AzoM enables optical control of endogenously and heterologously expressed TRPM8 channels with UV and blue light which is demonstrated by performing patch&#8208;clamp experiments. Moreover, AzoM facilitates the reliable determination of activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics thereby providing further insights into the channel gating. Using AzoM, the specific roles of individual amino acids for AzoM or PIP2 binding and for sensitization by PIP2 can be elucidated. Altogether, AzoM represents as a high&#8208;precision pharmaceutical tool for reversible control of TRPM8 channel function that enhances our biophysical understanding of TRPM8 channels and holds the potential to support the development of novel pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight&#8208;chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the (002) crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8208;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF&#8208;8 matrix for PEO&#8208;based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8315;&#179; S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO&#8322;, LiNi&#8320;.&#8329;Co&#8320;.&#8320;&#8325;Mn&#8320;.&#8320;&#8325;O&#8322;, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10 C with LiFePO&#8324; cathodes and stable operation at &#8208;30 &#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering d&#8208;p orbital hybridization by incorporating single&#8208;atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion&#8208;conductive CPEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sabatier Optimal of Mn&#8208;N4 Single Atom Catalysts for Selective Oxidative Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Sabatier relationship was realized by a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst with metal single atoms for regulating adsorption energies of two reactants in selective oxidative desulfurization. This relationship revealed reactivity descriptors of H2S&#8208;ODH for high performance in a wide range of O2 concentrations.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship of competitive adsorption between reactants is the prerequisite for high activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis, especially the difference between the adsorption energies (Eads) of two reactive intermediates in Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models. Using oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S&#8208;ODH) as a probe, we develop various metal single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;NDC) catalysts for controlling Eads&#8208;H2S, Eads&#8208;O2 and investigating the difference in activity and selectivity. Combining theoretical and experimental results, a Sabatier relationship between the catalytic performance and Eads&#8208;O2/Eads&#8208;H2S emerges. Mn&#8208;NDC as the optimal catalyst shows excellent H2S conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%) and sulfur selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a wide range of O2 concentrations over 100&#8197;h. Such a high&#8208;efficiency performance is attributed to appropriate Eads&#8208;H2S and Eads&#8208;O2 on Mn&#8208;N4 sites, boosting redox cycle between Mn2+ and Mn3+, as well as preferential formation of sulfur. This work provides a fundamental guidance for designing Sabatier optimal catalysts in L&#8722;H models.

         <title>Expedited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitor Discovery through Modular &#8216;Direct&#8208;to&#8208;Biology&#8217; Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology workflows promise to accelerate hit optimisation for drug discovery. Here, we describe a direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology method for the efficient synthesis and screening of cysteine&#8208;reactive fragments and its application in the optimisation of a micromolar inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease towards nanomolar covalent analogues. Additionally, we describe an under&#8208;reported switch from the covalent series to a potent, non&#8208;covalent series.







Abstract
Reactive fragment (RF) screening has emerged as an efficient method for ligand discovery across the proteome, irrespective of a target's perceived tractability. To date, however, the efficiency of subsequent optimisation campaigns has largely been low&#8208;throughput, constrained by the need for synthesis and purification of target compounds. We report an efficient platform for &#8216;direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8217; (D2B) screening of cysteine&#8208;targeting chloroacetamide RFs, wherein synthesis is performed in 384&#8208;well plates allowing direct assessment in downstream biological assays without purification. Here, the developed platform was used to optimise inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (MPro), an established drug target for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19. An initial RF hit was developed into a series of potent inhibitors, and further exploration using D2B screening enabled a &#8216;switch&#8217; to a reversible inhibitor series. This example of ligand discovery for MPro illustrates the acceleration that D2B chemistry can offer for optimising RFs towards covalent inhibitor candidates, as well as providing future impetus to explore the evolution of RFs into non&#8208;covalent ligands.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalysts: From Model to Reality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively utilized in catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. This review summarizes the progress of 2D materials from model studies to application in catalysis and illustrates how 2D materials serve as models to explore structure&#8211;activity relationships by combining theoretical calculations and surface research.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well&#8208;defined structures. With easily identified structure&#8208;modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure&#8208;function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalysts. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal, and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure&#8208;activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface research. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed. This review provides a reference for the design of catalyst structure and composition, and could inspire the realization of two&#8208;dimensional materials from model study to reality application in industry.

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Mediated Efficient Non&#8208;Radiative Transition for R848&#8208;Assisted Photothermal Immunotherapy to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis by An In Situ Tumor Vaccine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition was observed in two isomers, namely CZTBT and LVTBT. Upon combination with R848, LVTBT@R848 NPs&#8208;induced photothermal immunotherapy could serve as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, effectively inhibiting the growth of both primary and distant tumors, as well as restricted lung metastasis by activating the overwhelming immune response.







Abstract
Cancer metastasis remains a critical factor contributing to the current limitations in cancer treatment. Photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and potent therapeutic approach, demonstrating the capability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. While researchers have extensively investigated various structural modifications to enhance photothermal conversion performance, the influence of molecular configuration has received comparatively limited attention. In this study, we synthesized two isomers, CZTBT and LVTBT, which possessed distinct configurations. LVTBT, characterized by a flatter molecular configuration, exhibited an extended absorption wavelength and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non&#8208;radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3&#8201;%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) analogue with a strictly alternating arrangement of BN units along the chain was prepared by an AB&#8208;polymerization process. The polymer and monodisperse oligomers show emission from locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, respectively, which can be addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.







Abstract
Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B terminus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone structure, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evidence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be optionally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Layered Hybrid Double Perovskites Driven by a Dual&#8208;Ion&#8208;Woven Supramolecular Framework for X&#8208;Ray Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RP&#8208;like DJ&#8208;phase layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) constructed by an unprecedented dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework are developed to boost interlayer charge transport, achieving a record&#8208;high sensitivity of 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among all the reported LHDP materials. A large&#8208;area [00l]&#8208;oriented composite membrane is prepared to obtain a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography, showcasing superior next&#8208;generation radiographic potential.







Abstract
A promising candidate for X&#8208;ray detection is layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) with excellent structural stability, but their sensitivity is generally limited by unsatisfactory interlayer charge transport. Herein, employing one ethylenediamine (EDA) chain as a structural inducer, we successfully obtain unusual Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) phase LHDPs, (EDABr)4AgBiBr8 and (EDABr)4CuBiBr8, featuring a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;like (RP&#8208;like) interlayer. Thanks to the bridging of bromine anions, organic cations are linked via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds, where two ionic spacers are orderly woven into a supramolecular framework. Consequently, the RP&#8208;like interlayer space is regulated by the dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework with embedded charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond networks, remarkably enriching interlayer interactions and boosting charge transport. Through theoretical calculations, structural roles of the supramolecular framework are elucidated by extra orbital contribution and large diffusion barrier of Br anions. As proof of concept, the sensitivity of RP&#8208;like devices up to 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is a record&#8208;high of LHDP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors for now, while a low detection limit (91&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1) and outstanding radiation&#8208;resistant capability (50&#8197;Gyair) are achieved. Moreover, an oriented membrane device is prepared to demonstrate high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography. These findings offer a brand&#8208;new interlayer&#8208;modulation strategy for the construction of sensitive and stable scintillation semiconductors.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of the isolated indole molecule as well as indole dissolved in water were sampled with and without consideration of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). For each sampled structure, electronic excitation energies were calculated using a wavefunction&#8208;based method called ADC(2) for generating UV/Vis absorption spectra. Shapes and solvatochromism observed in the measured spectra were reproduced only when NQEs were considered in the sampling.

Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies and enhanced path integral simulations for rigorous sampling of nuclear configurations including the quantum effects in solution. After validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered, without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening, only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are &#8220;visible&#8221; in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.

     alt="Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structures of the isolated indole molecule as well as indole dissolved in water were sampled with and without consideration of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). For each sampled structure, electronic excitation energies were calculated using a wavefunction-based method called ADC(2) for generating UV/Vis absorption spectra. Shapes and solvatochromism observed in the measured spectra were reproduced only when NQEs were considered in the sampling.

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanofluidic neuromorphic device based on metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) was presented, which can be controllably modulated by the light stimulation for emulating biological synaptic behaviors. This work opens up an avenue toward advanced applications using nanofluidic iontronic systems, such as brain&#8208;mimicking computing and brain&#8208;computer interfaces.







Abstract
Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.

         <title>Mutual Dependence between Membrane Phase Separation and Bacterial Division Protein Dynamics in Synthetic Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the mutual dependence of membrane phase separation and bacterial division protein dynamics. By reconstituting Min and Fts proteins inside phase separated GUVs, we observe interesting mode selection for protein dynamics and change in the reaction kinetics. We detect membrane deformations in the form of GUV blebs in synthetic cell models.







Abstract
Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid&#8208;cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane&#8208;lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane&#8208;bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle&#8208;based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro&#8208;scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase&#8208;separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase&#8208;separated GUVs leads to blebbing&#8208;like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.

         <title>Improving the Blue Color Purity of Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes with the Assistance of F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interaction towards High&#8208;Performance Blue Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQE over 33&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
Incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups enhances color purity and luminous efficiency in tetradentate Pt(II) complexes through F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction, resulting in blue OLEDs with EQEmax over 33&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.14).







Abstract
Among the various challenges in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), simultaneously achieving high efficiency, a long lifespan, and a narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) in blue OLEDs remains a significant hurdle. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to improve the color purity of tetradentate Pt(II) complexes with the assistance of &#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction by incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups into the well&#8208;known blue tetradentate Pt(II) phosphorescent complex. The results show that the different substitution positions of &#8722;CF3 have significantly varying effects on the FWHM values of the complexes; specifically, introducing &#8722;CF3 on the benzene ring of carbazole effectively reduces the FWHM, while introducing it on the benzene ring linked to the carbene unit has a minimal impact. When utilized in a mixed host system of SiCzCz/SiTrzCz2, the OLEDs with these new complexes as emitters demonstrated maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 27.1&#8201;%, 33.8&#8201;%, and 27.6&#8201;% for PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;1, PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2, and PtON&#8208;2CF3, respectively, with excellent color purity (CIEy&#8776;0.14 for the PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 based device). Notably, the device based on PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 matched the stability of the benchmark PtON&#8208;TBBI complex.This work offers an important guideline for the design of high efficient Pt(II) phosphorescent complexes with good blue color purity.

         <title>Reactive Intermediate Confinement in Beta Zeolites for the Efficient Aerobic Epoxidation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient conversion of long&#8208;chain linear &#945;&#8208;olefins (LAOs) into industrially useful epoxides is of pivotal importance. Mukaiyama epoxidation based on the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant and aldehyde as the cosubstrate offers a promising route for LAOs epoxidation. However, challenges associated with epoxide forming selectivity and aldehyde coupling efficiency have long impeded the adoption of Mukaiyama epoxidation in large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, we show that confinement of key intermediates involved in the parallel epoxidation pathways within a Beta zeolite unlocks a selectivity of greater than 95% towards the epoxides at the expense of minimal consumption of only 1.5 equivalents of the aldehyde, achieving an efficiency better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn sites into the Beta zeolite framework further facilitates the adsorption activation process of the aldehyde cosubstrate, thereby increasing the concentration of acylperoxy radicals and accelerating the kinetic process of the epoxidation step. Consequently, this work not only provides an efficient and green epoxidation route over zeolite catalysts with easily available O2 as the oxidant, but also systematically reveals the fundamental understanding of the zeolite confinement effects on steering the reaction pathway, which benefits the further development of valorization of LAOs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis and Applications of Stereogenic &#946;'&#8208;Methyl Enones and &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;Dimethyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have&#160;been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;&#8208;methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily&#8208;available &#946;'&#8208;methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;'&#8208;methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;'&#8208;methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone, and two C2&#8208;symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Distonic Radical Cation Reactivity in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Altering the reactivity model of a molecule can potentially eliminate limitations existing in its current paradigm. When it comes to the activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes (DACs), Lewis acids have been the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Although a variety of polarized 2&#960;&#160;components have been successfully coupled with DACs for [3+2] cycloaddition, unpolarized alkenes prove to be a roadblock due to an inherent polarity mismatch with the Lewis acid&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediate.&#160; Hereby, harnessing the distonic radical cation mode of cleavage by photoredox catalysis overcomes this mismatched reactivity of the zwitterionic intermediate, providing a unique route to highly substituted cyclopentanes and cyclopentenes. Expansion of this strategy to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes enables access to bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHs) through a facile [3&#963;+2&#963;] cycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic insights are also provided using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength&#160;of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional "starfish&#8208;type" composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8208;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient&#160;&#160;Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34 V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300 hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1% capacity after 2100 cycles at 1.0 C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth&#8208;abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo&#8208;induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co&#8208;catalysts onto 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c&#8208;MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;cost and Environmental&#8208;friendly Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $ g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8208;275.2 $ g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221;pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spontaneous emergence of lipid vesicles in the absence of evolved biological machinery represents a major challenge for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. We show that coacervate microdroplets could create a compartmentalized environment that enriches lipid molecules and facilitates their spontaneous assembly into lipid vesicles. These vesicles can escape from the coacervate microdroplets in a continuous process under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, resembling a constant production process akin to a "primitive enzyme" factory assembly line. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the intricate interaction between lipid molecules and coacervate microdroplets, shedding light on the emergence of cellular systems and offering a new perspective on the conditions necessary for the development of life on Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46 mAh g&#8208;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10 C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70% after 500 cycles) at 4.6 V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen/Electron Amphiphilic Bi&#8208;functional Water Molecular Inactivator&#8208;Assisted Interface Stabilization in Highly Reversible Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8208;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8208;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Resultly, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600 hours at 1 mAh cm&#8208;2@1 mA cm&#8208;2 (more than 250 hours at 50 &#8451;). &#160;Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Reaction Network&#8208;driven Polymerization&#8208;induced Transient Coacervation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Reductive Amination and Tandem Amination&#8211;Alkylation of Esters Enabled by a Cationic Iridium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination &#8208; functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001 mol%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15 g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of&#160;two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2',2''&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8208;H&#8230;N and N&#8208;H&#8230;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In&#8208;situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8208;H&#8230;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8208;1; 88.4% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8208;60 &#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2',2''-(2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-triyl) tris (1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazole-4,9-dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O-H&#8230;N and N-H&#8230;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether- and ester-based solvents. In-situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O-H&#8230;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1; 88.4% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1), fast Li+-storage kinetics (211 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1), and surprising low-temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at -60 &#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The PaDa&#8208;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridging Cyclic Bilatriene Analogue Affords Stable &#960;&#8208;Radicaloid Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable neutral metal radicaloid complexes have been synthesized from a modified tetrapyrrolic pigment, bilatriene, with iridium(I) and rhodium(I) cyclooctadiene (COD) synthons. The bilatriene skeleton contains &#945;&#8208;linked conjugated pyrrole units, whereas an N&#8208;confused analogue used in this work possesses &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole moieties at the terminal, demonstrating a unique metal binding capability. Unprecedentedly, the metal&#8208;COD cations are accommodated at the outer nitrogen sites, which induced the formation of open&#8208;shell metal&#8208;radicaloid species. The resulting compounds are highly stable under ambient conditions and demonstrated facile redox conversion to afford the corresponding cation and anion species. Furthermore, the radicaloid complexes showed a distinct second near&#8208;infrared absorption (NIR&#8208;II) capability extending up to 1500 nm along with high photostability. These features emphasized that the complexes can be potential NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsible photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents based on the metal&#8208;radicaloid dye platform.</dc:description>

         <title>A BOIMPY Dye Enables Multi&#8208;Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis: Reaching Super&#8208;Reducing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con&#8208;PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&gt;2 photons), termed multi&#8208;PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one&#8208;electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super&#8208;reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi&#8208;photon process which is enabled by 390 nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron&#8208;rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi&#8208;PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi&#8208;PET enabled Birch&#8208;type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.</dc:description>

         <title>Coaxial Helices in Chiral Supramolecular Aggregates from Highly Hindered Chiral Allenes</title>

         <dc:description>Chiral allenes self&#8208;assembly following a cooperative mechanism into a supramolecular chiral aggregate consisting of two coaxial helices: the internal helix described by the allene stack and the external helix which consist in a quadruple&#8208;helix described by the four allene substituents. More precisely, this supramolecular aggregate possesses six axially chiral elements within its structure &#8212;the allene, the allene stack (internal helix) and the stacks of the four allene substituents (external 4&#8208;helix)&#8212;. Interestingly, slight variations in the magnitude of the tilting degree while keeping its P&#8208; or M&#8208; orientation (internal helix) can vary the orientation of the 4&#8208;axial motifs at the external helix. Thus, while (P)&#8208;1 produces a supramolecular helix with a Q ca. 15&#176; (Pint) and a M1/P2/M1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (P)&#8208;2 produces a supramolecular helix with a Q ca. 23&#176; (Pint) and a P1/P2/P1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (P)&#8208;1 and (P)&#8208;2 supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulating the potential of Zn anode to operate in low pH and harsh environments for highly sustainable Zn batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH = 3&#8208;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2 V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at &#160;pH = 2.2 for over &#160;3,600 h and 400 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 20 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90 V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25 Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first &#960;&#8208;complexes derived from non&#8208;classical diboriranes (three&#8208;membered aromatic B2C rings) and their carbonylative ring expansion to four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered cyclic ligands. The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; R&#8217;=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to an allylic &#960;&#8208;complex, which further reacts under side&#8208;on addition of CO to the B&#8722;B moiety to an &#951;5&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring. For R&#8217;=SnMe3, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond.







Abstract
Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R=H, SnMe3; Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion under formation of a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non-classical H&#252;ckel-aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#960;-system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non-classical diboriranes cyclo-&#956;-RB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Dur&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh (R=H, SnMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; Dur=2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C ring to either four- or five-membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3-center-2-electron bond (3c2e): The H-bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; to the allylic &#960;-complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; results in the side-on ring expansion under formation of a five-membered B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl-bridged diborirane (R=SnMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) under the same conditions, CO is added end-on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn 3c2e-bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt; clusters, respectively, according to the Wade-Mingos rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8208;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymeric materials featuring wide&#8208;ranging structural control and modularity. The synthesis of a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor Wurster building blocks enabled the formation of isostructural, photoactive COFs with distinct optical features in thin films. These COFs were further applied for photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100&#8197;nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of Wurster D&#8208;A&#8208;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of chemical functionality&#8208;reactivity&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.

         <title>From Ions to Crystals: A Comprehensive View of the Non&#8208;Classical Nucleation of Calcium Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate is a mineral of considerable relevance for various industrial and geochemical processes. In the present work, the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) crystals from aqueous solutions has been elucidated in detail through application of a complementary suite of advanced characterization techniques. The results show how crystalline order emerges from intrinsically disordered precursors and highlights the complexity of mineral nucleation.







Abstract
The early stages of mineralization continue to be in the focus of intensive research due to their inherent importance for natural and engineered environments. While numerous observations have been reported for single steps in the pathways of various crystallizing phases in previous studies, the complexity of the underlying processes and their elusive character have left central questions unanswered in most cases. In the present work, we provide a detailed view on the nucleation of calcium sulfate mineralization&#8212;an abundant mineral with broad use in construction industry&#8212;in aqueous systems at ambient conditions. As experimental basis, a co&#8208;titration procedure with potentiometric, turbidimetric and conductometric detection was developed, allowing solution speciation and the formation of crystallization precursors to be monitored quantitatively as the level of nominal (super)saturation gradually increases. The nature and spatiotemporal evolution of these precursors was further elucidated by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) as a direct imaging technique. The results reveal how ions associate into nanometric primary species, which subsequently aggregate and develop anisotropic order by intrinsic structural reorganization. Our observations challenge the common understanding of fundamental notions such as the nucleation barrier or the meaning of supersaturation, with broad implications for mineralization phenomena in general and the formation of calcium sulfate in geochemical settings and industrial applications in particular.

         <title>Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing dynamic boroxine linkers into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333 creates defects that expand pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the inherent pore size of MOFs. This strategy allows the immobilization of glycoenzymes in MOFs for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising supports for the immobilization of enzymes, yet their applications are often limited by small pore apertures that constrain the size of encapsulated enzymes to below 5&#8197;nm. In this study, we introduced labile linkers (4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;boroxintriyl)&#8208;tribenzoate, TBTB) with dynamic boroxine bonds into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333, resulting in PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB with enhanced enzyme loading and protection capabilities. The selective breaking of B&#8722;O bonds creates defects in PCN&#8208;333, which effectively expands both window and cavity sizes, thereby unlocking hidden mesopores for enzyme encapsulation. Consequently, this strategy not only increases the adsorption kinetics of small enzymes (&lt;5&#8197;nm) such as cytochrome c (Cyt C) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but also enables the immobilization of various large&#8208;sized enzymes (&gt;5&#8197;nm), such as glycoenzymes. The glycoenzymes@PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB platform was successfully applied to synthesize thirteen complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability. The dynamic linker&#8208;mediated enzyme encapsulation strategy enables the immobilization of enzymes exceeding the inherent pore size of MOFs, thus broadening the scope of enzymatic catalytic reactions achievable with MOF materials.

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a Unique Bacterial Alkaloid Assembled by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase and non&#8208;Enzymatic Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pyrrolizwilline produced by XhpA&#8208;G was elucidated in Xenorhabdus hominickii using a promoter exchange approach together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli. We also report the structural characterization of XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline.







Abstract
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from Xenorhabdus hominickii, xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of X. hominickii promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).

Analysis of &lt;i&gt;X. hominickii&lt;/i&gt; promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;xhpA&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiOx/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.

         <title>Oscillating Structural Transformations in the Electrochemical Synthesis of Graphene Oxide from Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of electrochemical graphite oxidation in aqueous sulfuric acid reveal periodic structural changes of a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221;. The potential oscillations of the graphite electrode correlate with the appearance and disappearance of a solid phase identified as stage&#8208;1 GIC. The observed phenomenon can be considered as a new type of oscillating reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) is known to occur with potential oscillations, but the structural changes underlying these oscillations have remained unclear. In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates that the electrochemical synthesis of GO in aqueous H2SO4 can be described as an oscillating reaction. The transformation from graphite to GO proceeds through periodic structural oscillations that correlate with potential cycles. Stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is found only at the peak of the potential cycle, but not at the bottom of the cycle. Stage&#8208;1 GIC is formed in the first half&#8208;cycle from stage&#8208;2 GIC and then transforms into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221; (PGO) on the lower side of the potential cycle, after which the cycle restarts with the formation of a new portion of stage&#8208;1 GIC. Water&#8208;washing results in the transformation of PGO into water&#8208;swollen GO with d(001) ~11&#8197;&#197;. These periodic structural changes can be considered a new type of oscillating reaction. The presented results provide broad insights into the oscillating structural changes occurring during the anodic graphite oxidation in aqueous H2SO4 and allow to update of the mechanism of GO electrochemical formation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent Inhibitor of the Ferric Citrate Binding Protein FecB in Vibrio Bacteria</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron acquisition is a crucial factor for bacterial growth, and its transport process could be a promising target for antibacterial drugs. A potent molecular inhibitor of the ferric citrate binding protein FecB has been discovered. The findings provide new insight into the modulation of ferric ion acquisition pathways and their application to pathogen growth suppression.







Abstract
Infections caused by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria present a significant risk to human health worldwide. Novel strategies are needed to deal with the challenge caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Here, we report a new approach to combat infections by targeting iron&#8208;binding proteins to suppress bacterial growth. We investigated the function of the conserved periplasmic binding protein FecB from Vibrio alginolyticus. FecB was known to play a crucial role in the bacterial growth and to relate with biofilm formation. We then solved the crystal structures and elucidated the binding mechanism of FecB with ferric ion chelated by citrate. The results indicated that FecB binds weakly to one citrate molecule and strongly to the Fe3+&#8208;(citrate)2 complex. Based on these results, a structure&#8208;based virtual screening approach was conducted against FecB to identify small molecules that block ferric citrate uptake. Further evaluations in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that salvianolic acid C significantly suppressed bacterial growth, indicating that targeting bacterial nutrient absorption is a promising strategy for identifying potential antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Extending Shelf&#8208;Life of Two&#8208;Step Method Precursor Solutions through Targeted Regulation for Highly Efficient and Reproducible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The commercialization of PVSCs is hindered by poor reproducibility due to the chemical instability of the solution&#8208;processed materials. We first observe that the aging phenomenon is more pronounced in the precursor solution of the two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in the one&#8208;step method due to the difference in the used solvents. Here, an effective targeted strategy for precursor stabilization by introducing benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol (BDT) and decamethylferrocene (FcMe10) additives into the organic amine salt solution and the PbI2 precursor solution, thus extending the shelf&#8208;life of the two&#8208;step precursor solutions.







Abstract
Precursor solution aging process can cause significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Notably, we first observe that the aging phenomenon is more severe in the precursor of two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in one&#8208;step method due to that the protic solvent isopropanol facilitates amine&#8208;cation side reaction and iodide ions oxidation. Herein, we report a novel approach for selectively stabilizing both organic amine salt and lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solutions in two&#8208;step method. The introduction of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol into organic amine salt solution can mitigate amine&#8208;cation side reactions due to the formation of an acidic and reducing environment. Simultaneously, decamethylferrocene (FcMe10/FcMe+10) pair can act as a redox shuttle in PbI2 solution to concurrently oxidize Pb0 and reduce I2 in cyclic manner. Consequently, the PVSCs device fabricated from ameliorative precursor solutions demonstrates superior power conversion efficiency of 25.31&#8201;%, retaining 95&#8201;% of its efficiency after 21&#8197;days of solution aging. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency for 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination. This work establishes a fundamental guidance and scientific direction for the stabilization of two&#8208;step perovskite precursor solutions.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carburization of the Mo&#8208;based catalyst at 500&#8201;&#176;C is achieved in RWGS reaction. The surface O/Mo atomic ratio plays significant role in carburization, i.e., lower surface O/Mo atomic ratio is beneficial to carburization. In situ carburization induced by reaction product of CO strongly promotes the RWGS activity showing CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
In situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 600&#8201;&#176;C has been achieved over in situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100&#8197;h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3&#8201;% is observed.

         <title>Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Methyl Glycolide with Bifunctional Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst has been employed in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of optically active D&#8208; and L&#8208;methyl glycolide (MG) at room temperature. This innovative, metal&#8208;free catalytic approach leads to highly alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs), both in linear and star&#8208;shaped forms. The synthesized PLGAs exhibit high regioselectivity, consistent alternating structure, recyclability, and atactic microstructure, making them suitable for drug delivery applications.







Abstract
A bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst (Takemoto's catalyst), employing a metal&#8208;free approach, is presented for the regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of optically active (D and L) methyl glycolide (MG). In this study, a chiral version of Takemoto's catalyst efficiently promotes the ROP of MG at room temperature, yielding poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs) with predicted molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices (PDI&#8804;1.2). These PLGAs exhibit highly alternating structures without transesterification, as confirmed by 1H NMR, SEC, and MALDI&#8208;TOF analyses. Additionally, various macromolecular architectures, including linear and star&#8208;shaped PLGAs, were successfully synthesized using the corresponding multi&#8208;functional alcohol initiators while maintaining the same alternating structures and regioselectivity with PLGA obtained from benzyl alcohol as initiator. Computational studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of alternating PLGA formation, revealing two key transition states (TSs): TS&#8208;1, which implicates the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the initiator or propagating chain on the carbonyl carbon of MG, and TS&#8208;2, which involves the subsequent ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic ester. The results indicate that ring&#8208;opening occurs at both the glycolyl and lactyl sites, with a preference for the glycolyl site, as supported by experimental results. The resulting atactic PLGAs are amorphous, rendering them suitable for drug delivery applications.

         <title>Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual&#8208;Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) was developed based on apoferritin, which not only inhibited tumor growth through cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced immunity, but also possessed significant CuAAC reaction to synthesize a chemotherapeutic resveratrol analogue in situ for achieving targeted dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced systemic immune response.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition of the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>

         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the efficiency and substrate promiscuity of human ST6GalNAc enzymes along with a panel of enzyme modules, a library of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) containing an atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage including disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (DSLNT) was synthesized for the first time. Glycan microarray assays revealed broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif.







Abstract
Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, describe the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration of their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarrays, revealing broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insight for the functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Switching of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes on Cu(111) Evidenced by Spin&#8208;Flip Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Spin&#8208;state switching of a spin&#8208;crossover complex on Cu(111) induced by injection of tunneling electrons. The spin&#8208;state is readout from the low&#8208;voltage differential&#8208;conductance spectrum: the high&#8208;spin state exhibits magnetic excitation steps evolving with the application of a magnetic field while no spectroscopic feature is observed in the low&#8208;spin state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover compounds can be switched between two stable states with different magnetic moments, conformations, electronic, and optical properties, which opens appealing perspectives for technological applications including miniaturization down to the scale of single molecules. Although control of the spin states is crucial their direct identification is challenging in single&#8208;molecule experiments. Here we investigate the spin&#8208;crossover complex [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2] on a Cu(111) surface with scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Spin crossover of single molecules in dense islands is achieved via electron injection. Spin&#8208;flip excitations are resolved in scanning tunneling spectra in a magnetic field enabling the direct identification of the molecular spin state, and revealing the existence of magnetic anisotropy in the HS molecules.

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated molecular sieve@piperidine&#8208;decorated polyethylene separator is proposed for eliminating the H2O&#8208;derived HF directly by an acid&#8208;base mechanism rather than the elimination of H2O. This successfully enables LMBs with a LiF&#8208;rich SEI and stable cathode structure during cycling in an electrolyte with high H2O content.







Abstract
Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500&#8197;ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81&#8201;% capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.

         <title>Drug Discovery and Screening Tool Development for Tauopathies by Focusing on Pathogenic Tau Repeat 3 Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify the core region driving tauopathy, tau repeats within the microtubule&#8208;binding domain were synthesized and assessed for pathogenic traits. Repeat 3 initiated amyloid formation, cytotoxicity, and cognitive decline, with oligomeric aggregates showing pronounced neurotoxicity. This pathological form was utilized in a screening platform, leading to the discovery of tolcapone as a potent anti&#8208;tau agent. (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis)







Abstract
Comprehending early amyloidogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease (AD), the abnormal accumulation of tau protein is initiated by pathological tau seeds. Mounting evidence implies that the microtubule binding domain, consisting of three to four repeats, plays a pivotal role in this process, yet the exact region driving the formation of pathogenic species needs to be further scrutinized. Here, we chemically synthesized individual tau repeats to identify those exhibiting pathogenic prion&#8208;like characteristics. Notably, repeat 3 (R3) displayed a remarkable propensity to polymerize, form toxic filaments, and induce cognitive impairment, even in the absence of an aggregation&#8208;promoting inducer, highlighting its physiological relevance. Additionally, oligomeric R3 was identified as a particularly pathological form, prompting the establishment of a screening platform. Through screening, tolcapone was found to possess therapeutic efficacy against pathological tau aggregates in PS19 transgenic mice. This screening platform provides a valuable avenue for identifying compounds that selectively interact with peptides implicated in the progression of tauopathies.

         <title>Lithium Metal Recovery from Sea Water by a Flexible and Scalable Membrane with Lithium&#8208;Ion Exclusive Channels</title>

Extracting and obtaining lithium metal anodes from sea water for assembly of Li metal batteries by using single&#8208;channel Li ion&#8208;sieve membrane. The membrane effectively blocks water and interfering ions, allowing only Li ions to be transported.







Abstract
Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87&#215;107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04&#8201;% and a low energy consumption of 17.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgLi&#8722;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.

Breaking upper limit of CO2&#8208;uptake at low&#8208;pressure using porous materials is challenging due to the lack of multiple adsorption mechanisms. This study presents a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal ion&#8208;pairs in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite with the formation of unprecedented CO2&#8208;complexes even at 400&#8197;ppm and 298&#8197;K. The findings in the present study offer a new direction for efficient CO2 adsorbents.







Abstract
The efficient capture of low&#8208;pressure CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity. This electrostatic potential&#8208;engineered micropore can trap up to four CO2 molecules, forming M2+&#8722;(CO2)n&#8722;M2+ (n=0&#8211;4, M=Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes, where each CO2 molecule is stabilized by interactions between terminal oxygen (Ot) in CO2 and the AEM ions. Notably, the Ba2+ pair site exhibits higher thermodynamic stability for multiple adsorptions due to the optimal binding mode of Ba2+&#8722;Ot&#8722;Ba2+. Through high&#8208;accuracy energy calculations, we have established the relationship among structure, CO2 uptake, and operating temperature/pressure, demonstrating that the Ba2+ pair site can capture four CO2 molecules even at concentrations as low as 400&#8197;ppm and at 298&#8197;K. Three of the four molecules of CO2 trapped were removable at room temperature and under vacuum. The findings in the present study provide a new direction for developing efficient CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Simultaneous Inhibition of Vanadium Dissolution and Zinc Dendrites by Mineral&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>

Kaolin is demonstrated as an effective material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid electrolyte (KL&#8208;Zn), which simultaneously eliminates the interfacial side reactions of zinc anode and inhibits the vanadium dissolution of NH4V4O10 cathode, endowing high reversible capacity and superior cyclic stability for Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries.







Abstract
Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL&#8722;Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and high Zn2+ transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200&#8197;h can be achieved at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For the Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries, stable capacity of 245.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles along with high retention ratio of 81&#8201;%, manifesting KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH4V4O10 cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation&#8208;free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH4V4O10 cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte for Zn//MnO2 batteries and Zn//I2 batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral&#8208;based solid electrolyte.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Autotrophic Growth and Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion in Shewanella Oneidensis MR&#8208;1&#8201;through Light&#8208;Driven Electron Transfer</title>

Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 achieved months&#8208;long autotrophic growth and acetate production through CO2 fixation coupled to sulfur oxidation, driven by biogenic CdS nanoparticles under light.







Abstract
Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic method is developed to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates containing cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring as corns, in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. The obtained borates proved to be good electrocatalytic catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction towards HCOOH and C2H4.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reverse hydrogen spillover was mediated over operando stable Pd hydrides on tungsten carbides systems, which endows efficient and durable hydrogen evolution in proton exchange membrane electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, delivering the current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66&#8197;V and continuously running for 200&#8197;hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Exchange of CO2 with CO as Reactant Switches Selectivity in Photoreduction on Co&#8722;ZrO2 from C1&#8211;3 Paraffin to Small Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathways from CO2 to paraffin while from CO to C2H4 and C3H6 using Co&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst were switched. CO2 at the O vacancy on ZrO2 transformed into COH and hopped onto Co0 to be paraffin while CO and H competed on Co0 leading to preferable coupling of CH2 to olefins.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2,3 hydrocarbons completes a C&#8208;neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C2,3 paraffin and C2H4 from CO2 are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co0&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst converted CO2 into C1&#8211;3 paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C2H4 and C3H6 (6.0&#177;0.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, 70&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only under UV/Visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under 13CO and H2, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C2H4 and C3H6 up to 61&#8211;87&#8197;mol&#8201;%, attributed to the accumulation of CH2 species at the interface between Co0 nanoparticles and the ZrO2 surface. CO2 adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO2 surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co0 surface to yield C1&#8211;3 paraffin using either H2 or H2O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co0 surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO2, respectively. This comprehensive study elucidates intricate photocatalytic pathways governing the transformation of CO2 into paraffin and CO to olefins.

         <title>Growth Kinetics of Graphene on Cu(111) Foils from Methane, Ethyne, Ethylene, and Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We obtained the activation enthalpies of graphene island growth on Cu(111) foils using H2 and: CH4, and C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, respectively. The rate determining step (RDS) for CH4 is its gas phase decomposition to H and CH3. The RDS for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 is dehydrogenation on the Cu(111) surface yielding adsorbed C2H1, C2H3, and C2H5, respectively.







Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition of carbon precursors on Cu&#8208;based substrates at temperatures exceeding 1000&#8201;&#176;C is currently a typical route for the scalable synthesis of large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) films. Using molecules with higher activities than CH4 may afford lower growth temperatures that might yield fold&#8208; and wrinkle&#8208;free graphene. The kinetics of growth of graphene using hydrocarbons other than CH4 are of interest to the scientific and industrial communities. We measured the growth rates of graphene islands on Cu(111) foils by using C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4, respectively (each mixed with H2). From such kinetics data we obtain the activation enthalpy (&#916;H&#8800;) of graphene growth as shown in parentheses (C2H2 (0.93&#177;0.09&#8197;eV); C2H4 (2.05&#177;0.19&#8197;eV); C2H6 (2.50&#177;0.11&#8197;eV); CH4 (4.59&#177;0.26&#8197;eV)); C2Hy (y=2, 4, 6) show similar growth behavior but CH4 is different. Computational fluid dynamics and density functional theory simulations suggest that C2Hy differs from CH4 due to different values of adsorption energy and the lifetime of relevant carbon precursors on the Cu(111) surface. Combining experimental and simulation results, we find that the rate determining step (RDS) is the dissociation of the first C&#8722;H bond of CH4 molecules in the gas phase, while the RDS using C2Hy is the first dehydrogenation of adsorbed C2Hy that happens with assistance of H atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. By using C2H2 as the carbon precursor, high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal adlayer&#8208;free SLG films are achieved on Cu(111) foils at 900&#8201;&#176;C.

Novel NIR phosphors are constructed using a n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n molecular design strategy. Their phosphorescence can be readily modulated by altering the conjugated core structures. When incorporated into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host, these materials exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence ranging from 655&#8211;710&#8197;nm. Analysis of the exciton transition process reveals that the enhanced phosphorescence of the guest originates from the triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host material.







Abstract
Limited by the energy gap law, purely organic materials with efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence are rare and difficult to achieve. Additionally, the exciton transition process among different emitting species in host&#8211;guest phosphorescent materials remains elusive, presenting a significant academic challenge. Herein, using a modular nonbonding orbital&#8208;&#960; bridge&#8208;nonbonding orbital (n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n) molecular design strategy, we develop a series of heavy atom&#8208;free phosphors. Systematic modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores enables the construction of a library with tunable near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence from 655 to 710&#8197;nm. These phosphors exhibit excellent performance under ambient conditions when dispersed into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host matrix, achieving an extended lifetime of 11.25&#8197;ms and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 4.2&#8201;%. Notably, by eliminating the interference from host phosphorescence, the exciton transition process in hybrid materials can be visualized under various excitation conditions. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the improved phosphorescent performance of the guest originates from the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host, rather than from enhanced intersystem crossing efficiency between the guest singlet state and the host triplet state. The findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into constructing novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors and exploring emission mechanisms of host&#8211;guest materials.

         <title>Modulating Spin of Atomic Manganese Center for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

We report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. Introducing sulfur (S) changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, optimizing the oxygen intermediates adsorption.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising non&#8208;precious catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, the ORR SACs usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and in particular poor stability. Herein, we report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Introducing sulfur (S) to form Mn&#8722;S coordination changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which effectively optimizes the oxygen intermediates adsorption over the single Mn atomic sites and thus greatly improves the ORR activity.

         <title>Controllable Multi&#8208;Exciton Zero&#8208;Dimensional Antimony&#8208;Based Metal Halides for White&#8208;light Emission and &#946;&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

The [SbCl5]2&#8722; luminescent center structure is formed by self&#8208;assembly of SbCl3, methylamine hydrochloride, and 18&#8208;crown ether&#8208;6. This asymmetric structure can control the emission of singlet&#8208;triplet hybrid excitons by wavelength at room temperature. Under ultraviolet irradiation at 310&#8197;nm, it shows strong emission at 470&#8197;nm, white light emission under 340&#8197;nm irradiation, and strong emission at 570&#8197;nm under 370&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

Benefiting from this rational design, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C under practically necessary conditions, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries is severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfides shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3 interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid&#8208;electrolyte Na2TeS3 interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na2TeS3 interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted anilines was reported. With a simple Mo&#8208;catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access, were efficiently prepared in generally good yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. This process was robust, modular and ready for the syntheses of various valuable multi&#8208;substituted anilines.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram&#8208;scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza&#8208;Michael addition, [1,6]&#8208;proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di&#8208; or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of Helicene Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters in Molecular Solids and Bright Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic molecular chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence) of helicences are perfectly transferred from solution to the crystal state and to water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by encapsulating the chiral emitter in supramolecular small&#8208;molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). Furthermore, CPL brightness is enhanced by combination with a rhodamine antenna system.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from chiral molecules is attracting much attention due to its potential use in optical materials. However, formulation of CPL emitters as molecular solids typically deteriorates photophysical properties in the aggregated state leading to quenching and unpredictable changes in CPL behavior impeding materials development. To circumvent these shortcomings, a supramolecular approach can be used to isolate cationic dyes in a lattice of cyanostar&#8208;anion complexes that suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and which we hypothesize can preserve the synthetically&#8208;crafted chiroptical properties. Herein, we verify that supramolecular assembly of small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) allows translation of molecular ECD and CPL properties to solids. A series of cationic helicenes that display increasing chiroptical response is investigated. Crystal structures of three different packing motifs all show spatial isolation of dyes by the anion complexes. We observe the photophysical and chiroptical properties of all helicenes are seamlessly translated to water soluble nanoparticles by the SMILES method. Also, a DMQA helicene is used as FRET acceptor in SMILES nanoparticles of intensely absorbing rhodamine antennae to generate an 18&#8208;fold boost in CPL brightness. These features offer promise for reliably accessing bright materials with programmable CPL properties.

         <title>Nanoporous Heterojunction Photocatalysts with Engineered Interfacial Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous and chemically bonded S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by hybridization of two semiconducting MOFs, which exhibits excellent performance of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a promising strategy for sustainable production of ammonia (NH3). However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency with great room to improve regarding the charge carrier utilization and active site engineering. Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH3 production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL&#8208;125&#8722;NH2 (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron&#8208;deficient Co centers for improving N2 chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF&#8208;based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inversely relationships between vacancy volume in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives with their luminescent quantum yield and water stability have been established for the first time based on a series of [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite derivatives.







Abstract
Vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy&#8208;property relationship is crucial for designing related task&#8208;specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633;=vacancy) in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0&#8208;D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type VDPDs. Compared with the more commonly studied A2M(IV)X6&#9633;&#8208;type double perovskite (A=cation, M=metal ion, X=halide), [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242; features double vacancy sites. Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the photoluminescent quantum yield and V&#9633; in 0&#8208;D VDPDs. Additionally, structural transformation from A2SbCl5 to A3Sb2Cl9 was first reported, during which the novel &#8216;gate&#8208;opening&#8217; gas adsorption phenomenon was observed in VDPDs for the first time, as evidenced by &#8216;S&#8217;&#8208;shaped sorption isotherms for water vapor, indicating a cation&#8208;controlled water&#8208;vapor response behavior. A mixed&#8208;cation strategy was developed to modulate the humidity stability of VDPDs. Characterized by controllable water&#8208;responsive behavior and unique &#8216;on&#8208;off&#8208;on&#8217; luminescent switching, A2M(III)&#9633;X5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type materials show great promise for multi&#8208;level information anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides With Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 0D hybrid Zn halide family with high water&#8208;resistance and simultaneous integration of cyan STE emission and ultralong green afterglow was firstly synthesized by skillfully manipulating metal halides and organic phosphors as independent optical centers. Through regulating heavy atom effect to control the intersystem crossing rate and spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the dormant emitting units were significantly activated resulting in unprecedented high emission efficiency for both STE and afterglow emissions in 0D hybrid metal halides, which was applied for color&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption&#8208;decryption.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP=benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X=Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8722; effectively enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66&#8201;% and 54.62&#8201;% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94&#8197;ms and 0.308&#8197;&#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.

A newly synthesized complex, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, with the dihydrogen bond structural features, exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude greater than that of KCB9H10 and the highest ionic conductivity reported to date for hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors. This work offers a promising strategy for synthesizing solid K&#8208;ion conductors with enhanced conductivity.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries have caught increasing interest owing to their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high energy/power density. However, their development is generally constrained by the lack of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a new complex KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, synthesized by grinding and heating the mixture of potassium decahydrido&#8208;monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;decaborate (KCB9H10) and imidazole (C3H4N2) under mild conditions, to achieve the K&#8208;ion superionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The crystal structure was revealed as an orthorhombic lattice with the space group of Pna21 by FOX software. The diffusion properties for K+ in the crystal structure were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI&#8208;NEB) method. KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude higher than that of KCB9H10. This ionic conductivity is also the highest value of hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors reported. Moreover, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 demonstrated a K+ transference number of 0.96, an electrochemical stability window of 1.2 to 3.2&#8197;V vs. K/K+, and good stability against the K metal coated by a layer of potassium imidazolate (KIm). These great performances make KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 a promising K&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte.

A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a chaperone&#8208;derived Cu+&#8208;binding peptide featuring the conserved MTCGGC Cu+ binding motif, which self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers within cancer cells. These nanofibers have multiple MTCGGC Cu+&#8208;binding motifs on their surfaces, allowing for efficient capture of intracellular Cu+ ions. This process disrupts the Cu+ homeostasis network of cancer cells. Our study offers a novel therapeutic intervention targeting metal ion homeostasis in cancer.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MTCGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Confined Ultracapacitive Memristors with Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Pronounced physisorption of bioactive cations with a hydrophobic alkyl chain by porous carbons with a negative zeta potential results in confined cations, which triggers anion enrichment and depletion under electric polarization and enables rapid differential ionic memresistance behavior for cations with strong and weak interactions with porous carbons.







Abstract
The field of bioinspired iontronics, bridging electronic devices and ionic systems, has multiple biological applications. Carbon&#8208;based ultracapacitive devices hold promise for controlling bioactive ions via electric double layers due to their high&#8208;surface&#8208;area and biocompatible porous carbon electrodes. However, the interplay between complex bioactive ions and porous carbons remains unclear due to the variety of structures of bioactive ions present in biological systems. Herein, we investigate the adsorption behavior of a series of bioactive ammonium&#8208;based cations with varying alkyl chain lengths in nanoporous carbons. We find that strong physisorption results from the synergistic hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction between porous carbons (with a negative zeta potential) and bioactive cations. Bioactive cations with varying alkyl chain lengths can be irreversibly physically adsorbed and confined within nanoporous carbons resulting in anion enrichment and depletion during electric polarization. This situation, in turn, results in a characteristic memristive behavior in all&#8208;carbon capacitive ionic memristor devices. Our findings highlight the relationship between the resistance state of the memristor and ion adsorption mechanisms in all&#8208;carbon capacitive devices, which hold potential for future transmitter delivery, biointerfacing, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolved Protein Imaging Using Bifunctional Light&#8208;Up Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusions of protein&#8208;binding aptamers to the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer RhoBAST enabled visualization of GFP&#8208;tagged or endogenous proteins in both fixed and live mammalian cells. The fast exchange of the fluorogen yields intermittent fluorescence required for super&#8208;resolved imaging by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, a single&#8208;molecule localization technique.







Abstract
Efficient labeling methods for protein visualization with minimal tag size and appropriate photophysical properties are required for single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), providing insights into the organization and interactions of biomolecules in cells at the molecular level. Among the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers (FLAPs) originally developed for RNA imaging, RhoBAST stands out due to its remarkable brightness, photostability, fluorogenicity, and rapid exchange kinetics, enabling super&#8208;resolved imaging with high localization precision. Here, we expand the applicability of RhoBAST to protein imaging by fusing it to protein&#8208;binding aptamers. The versatility of such bifunctional aptamers is demonstrated by employing a variety of protein&#8208;binding aptamers and different FLAPs. Moreover, fusing RhoBAST with the GFP&#8208;binding aptamer AP3 facilitates high&#8208; and super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, which is particularly valuable in view of the widespread availability of plasmids and stable cell lines expressing proteins fused to GFP. The bifunctional aptamers compare favorably with standard antibody&#8208;based immunofluorescence protocols, as they are 7&#8208;fold smaller than antibody conjugates and exhibit higher bleaching&#8208;resistance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy in secondary mammalian cell lines and primary neurons by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, an SMLM protein imaging technique that leverages the transient binding of the fluorogenic rhodamine dye SpyRho to RhoBAST.

         <title>Phenyl Radical Activates Molecular Hydrogen Through Protium and Deuterium Tunneling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating the strong H2 bond is typically reserved for transition metals, and only a few main group systems can tackle this challenge. Here, we explore a phenyl radical mediated pathway utilizing the photolysis of iodobenzene. The phenyl radical leverages the high C&#8722;H bond energy of the forming benzene to drive H2 activation. Low&#8208;temperature experiments and dual level instanton computations reveal hydrogen tunneling as a critical factor.







Abstract
Activating dihydrogen, H2, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main&#8208;group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with H2&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical&#8208;mediated activation is problematic because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene&#8208;HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H2&#8208;doped neon matrix at 4.4&#8197;K despite a barrier of 7.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D2 isotopologue. When D2 molecules are allowed to diffuse, mono&#8208;deuterated benzene accumulates within hours. Computations using path integral&#8208;based instanton theory highlight that primarily the transferred hydrogen atom is moving during the reaction which greatly increases the tunneling probability. In excellent agreement with the experimental results, we predict significant tunneling rate constants for both isotopologues, H2 and D2, featuring a strong kinetic isotope effect of up to four orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures.

     alt="Phenyl Radical Activates Molecular Hydrogen Through Protium and Deuterium Tunneling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating the strong H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond is typically reserved for transition metals, and only a few main group systems can tackle this challenge. Here, we explore a phenyl radical mediated pathway utilizing the photolysis of iodobenzene. The phenyl radical leverages the high C&#8722;H bond energy of the forming benzene to drive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Low-temperature experiments and dual level instanton computations reveal hydrogen tunneling as a critical factor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating dihydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main-group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor-acceptor interactions with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical-mediated activation is problematic because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene-HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-doped neon matrix at 4.4&#8197;K despite a barrier of 7.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotopologue.

         <title>Engineering a Cu&#8208;Pd Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of atomically precise Cu&#8722;Pd dimers within the nodes of a Cu&#8208;MOF was confirmed through detailed XAS experiments. DFT calculations suggest that the Pd atom in the Cu&#8722;Pd dimer modulates the binding energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the neighboring Cu site, leading to enhanced selectivity for electrocatalytic CO production during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC=benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8722;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.

         <title>Cyclic Acetals as Expanding Monomers to Reduce Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of a thiol and ene is depicted. After the thiol&#8208;ene reaction a thioether bond is formed resulting in a shorter interatomic distance. This shrinkage leads to stress in the polymer which can be reduced by radical&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;rearrangements catalyzed by thiols. A compact cyclic acetal extent to a longer linear ester. This volumetric expansion is counteracting the shrinkage resulting from the thiol&#8208;ene reaction.







Abstract
Polarity&#8208;reversal catalysts (PRCs) for hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer reactions have been known in radical chemistry for more than 60&#8197;years but are rarely described and utilized in the field of photopolymerization up to now. Herein, we present the use of thiols in a unique dual function as thiol&#8208;ene click reagents and as polarity&#8208;reversal catalyst (PRC) for the radical&#8208;mediated redox rearrangements of benzylidene acetals. During the rearrangement reaction, cyclic benzylidene acetals are transformed into benzoate esters leading to a significant volumetric expansion to reduce thermoset shrinkage. We were able to show that this expansion on a molecular level reduces shrinkage and polymerization stress but does not significantly affect the (thermo&#8722;)mechanical properties of the cross&#8208;linked networks. One of the key advantages of this process lies in its simplicity. No additives like sensitizers or combinations of different initiators (radical and cationic) are needed. Furthermore, the same light source can be used for both the polymerization reaction and expansion through rearrangement. Additionally, the applied photoinitiator enables spatial and temporal control of the polymerization; thus, the developed system can be an excellent platform for additive manufacturing processes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugational path are obtained via heavier acyclic diene metathesis of bis(digermene)s. High solubility and interchain dispersion interactions allow for near&#8208;infinite chains and deposition as thin films with ordered lamellar bundles. With the absorption in the visible range corresponding to small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, this new class of conjugated materials is promising for various applications.







Abstract
Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds&#8212;albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). UV/Vis and NMR data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals interfaces of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures are tuned through controlled functionalization of the bottom graphene layer. Adjusting the size of the functional groups enables nm&#8208;scale modification of interlayer distances. Both the size and electronic properties of the functional groups are key to regulating charge transport, with size being particularly decisive.







Abstract
Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Photoswitches for High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and cis&#8208;trans isomerization, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven solid&#8208;state fluorescent photoswitch has been developed. It was obtained by incorporating a bulky naphthalimide group into a salicylaldimine. The photoswitch shows triple fluorescence switching, showing potential application in high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Developing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches in the solid state remains an enormous challenge in smart materials. Such photoswitches are obtained from salicylaldimines through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and subsequent cis&#8208;trans isomerization strategies. By incorporating a bulky naphthalimide fluorophore into a Schiff base, three photoswitches achieve dual&#8208;mode changes (both in color and fluorescence) in the solid state. In particular, the optimal one generates triple fluorescence changing from green, to yellow and finally to orange upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This switching process is fully reversible and can be repeated at least 10&#8197;times without obvious attenuation, suggesting its good photo&#8208;fatigue resistance. Mechanism studies reveal that the naphthalimide group not only enables the tuning of multicolor with an additional emission, but also induces a folded structure, reducing molecular stacking and facilitating ESIPT and cis&#8208;trans isomerization. As such, photopatterning, ternary encoding and transient information recording and erasing are successfully developed. The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;Activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could be incorporated onto the cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for specific hypoxia labeling in diverse cell lines, particularly in the monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in zebrafish models.







Abstract
Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia's role in tumorigenesis is highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression, offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction: Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Axially Chiral Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has been realized via vinyl cation pathway, enabling the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles. This protocol continues the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, the constructed axially chiral carbazoles are applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement Towards a White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Adamantane&#8208;Type Cluster Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an ethylene bridge into a quaternary adamantane&#8208;type cluster core {Si(CH2)n(C2H4)mSn3S3} (n/m=3/0 or 2/1) causes distinct distortions, which the molecules escape by an unprecedented dimerization of the cluster cores. This structural change affects the (extreme) nonlinear optical properties of such white&#8208;light emitting materials, as shown by a combined experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study.







Abstract
Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T=group 14 element, E=group 16 element, R=organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode. This effect is enhanced if the cluster core is varied from a binary to a more complex composition. To further explore this phenomenon, we synthesized clusters with a multinary R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217; composition, including isolobal replacement of E with CH2, in [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}3] (1, Np=naphthyl). When expanding one of the CH2 moieties to a C2H4 group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non&#8208;isolable adamantane&#8208;like cluster [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}] (2) to [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}]2 (3), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric 1 and dimeric 3, show white&#8208;light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.

We herein proposed and demonstrated a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target a highly porous and robust HOF material (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a), exhibiting one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas for extraordinary high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage capacities.







Abstract
Development of highly porous and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage remains a grand challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target highly porous and robust HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a) for extraordinary CH4 and H2 storage. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a features a minimized twofold interpenetration with double&#8208;walled structure, in which multiple supramolecular interactions are existed between the interpenetrated walls. This structural configuration can notably enhance the framework robustness while maintaining its high porosity, affording one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of 3102&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1976&#8197;m2&#8201;cm&#8722;3 among the reported HOFs so far. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a thus exhibits an extremely high volumetric H2 uptake of 43.6&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar and working capacity of 41.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under combined swing conditions (77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar&#8594;160&#8197;K/5&#8197;bar), and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8211;100&#8197;bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 270&#8197;K (or 296&#8197;K), outperforming most of the reported porous organic materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on CH4&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH4 storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super&#8208;hydrophobicity, and easy recovery, ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a is placed among the most promising materials for H2 and CH4 storage applications.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the detailed proton&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.







Abstract
Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace zwitterionic additive endows the Zn||Zn cells with a cycling life of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And the Zn||I2 full cell exhibits 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And even at 85&#8201;% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95&#8201;% even after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Initiated Difunctionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane via Photoinduced Polarity Match Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, XB adducts are formed between BzI&#8208;tethered amines and amines via the halogen bonding. After photofragmentation, the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals are generated and subsequently undergo radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding BCP radicals that participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility of this approach is underscored by a series of valuable transformations.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), recognized as a bioisostere for para&#8208;disubstituted benzene, has gained widespread interest in drug development due to its ability to enhance the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals. In this work, we introduce a photoinduced, halogen bonding&#8208;initiated, metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing various BCP derivatives. This method involves the generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals via halogen&#8208;bonding adducts. These undergo selective radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding electrophilic BCP radicals that subsequently participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility and practicality of this metal&#8208;free approach are underscored by its broad substrate scope, which includes late&#8208;stage functionalization and a series of valuable transformations, all conducted under mild reaction conditions.

The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC was fabricated for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC@NC could obviously enhance catalytic performance of ORR and OER because it can modify coordination environment surrounding Fe atoms and accordingly realize an optimization of the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs exhibit superior peak power density and specific capacity in comparison to Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high energy density and rich zinc raw materials. It is a low&#8208;cost, green and sustainable energy storage device. At present, one of the key technologies that hinder the large&#8208;scale application of ZABs is the design and fabrication oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts with excellent performance, especially the non&#8208;platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC with high performance has been fabricated by a one&#8208;step pyrolysis and then the electrochemical oxidization. The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC, and the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed the obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V for ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.

         <title>Constructing Quasi&#8208;Single Ion Conductors by a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Polymer to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer is used to construct a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating the Zn anodes, and thereby inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode, prevented the side reaction, elevated the Zn ion transference number, suppressed the formation of space charge regions and stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the Zn anode remains facing challenges. Here, we report a cyclodextrin polymer (P&#8208;CD) to construct quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating and protecting Zn anodes. The P&#8208;CD coating layer inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode and prevented the side reaction of metal anodes. More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host&#8211;guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P&#8208;CD achieved a 70.6&#8197;times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full&#8208;cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230&#8197;cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.

         <title>Revealing the Dynamic Evolution of Electrolyte Configuration on the Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Visualizing (De) Solvation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the charging process of lithium cobalt oxide cathode, Li+ undergoes solvation, and Li+&#8208;complexes aggregate in the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, forming a concentrated interface. As the voltage increases, the intensified interfacial electric field exerts greater electro&#8208;repulsion on Li+, forming a diluted interface.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for improving cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high charging cut&#8208;off voltages. However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti&#8208;synergy effect between Li+&#8208;solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated&#8208;Li+. The Li+ solvation in the charging process facilitates the construction of a concentrated (Li+&#8208;solvent/anion&#8208;rich) interface and anion&#8208;derived CEI, while the repulsive force derived from interfacial electric field induces the formation of a diluted (solvent&#8208;rich) interface and solvent&#8208;derived CEI. Modifying the electrochemical protocols and electrolyte formulation, we regulate the &#8220;inflection voltage&#8221; arising from the anti&#8208;synergy effect and prolong the lifetime of the concentrated interface, which further improves the functionality of CEI architecture.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;activated alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl boronic acids is presented. A wide variety of alkyl aryl ketones is obtained in good yields, and the chemistry is easily applicable to stable and radiocarbon isotope labeling.

Here we present an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling for direct access to alkyl aryl ketones from readily accessible redox&#8208;activated tetrachlorophthalimide esters and aryl boronic acids. The methodology, which is run employing only 2.5&#8197;equivalents of CO and simple Ni(II) salts as the metal source, exhibits a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Furthermore, this carbonylation chemistry provides an easy switch between isotopologues for stable (13CO) and radioactive (14CO) isotope labeling, allowing its adaptation to the late&#8208;stage isotope labeling of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Based on DFT calculations as well as experimental evidence, a catalytic cycle is proposed involving a carbon&#8208;centered radical formed via nickel(I)&#8208;induced outer&#8208;sphere decarboxylative fragmentation of the redox&#8208;active ester.

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction for the efficient synthesis angularly fused M/5/N tricyclic skeletons (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) has been explored. In this novel transformation, the priority of ring expansion could be predicted by the rational design of the ring size and substituents. Employing the reaction as a key step, we finished total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.







Abstract
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33&#8197;examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95&#8201;%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.

         <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks with Superhelical Nanostructures Enable Efficient Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers were synthesized by manipulating the lengths of alkyl chains in enantiopure BINOL&#8208;based organic linkers. The resulting 3D chiral COFs formed right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed superhelix fibers with macroscopic chirality. These nanofibers exhibit significantly enhanced enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding and a remarkable chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.







Abstract
Despite significant advancements in fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse morphologies, creating COFs with superhelical nanostructures remains challenging. We report here the controlled synthesis of homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers by manipulating pendent alkyl chain lengths in organic linkers. This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs 13&#8208;OR with a 10&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, nPr, nBu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. COF&#8208;13&#8208;OEt exhibits macroscopic chirality as right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non&#8208;helical morphologies. Time&#8208;tracking shows a self&#8208;assembly process from non&#8208;helical strands to single&#8208;stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin&#8208;filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non&#8208;helical analogs.

         <title>Operando Spectroelectrochemistry Unravels the Mechanism of CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction by an Fe Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO by an iron porphyrin using IR and UV/Visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry provides operando insights at molecular scale. In addition to the main catalytic cycle involving FeI species as resting state, a secondary pathway involving the protonation of the porphyrin ligand into a phlorin ligand at the Fe0 level was identified.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8722;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV/Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Cyclic Sulfoximines as Methyl and Perdeuteromethyl Transfer Agents and Their Applications in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoredox catalysis, novel heterocyclic sulfoximines serve as methyl and perdeuteromethyl radical sources. The reagents are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use. Various radical acceptors can be applied leading to products in good yields. Up&#8208;scaling has been achieved by using a photoflow reactor. Physicochemical studies suggest a photoredox process.







Abstract
Benzo[1,3,2]dithiazole&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;trioxides are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use reagents. In photoredox catalysis, they generate methyl and perdeuteromethyl radicals which can add to a variety of radical acceptors, including olefins, acrylamides, quinoxalinones, isocyanides, enol silanes, and N&#8208;Ts acrylamide. As byproduct, a salt is formed which can be regenerated to the original methylating agent. Flow chemistry provides an option for reaction scale&#8208;up further underscoring the synthetic usefulness of these methylation reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) pathway induced by photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Mild and Scalable Conditions for the Solvothermal Synthesis of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized in hours in the same mixture of n&#8208;butanol, water and acetic acid while stirring. The method is convenient, green, tolerates a wide variety of monomers, and can produce over ten grams of covalent organic framework in one batch.







Abstract
A convenient method was developed that allows for the synthesis of highly crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in hours. The use of an apolar solvent in combination with a precise amount of water and acetic acid was crucial to obtain materials of optimal quality. Fifteen different COFs could be produced under the same reaction conditions, using a green solvent mixture of n&#8208;butanol, acetic acid and water at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8197;hours with stirring. The crystallinity of the COFs produced in this manner is similar or better than that obtained by traditional solvothermal synthesis. The method could be easily scaled to synthesize over ten grams of COF in one batch. Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy gave insight in the role of the solvent on the aggregation of COF nanosheets and the resulting crystallinity, porosity and robustness of the material.

         <title>In Situ Generation of 1&#8208;Acetylpyrene as a Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for the Thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpected discovery of the photosensitization properties of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction enabled the limitations of this hetero&#8208;cycloaddition reaction to be tackled in terms of substrate scope and efficiency. The synthesis of a wide range of thietanes from intrinsically unstable thiocarbonyls was made possible by the use of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of both the thiocarbonyl substrate and the photocatalyst.







Abstract
The thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction represents a straightforward approach to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report herein a visible&#8208;light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls though a Norrish type&#8197;II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with various non&#8208;volatile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocarbonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer based mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Boron Cluster Anions Dissolve En Masse in Lipids Causing Membrane Expansion and Thinning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic dodecaborate cluster anions adsorb efficiently on lipid mono&#8208; and bilayers, affecting the physical properties of the membrane more strongly than conventional chaotropic anions. Cluster immersion in the bilayer leads to a reorganization of the lipid chains, affording hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic membranes with expanded surface area per lipid as well as thinner membranes with increased fluidity.







Abstract
Boron clusters are applied in medicinal chemistry because of their high stability in biological environments and intrinsic ability to capture neutrons. However, their intermolecular interactions with lipid membranes, which are critical for their cellular delivery and biocompatibility, have not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we combine different experimental methods &#8211; Langmuir monolayer isotherms at the air&#8211;water interface, calorimetry (DSC, ITC), and scattering techniques (DLS, SAXS) &#8211; with MD simulations to evaluate the impact of closo&#8208;dodecaborate clusters on model membranes of different lipid composition. The cluster anions interact strongly with zwitterionic membranes (POPC and DPPC) via the chaotropic effect and cause pronounced expansions of lipid monolayers. The resulting lipid membranes contain up to 33&#8197;mol&#8201;% and up to 52 weight&#8201;% of boron cluster anions even at low aqueous cluster concentrations (1&#8197;mM). They show high (&#956;M) affinity to the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interface, affecting the structuring of the lipid chains, and therefore triggering a sequence of characteristic effects: (i) an expansion of the surface area per lipid, (ii) an increase in membrane fluidity, and (iii) a reduction of bilayer thickness. These results aid the design of boron cluster derivatives as auxiliaries in drug design as well as transmembrane carriers and help rationalize potential toxicity effects.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure undergo bidirectional thermal isomerization in addition to bidirectional photochemical isomerization due to a small energy difference between the open&#8208; and the closed&#8208;ring isomers. Kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the detailed mechanisms of the photochemical and thermal reactions. Using these unique properties, both light&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing and heat&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing systems were demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo&#8208;functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo&#8208;photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed&#8208;ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza&#8208;diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions but also thermal ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy&#8208;level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed&#8208;ring isomers adopt the same molecular structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring&#8208;closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza&#8208;diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.

         <title>Inside Cover: Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochromic properties of aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure were investigated by Shota Hamatani, Daichi Kitagawa, and Seiya Kobatake in their Research Article (e202414121). Unlike typical diarylethene molecules, the aza&#8208;diarylethenes showed both photochemically and thermally reversible electrocyclic reactions. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by DFT calculations, offering insights for future research on photoswitches.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiosilvatins are a class of biologically active dithiodiketopiperazine natural products. In their Research Article (e202412397), Daniel Strand and co&#8208;workers describe a first, collective, synthesis of thiosilvatins, introducing methods and tactics to overcome stereochemical issues in dithiodiketopiperazine synthesis. The artwork depicts thiosilvatins emerging from and escaping an abyss of inaccessibility and structural ambiguity.

         <title>Back Cover: Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic boroxine linkers were incorporated into the mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) PCN&#8208;333, which creates defects and expands pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the intrinsic MOF pores. As reported by Xing Zhang, Shuai Yuan et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202409951), this strategy facilitates the immobilization of glycoenzymes for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating both high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.

Mechanochemistry &#8230;. &#8230; can be used in the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as reported by Xavier Ottenwaelder, Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263;, Dmytro F. Perepichka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404539). Based on this concept the first mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;based 2D and 3D COFs with high surface area of up to 2,500 m2 g&#8722;1 was developed. The cover picture shows the structure of the monomers and the COF with the electron micrograph of the mechanochemically prepared COF in the background.

         <title>A Smart Design of Non&#8208;Noble Catalysts for Sustainable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper highlights a smart sustainable Ni@TiOx catalyst, Ni encapsulated in TiOx, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as reported by Gong and co&#8208;workers. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in PDH, achieving 94&#8201;% propylene selectivity and high stability. This design offers a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, with potential for broader industrial applications.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an important process for propylene synthesis, relies on expensive noble metals or highly toxic oxides as catalysts. In a recent publication, Gong and co&#8208;workers report a breakthrough discovery for PDH by introducing a sustainable catalyst composed of titanium oxide overlayers encapsulating nickel nanoparticles, termed Ni@TiOx. This innovative catalyst showcases exceptional performance in PDH, exhibiting high propylene selectivity and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The study elucidates the role of defective TiOx overlayers and the electronic promotional effect of subsurface Ni in enhancing catalytic activity, translating a traditional model catalyst system into a sustainable industrial catalyst for low&#8208;carbon energy and the chemical industry.

         <title>Carbonylation Reactions at Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with an Adjacent Heteroatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the most recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving heteroatom adjacent carbon radicals, specifically including the heteroatoms oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The reaction mechanisms are also described in detail.







Abstract
Heteroatoms are essential to living organisms and present in almost all molecules with medicinal usage. The catalytic functionalization at the carbon&#8208;centered radical with an adjacent heteroatom provides an effective way to value added moiety while retaining the unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of heteroatoms, which can promote the development of pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. Carbonylative transformation was discovered nearly a century ago which is an efficient method for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules with potent applications in both industry and academia. Despite numerous advances in new reaction development, carbonylative transformation involving adjacent heteroatom carbon radical remain a subject that deserves to be discussed. In this minireview, we systematically summarized and discussed the recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving carbon&#8208;centered radicals with an adjacent heteroatom, including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The related reaction mechanism was also discussed.

Sunlight has long been the primary energy source for our planet. This minireview highlights its importance and investigates the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. It examines fundamental processes, including the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, the review assesses various carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based complexes photocatalysts and their roles in driving chemical reactions. It further provides insights into possible evolutionary pathways for Earth, emphasizing the pivotal influence of carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based photocatalysts in the development of Earth.







Abstract
Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C&#8722;N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in development of Earth.

Phototheranostics of infectious diseases by utilizing NIR&#8208;II AIEgens has been developed at a tremendous pace. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts in this area in terms of molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and promising prospects.







Abstract
Pathogenic infectious diseases have persistently posed significant threats to public health. Phototheranostics, which combines the functions of diagnostic imaging and therapy, presents an extremely promising solution to block the spread of pathogens as well as the outbreak of epidemics owing to its merits of a wide&#8208;spectrum of activity, high controllability, non&#8208;invasiveness, and difficult to acquire resistance. Among multifarious phototheranostic agents, second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are notable by virtue of their deep penetration depth, excellent biocompatibility, balanced radiative and nonradiative decay and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance, making them an ideal option for combating pathogens. This minireview provides a systematical summary of the latest advancements in NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with emphasis on the molecular design and nanoplatform formulation to fulfill high&#8208;efficiency in treating bacterial and viral pathogens, classified by disease models. Then, the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future research directions are presented to facilitate the further progress of this emerging field.

This review outlines the recent advances of organic cocrystals in emerging cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications during the nearest five years including PTC, RTP, TADF, CPL, OSSLs, NIR sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses, along with the structure&#8211;property relationship, limitations, prospects and some inspirations for future investigations.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals, representing one type of new functional materials, have gathered significant interest in various engineering areas. Owing to their diverse stacking modes, rich intermolecular interactions and abundant functional components, the physicochemical properties of organic cocrystals can be tailored to meet different requirements and exhibit novel characteristics. The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of organic cocrystals in both fundamental characteristics and various applications. Beyond the typical properties like ambipolarity, emission tuning ability, ferroelectricity, etc. that are previously well demonstrated, many novel, impressive and cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications of cocrystals are also emerged and advanced recently. Especially during the nearest five years, photothermal conversion, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, thermally activated delay fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence, organic solid&#8208;state lasers, near&#8208;infrared sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses have been reported. In this review, these new properties are carefully summarized. Besides, some neoteric architecture and methodologies, such as host&#8211;guest structures and machine learning&#8208;based screening, are introduced. Finally, the potential future developments and expectations for organic cocrystals are discussed for further investigations on multiple functions and applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroxine&#8208;based COFs including 3D COF&#8208;102 with high porosity, are now accessible by simple, efficient, and rapid mechanochemical synthesis, in a process amenable to in situ monitoring and multi&#8208;gram scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca. 2,500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a&gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10&#8197;g).

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synthesis of cell&#8208;permeable NADs bearing fluorescent (TAMRA) or affinity (desthiobiotin) tag and their utility for ADP&#8208;ribosylation studies in living cells. Cell&#8208;permeability was achieved by modification with cholesterol or polyarginine. The probes were accepted by all tested PARP enzymes. The optimized desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled NAD+ was used for affinity enrichment and identification of proteins ADP&#8208;ribosylated upon oxidative stress.







Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds without transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Our strategy surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate scopes, or yields. Mechanistic studies, DFT, and IBO calculations revealed a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and a hydride shift reaction pathway. The key role of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amide was disclosed.







Abstract
Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X=halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.

The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;based chemistries enables ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide redox couple with high concentration of 0.8&#8197;M to access a broad range of physicochemical and electrochemical properties at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C that represents the lowest operating temperature for ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte reported so far.







Abstract
Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C and of 0.8&#8197;M at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and maintains stable for ~4200&#8197;cycles (~4200&#8197;hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800&#8197;cycles (~800&#8197;hours) at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Clean One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Structurally Ordered Linear, Monocyclic, and Bicyclic Oligosiloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetraacetoxysilanes reacted with silanols or silanediols under base&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to selectively generate acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes. Cyclotetrasiloxanes and bicyclic pentasiloxanes with precisely constructed structures were obtained from successive one&#8208;pot reactions of a tetraacetoxysilane with various silanediols. The acetoxy&#8208;containing oligosiloxanes can serve as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and as new building blocks for heat&#8208;resistant materials.







Abstract
A highly selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction between Si&#8722;OAc (AcO=acetoxy) and Si&#8722;OH compounds that generates unsymmetrical and symmetrical oligosiloxanes concurrent with the release of acetic acid has been developed. The high selectivity arises from the reactivity difference that depends on the varying number of acetoxy groups present, thus facilitating a clean one&#8208;pot synthesis of oligosiloxanes. For instance, the reactions of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, or tetraacetoxysilanes with silanols furnish acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes in high yield. Two equivalents of tetraacetoxysilane can react with various silanediols to form 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexaacetoxytrisiloxanes, which subsequently react with a second molecule of a silanediol to selectively afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraacetoxycyclotetrasiloxanes. The cyclotetrasiloxanes further react with a third molecule of silanediol to provide unprecedented bicyclic pentasiloxanes with acetoxy groups at the bridgehead silicon atoms. Applications of the acetoxy&#8208;containing products as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and new building blocks for highly heat&#8208;resistant materials are demonstrated.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF3]&#8722;, formed in the reaction of OF2 with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF3]&#8722; is similar to that in [F3]&#8722;.







Abstract
Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF3]&#8722;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M=Na&#8722;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8901;&#8722;.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide&#8208;based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxyamides.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation at Chromium(I): An 11&#8208;Electron Complex Cleaving Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped 11&#8208;electron chromium(I) complex was stabilized by a (PNP) ligand and fully characterized. An sp&#8208;sp carbon&#8208;carbon bond scission in dialkynes was found to occur at the vacant in&#8208;plane coordination site through the formation of a dinuclear dimer.







Abstract
An 11&#8208;electron T&#8208;shaped chromium(I) complex was obtained by reduction of a PNP&#8208;supported chromium(II) iodide complex. Its d5 high&#8208;spin electronic structure was characterized employing paramagnetic NMR, EPR, UV/Vis and magnetic measurements (SQUID). The complex readily reacts with conjugated dialkynes to cleave the internal C&#8722;C bond, forming the respective acetylide complexes. Varying the alkyne substituents enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium intermediates which thermally convert to the products.

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous reactions of water in either highly charged nanodrops formed by electrospray ionization, or less highly charged microdroplets formed by a vibrating mesh screen nebulizer were investigated. No evidence for ionized water dimer, nor oxidation products of the radical scavengers caffeine or melatonin was observed over a wide range of droplet size, net charge, and lifetime, indicating that water is stable at the surface of unactivated water droplets.







Abstract
Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8901;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8901; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization. Here, aqueous droplets are formed both by nanoelectrospray, which produces highly charged nanodrops with initial diameters ~100&#8197;nm, and a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which produces 2&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m droplets that are initially less highly charged. The lifetimes of these droplets range from 10s of &#956;s to 560&#8197;ms and the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios span ~100&#8208;fold range. No ions at m/z 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.

         <title>An Automated Electrochemical Flow Platform to Accelerate Library Synthesis and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated electrochemical flow platform for operator&#8208;free data generation is presented, leveraging slug&#8208;based reaction mixtures for low material consumption. This platform was employed in the context of library synthesis of 44 medicinal chemistry&#8208;relevant compounds. The platform was also used to optimize one previously unsuccessful target via DoE, leading to a 6&#8208;fold yield increment.







Abstract
Automated batch and flow setups are well&#8208;established for high throughput experimentation in both thermal chemistry and photochemistry. However, the development of automated electrochemical platforms is hindered by cell miniaturization challenges in batch and difficulties in designing effective single&#8208;pass flow systems. In order to address these issues, we have designed and implemented a new, slug&#8208;based automated electrochemical flow platform. This platform was successfully demonstrated for electrochemical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of E3 ligase binders with diverse amines (44 examples), which were subsequently transferred to a continuous&#8208;flow mode for confirmation and isolation, showing its applicability for medicinal chemistry purposes. To further validate the versatility of the platform, Design of Experiments (DoE) optimization was performed for an unsuccessful library target. This optimization process, fully automated by the platform, resulted in a remarkable 6&#8208;fold increase in reaction yield.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin is reported along with a collective approach to ten related thiosilvatins. The described methods offer a practical blueprint for exploring the dithiotiketopiperazine pharmacophore with absolute and relative stereocontrol.







Abstract
Thiosilvatins are a family of biologically active sulfenylated diketopiperazine natural products. The first members were reported over 40&#8197;years ago, but total synthesis of a thiosilvatin has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first, collective, synthesis of the parent epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin and ten related thiosilvatins. Several of the targets are structurally revised. A catalytic asymmetric sulfenylation of triketopiperazines efficiently controls absolute configuration at the thioaminal units. Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite cis&#8208;orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/O&#8208;prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late&#8208;stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D&#8208;pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.
