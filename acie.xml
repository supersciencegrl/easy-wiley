      <title>Ethylene Dehydroaromatization over Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Catalysts: Nature and Role of Gallium Speciation</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysis in zeolites possessing both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid sites offers unique opportunities to tailor shape selectivity and enhance catalyst performance. Here, we examine the impact of framework and extra&#8208;framework gallium species on enriched aromatics production in zeolite ZSM&#8208;5. In this study we compare three distinct methods of preparing Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and reveal direct (single step) synthesis leads to optimal catalysts compared to post&#8208;synthesis methods. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization, catalyst testing, and density functional theory calculations, we show that Ga Lewis acid sites strongly favor aromatization. Our findings also suggest Ga(framework) &#8211; Ga(extra&#8208;framework) pairings, which can only be achieved in materials prepared by direct synthesis, are the most energetically favorable sites for reaction pathways leading to aromatics. Calculated acid site exchange energies between extra&#8208;framework Ga at framework sites comprised of either Al or Ga reveal a site&#8208;specific preference for stabilizing Lewis acids, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental measurements. These findings indicate the possibility of tailoring Lewis acid siting by the placement of Ga heteroatoms at distinct tetrahedral sites in the zeolite framework, which can have a marked impact on catalyst performance relative to conventional H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5.</dc:description>

      <title>Making or breaking metal&#8208;dependent catalytic activity: The role of stammers in designed three&#8208;stranded coiled coils</title>
      <dc:description>While many life critical reactions would be infeasibly slow without metal cofactors, a detailed understanding of how protein structure can influence catalytic activity remains elusive. Using de novo designed 3&#8208;stranded coiled coils (TRI and Grand peptides formed using a heptad repeat approach), we examine how the insertion of a three residue discontinuity, known as a stammer insert, directly adjacent to a (His)3 metal binding site alters catalytic activity. The stammer, which locally alters the twist of the helix, significantly increases copper catalyzed nitrite reductase activity (CuNiR). In contrast, the well&#8208;established zinc catalyzed carbonic anhydrase activity (p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate, pNPA) is effectively ablated. This study illustrates for the first time how perturbation of the protein sequence using non&#8208;coordinating and non&#8208;acid base residues in the helical core can perturb metalloenzyme activity through the simple expedient of modifying the helical pitch adjacent to the catalytic center.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoimpacts at Active and Partially Active Electrodes: Insights and Limitations</title>
      <dc:description>While the electrochemical nanoimpact technique has recently emerged as a method of studying single entities, its scope is limited by its typical requirement of a catalytically active particle impacting an inert electrode. We show that an active particle&#8211;active electrode type scheme can provide valuable mechanistic insight into electrochemical reactions. When an individual Pt electrocatalyst adsorbs to the surface of a partially active electrode, further reduction of electrode&#8208;produced species can proceed on the nanocatalyst. Furthermore, current transients obtained during hydrogen evolution allow simultaneous measurement of the Pt catalyst over different length scales, the size dependency suggesting H atom intercalation as a plausible catalytic deactivation mechanism. Although experimental and computational results show that outer&#8208;sphere redox probes are unproductive for particle characterization, the breadth of inner&#8208;sphere electrochemical reactions makes this a promising method for understanding the properties of catalytic nanomaterials, one at a time.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the electrochemical nanoimpact technique has recently emerged as a method of studying single entities, its scope is limited by its typical requirement of a catalytically active particle impacting an inert electrode. We show that an active particle&#8211;active electrode type scheme can provide valuable mechanistic insight into electrochemical reactions. When an individual Pt electrocatalyst adsorbs to the surface of a partially active electrode, further reduction of electrode&#8208;produced species can proceed on the nanocatalyst. Furthermore, current transients obtained during hydrogen evolution allow simultaneous measurement of the Pt catalyst over different length scales, the size dependency suggesting H atom intercalation as a plausible catalytic deactivation mechanism. Although experimental and computational results show that outer&#8208;sphere redox probes are unproductive for particle characterization, the breadth of inner&#8208;sphere electrochemical reactions makes this a promising method for understanding the properties of catalytic nanomaterials, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>PhotoAffinity Bits: A photoaffinity&#8208;based fragment screening platform for efficient identification of protein ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in genomic analyses enable the identification of new proteins that are associated with disease. To validate these targets, tool molecules are required to demonstrate that a ligand can have a disease&#8208;modifying effect. Currently, as tools are reported for only a fraction of the proteome, platforms for ligand discovery are essential to leverage insights from genomic analyses. Fragment screening offers an efficient approach to explore chemical space. We present a fragment screening platform, termed PhABits (PhotoAffinity Bits), which utilises a library of photoreactive fragments to covalently capture fragment&#8208;protein interactions. Hits can be profiled to determine potency and site of crosslinking, and subsequently developed as reporters in a competitive displacement assay to identify novel hit matter. We envision that the PhABits will be widely applicable to novel protein targets, identifying starting points in the development of therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;inspired room&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;oxygen chemistry via reversible cleavage and formation of dioxygen bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical capacity. However, most currently studied Li&#8208;O  2  batteries are based on the reduction/oxidation of Li  2  O  2  and involve highly reactive superoxide and peroxide species that would cause serious degradation of cathodes, especially carbon&#8208;based materials. It is of great importance to explore lithium&#8208;oxygen reactions and find new Li&#8208;O  2  chemistry which can restrict or even avoid the negative influence of superoxide/peroxide species. Here, inspired by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxygen reduction/oxidation reactions, we introduce a copper(I) complex 3N&#8208;Cu  I  (3N=1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) to Li&#8208;O  2  batteries and successfully modulate the reaction pathway to a moderate one on reversible cleavage/formation of O&#8208;O bonds. This work demonstrates that the reaction pathways of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries could be modulated by introducing an appropriate soluble catalyst, which is another powerful choice to construct better Li&#8208;O  2  batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Radical Cation Cascade to Aryltetralin Cyclic Ether Lignans Enabled by Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The development of concise, sustainable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of aryltetralin lignans bearing a fused lactone or cyclic ether is of significant medicinal importance. We found that in the presence of Fukuzumi&#8217;s acridinium salt under blue LEDs irradiation, functionalized dicinnamyl ether derivatives are converted to aryltetralin cyclic ether lignans with concurrent generation of three stereocenters in good to high yields with up to 20:1 diastereoselectivity. Oxidation of alkene to radical cation is key to the success of this formal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of electronically mis&#8208;matched diene and dienophile. Applying this methodology, six natural products,  viz  , aglacin B, aglacin C, sulabiroin A, sulabiroin B, gaultherin C and isoshonanin, are synthesized in only 2 to 3 steps from readily available biomass&#8208;derived monolignols.

      <title>Membrane Chemistry Tunes the Structure of a Peptide Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>Membrane proteins require lipid bilayers for function. While lipid compositions reach enormous complexities, high&#8208;resolution structures are usually obtained in artificial detergents. To understand whether and how lipids guide membrane protein function, we use single&#8208;molecule FRET to probe the dynamics of DtpA, a member of the proton&#8208;coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family, in various lipid environments. We show that detergents trap DtpA in a dynamic ensemble with cytoplasmic opening. Only reconstitutions in more native environments restore cooperativity, allowing an opening to the extracellular side and a sampling of all relevant states. Bilayer compositions tune the abundance of these states. A novel state with an extreme cytoplasmic opening is accessible in bilayers with anionic head groups. Hence, chemical diversity of membranes translates into structural diversity with the current POT structures only sampling a portion of the full structural space.</dc:description>

      <title>Enabling NMR studies of high molecular weight systems without the need for deuteration: The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST experiment with delayed decoupling</title>
      <dc:description>Current biological research increasingly focusses on large human proteins and their complexes. Such proteins are difficult to study by NMR spectroscopy because they often can only be produced in higher eukaryotic expression systems, where deuteration is hardly feasible.

Here, we present the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST&#8208;[  13  C,  1  H]&#8208;HMQC experiment with much improved sensitivity for fully protonated high&#8208;molecular weight proteins. For the tested systems ranging from 100 to 240&#160;kDa in size, 3&#8208;fold higher sensitivity was obtained on average for fast relaxing signals compared to current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experiments. In the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST approach, non&#8208;observed magnetisation is optimally exploited and transverse relaxation is minimized by the newly introduced concept of delayed decoupling. The combination of high sensitivity and superior artefact suppression makes it ideal for studying inherently unstable membrane proteins or for analysing therapeutic antibodies at natural  13  C abundance. The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST and delayed decoupling will therefore expand the range of biomolecular systems accessible to NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The application of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as SERS&#8208;active platforms in multiplex volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection is still unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) serves as an ideal SERS substrate for VOCs detection. The limit of detection (LOD) of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) for toluene sensing can reach 2.5 ppm, and can be even further decreased to 0.48 ppb level when &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in between Au nanoparticles are employed onto MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) substrate, resulting in an enhancement factor of 10  10  . Additionally, we show that MIL&#8208;100(Fe) substrate has a unique &#8220;sensor array&#8221; property allowing multiplex VOCs detection, with great modifiability and expandability by doping with foreign metal elements. Finally, the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) platform is utilized to simultaneously detect   the different gaseous indicators of lung cancer with ppm detection limit, demonstrating its high potential for early diagnosis of lung cancer  in vivo   .</dc:description>

      <title>Refolding of cold denatured barstar induced by radio frequency heating &#8211; new method to study protein folding by real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The C40A/C82A double mutant of barstar has been shown to undergo cold denaturation above the water freezing point. By rapidly applying radio frequency power to lossy aqueous samples, refolding of barstar from its cold denatured state can be followed by real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. Since temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and refolding is reversible for this double mutant, multiple cycling can be utilized to obtain 2D real&#8208;time NMR data. Barstar contains two proline residues that adopt a mix of cis and trans conformations in the low temperature&#8208;unfolded state, which can potentially induce multiple folding pathways. The high time resolution real&#8208;time 2D&#8208;NMR measurements reported here show evidence for multiple folding pathways related to proline isomerization, and stable intermediates are populated. By application of advanced heating cycles and state&#8208;correlated spectroscopy, an alternative folding pathway circumventing the rate limiting cis&#8208;trans isomerization could be observed. The kinetic data revealed intermediates on both, the slow and the fast folding pathway.</dc:description>

      <title>NMR characterization of the C&#8208;mannose conformation in a thrombospondin repeat using a selective labeling approach</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the great interest in glycoproteins, structural information reporting on conformation and dynamics of the sugar moieties are limited. We present a new biochemical method to express proteins with glycans that are selectively labeled with NMR active nuclei. We report on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labeled mannose in the C&#8208;mannosylated UNC&#8208;5 thrombospondin repeat. The conformational landscape of the C&#8208;mannose sugar puckers attached to tryptophan residues of UNC&#8208;5 is characterized by interconversion between the canonical 1C4 state and the B03 / 1S3 state. This flexibility may be essential for protein folding and stabilization. We foresee that this versatile tool to produce proteins with selective labeled C&#8208;mannose can be applied and adjusted to other systems and modifications and potentially paves a way to advance glycoprotein research by unravelling the dynamical and conformational properties of glycan structures and their interactions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich LiNi  1&#8208;x&#8208;y  Mn  x  Co  y  O  2  (NMC) layered compounds have become the dominated cathode for lithium ion batteries. The role of crystallographic defects on their structure evolution and consequent performance degradation during electrochemical cycling is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the structural evolution of Ni&#8208;rich NMC cathode in a solid&#8208;state cell via in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy. We identified antiphase boundary (APB) and twin boundary (TB) separating layered phases played an important role on phase change. Upon the lithium depletion, the APB extends across the layered structure, while Li/transition metal (TM) ion mixing in the layered phases is detected to induce the rock&#8208;salt phase formation along the coherent TB. According to DFT calculations, Li/TM mixing and phase transition are aided by the low diffusion barriers of TM ions at planar defects. This work reveals the dynamical scenario of secondary phase evolution, which helps to unveil the origin of performance fading in Ni&#8208;rich NMC.</dc:description>

      <title>An Integrated Microfluidic Probe for Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Biological Samples</title>
      <dc:description>Ambient ionization based on liquid extraction is widely used in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of molecules in biological samples. The development of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) has enabled the robust imaging of tissue sections with high spatial resolution.

      <title>Direct Nanomachining on Semiconductor Wafer By Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is one of the most important instrumental methods of modern electrochemistry, due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce SECM into nanomachining by feeding the electrochemical modulations of the tip electrode back to the positioning system, and we demonstrate that SECM is qualified to be a versatile nanomachining technique on semiconductor wafers using electrochemically&#8208;induced chemical etching. The removal profile is correlated to the applied tip current when the tip is held stationary and when it is moving slowly (&lt; 20 &#181;m/s), and it follows Faraday&#8217;s law. Both regular and irregular nanopatterns can be translated into a spatially distributed current by the home&#8208;made digitally controlled SECM instrument. Thus, the desired nanopatterns can be &#8220;sculpted&#8221; directly on a semiconductor wafer by SECM direct&#8208;writing mode. The machining accuracy can be controlled to the sub&#8208;micrometer and even nanometer scales. This advance is expected to play an important role in electrochemical nanomachining for 3D micro/nano&#8208;structures in the semiconductor industry.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is typically reliant on the local concentration and diffusion of oxygen. Due to the hypoxic microenvironment found in solid tumors, oxygen&#8208;independent photosensitizers are in great demand for cancer therapy. We herein report an iridium(III) anthraquinone complex (Ir4) as a mitochondrion&#8208;localized carbon radical initiator.

Furthermore, the two&#8208;photon excitation properties of Ir4 (&#955;ex = 730 nm) are highly desirable for imaging. Upon irradiation, the reduced form of Ir4 (Ir4&#8208;red) generates carbon radicals leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death (IC50light = 2.1 &#956;M, IC50dark = 58.2 &#956;M, PI = 27.7). The efficacy of Ir4 as a PDT agent was also demonstrated under hypoxic conditions in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ir4 is the first metal complex&#8208;based theranostic agent which can generate carbon radicals for oxygen&#8208;independent two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>High Throughput Label&#8208;Free Enzymatic Assays using Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>High throughput (HT) enzymatic assays, which typically rely on labeled compounds and plate readers, are important for drug discovery. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides an alternative method of performing HT label&#8208;free assays. Here we demonstrate the use of a HT platform based on desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS for the label&#8208;free study of enzymatic reactions directly from the bioassay matrix, with an effective analysis time of 0.3 s/sample. This system allows for thorough analysis of the enzymatic process through monitoring of its substrate and product after an external calibration. We show the platform capabilities by an in&#8208;depth study of the acetylcholinesterase assay, including kinetic parameter determination, rapid inhibitor screening and further characterization of positive hits (i.e. IC  50  , K  i  ), as well as inhibition&#8208;reactivation assays. We anticipate that this platform will have high impact in label&#8208;free enzymology as well as in drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying the Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus</title>
      <dc:description>A straightforward quantification method to consistently determine the overall functionalization degree of covalently modified two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) by Raman spectroscopy has been carried out. Indeed, the successful reductive methylation of the BP lattice using sodium intercalation compounds and exhibiting different functionalization degrees has been demonstrated by  31  P&#8208;magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the correlation of  31  P&#8208;MAS NMR spectroscopy and statistical Raman spectroscopy (SRS) revealed the first method to determine the functionalization degree of BP solely by evaluating the intensities of distinct peaks in the Raman spectra of the covalently modified material, in a similar way to the widely employed I  D  /I  G  ratio of graphene research.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible Hydride Migration from C5Me5 to Rh(I) revealed by a Cooperative Bimetallic Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The use of cyclopentadienyl ligands in organometallic chemistry and catalysis is ubiquitous, mostly due to their robust spectator role. Nonetheless, increasing examples of non&#8208;innocent behaviour are being documented.

Experimental proof was acquired from bimetallic rhodium/gold structures in which the gold centre binds either to the rhodium atom or to the activated Cp* ring. Reversibility of the C&#8212;H activation event regenerates the Rh(I) and Au(I) monometallic precursors, whose cooperative reactivity towards polar E&#8212;H bonds (E = O, N), including the N&#8212;H bonds in ammonia, can be understood in terms of bimetallic frustration.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis Elucidates the Key Antigenic Epitope of the Autism&#8208;related Bacterium Clostridium bolteae Capsular Octadecasaccharide</title>
      <dc:description>The gut pathogen  Clostridium bolteae  has been associated with the onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To create vaccines against  C. bolteae  , it is important to identify exact protective epitopes of the immunologically active capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Here, we prepared a series of  C. bolteae  CPS glycans up to an octadecasaccharide. Key to achieving the total syntheses is a [2+2] coupling strategy based on a &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Man  p  repeating unit that in turn was accessed via a stereoselective &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;rhamnosylation. The 4,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylidene&#8208;induced conformational locking is a powerful strategy for forming &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycoside.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The gut pathogen  Clostridium bolteae  has been associated with the onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To create vaccines against  C. bolteae  , it is important to identify exact protective epitopes of the immunologically active capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Here, we prepared a series of  C. bolteae  CPS glycans up to an octadecasaccharide. Key to achieving the total syntheses is a [2+2] coupling strategy based on a &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Man  p  repeating unit that in turn was accessed via a stereoselective &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;rhamnosylation. The 4,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylidene&#8208;induced conformational locking is a powerful strategy for forming &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycoside. An indirect strategy based on the C2 epimerization of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;quinovoside was efficiently achieved by Swern oxidation and borohydride reduction.

      <title>Quantification of the Magnetic Anisotropy of a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet from the Experimental Electron Density</title>
      <dc:description>We report an entirely new application of the experimental electron density (EED) in the study of magnetic anisotropy of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Among those SMMs based on one single transition metal, tetrahedral Co(II)&#8208;complexes are prominent, and their large zero&#8208;field splitting arises exclusively from coupling between the dx2&#8208;y2 and dxy orbitals. Using very low temperature single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we obtained an accurate electron density (ED) for a prototypical SMM, and we have used the experimental d&#8208;orbital populations to quantify the dxy&#8208;dx2&#8208;y2 coupling, which simultaneously provides us with the composition of the ground state Kramers doublet wave function. Based on this experimentally determined wave function, we calculate an energy barrier for magnetic relaxation in the range 193&#8208;268 cm&#8208;1, which is in full accordance with the previously published value of 230 cm&#8208;1 obtained from near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy.

      <title>On the Promotion of Catalytic Reactions by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <dc:description>Surface acoustic waves (SAW) allow to manipulate surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, sensor and nanotechnology. SAWs were shown to cause a strong increase in catalytic activity and selectivity in many oxidation and decomposition reactions on metallic and oxidic catalysts. However, the promotion mechanism has not been unambiguously identified. Using stroboscopic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectro&#8208;microscopy we were able to evidence a sub&#8208;nanosecond work function change during propagation of 500 MHz SAWs on a 9 nm thick platinum film.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surface acoustic waves (SAW) allow to manipulate surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, sensor and nanotechnology. SAWs were shown to cause a strong increase in catalytic activity and selectivity in many oxidation and decomposition reactions on metallic and oxidic catalysts. However, the promotion mechanism has not been unambiguously identified. Using stroboscopic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectro&#8208;microscopy we were able to evidence a sub&#8208;nanosecond work function change during propagation of 500 MHz SAWs on a 9 nm thick platinum film. We quantify the work function change to 455 &#181;eV. Such a small variation rules out that electronic effects due to elastic deformation (strain) play a major role in the SAW&#8208;induced promotion of catalysis. In a second set of experiments SAW&#8208;induced intermixing of a five monolayers thick Rh film on top of polycrystalline platinum was demonstrated to be due to enhanced thermal diffusion caused by an increase of the surface temperature by about 75 K when SAWs were excited.

      <dc:description>Radiation&#8208;cleavage chemistry that can achieve tumor&#8208;selective prodrug activation without causing unwanted side effects is of high value for clinical use yet has not been established. Here, we describe 3,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzyl carbamate (DHBC) as a masking group that can be selectively and efficiently removed by external radiation  in vitro  and  in vivo  . DHBC reacts mainly with hydroxyl radical among reactive oxygen species produced by radiation to afford hydroxylation on para/ortho positions, followed by 1,4&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;elimination to rescue the diverse functionality of the client molecule. We found that the reaction is rapid and can liberate client functional molecules under physiological conditions. This controlled release platform is compatible with living organisms, as demonstrated by the release of a rhodol fluorophore derivative (O&#8208;methylrhodol,  MeRho  ) in three cancer cell lines and mouse tumor xenografts. The combined benefits of synthetic ease, rapid kinetics, independence of penetration depth, high release yields, and structural compactness make DHBC derivatives attractive chemical caging moieties for use in radiation&#8208;perturbing chemical biology and prodrug activation  in vivo.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamics of Bacteriorhodopsin in the Dark&#8208;Adapted State from Solution NMR</title>
      <dc:description>To achieve efficient proton pumping in the light&#8208;driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, the protein must be tightly coupled to the retinal to rapidly convert retinal isomerization into protein structural rearrangements. Methyl group dynamics of bR embedded in lipid nanodiscs were determined in the dark&#8208;adapted state, and were found to be mostly well&#8208;ordered at the cytosolic side. Methyl groups in the M145A mutant of bR, which displays only 10% residual proton pumping activity, are less well ordered suggesting a link between side chain dynamics on the cytosolic side of the bR cavity and proton pumping activity. In addition, slow conformational exchange, attributed to low frequency motions of aromatic rings, was indirectly observed for residues on the extracellular side of the bR cavity. This may be related to reorganization of the water network. These observations provide a detailed picture of previously undescribed equilibrium dynamics on different time scales for ground&#8208;state bR.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Function HKUST&#8208;1 Templating and Catalyzing Formation of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots at Mild Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g&#8208;CNQDs) are highly promising photoresponsive materials. However, synthesis of monodispersed g&#8208;CNQDs remains challenging. Here we report the dual function of MOF [Cu3BTC2] (HKUST&#8208;1) as a catalyst and template simultaneously to prepare g&#8208;CNQDs at mild conditions. Cyanamide (CA), a graphitic carbon nitride precursor, catalytically dimerized inside the MOF larger cavities at 90 oC and condensed into g&#8208;CNQDs at 120 oC in a controlled fashion. The HKUST&#8208;1 template was stable at the reaction conditions leading to uniform g&#8208;CNQDs with particle size of 2.22 &#177; 0.68 nm. The as prepared g&#8208;CNQDs showed photoluminescence emission with 3.1% quantum yield. Depending on this concept (MOF dual functionality) for catalyzing CA polycondensation (open metal sites (OMSs) effect) and controlling the produced particle size (pore templating effect) in addition to MOF tunable porosity, it is expected to produce unique g&#8208;CNQDs with controllable size, morphology, and surface functionality.</dc:description>

However, their direct use in the formation of C&#8208;C bonds is less established. Although remarkable advances in the coupling of aryl&#173;lithium compounds have been achieved, Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  coupling reactions are very limited. Here, we report the first general protocol for the coupling or aryl chlorides with alkyllithium reagents. Palladium catalysts based on  y  lide&#8208;substituted  phos  phines (YPhos) were found to be excellently suited for this transformation giving high selectivities at room temperature with a variety of aryl chlorides without the need for an additional transmetallation reagent. This is demonstrated in gram&#8208;scale synthesis including building blocks for materials chemistry and pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the direct coupling of aryllithiums as well as Grignard reagents with aryl chlorides was also easily accomplished at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Seed Induced Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Stereoselective and temporally controlled supramolecular polymerizations are ubiquitous in nature and is a desirable attribute to the design of chiral, well&#8208;defined functional materials. Kinetically controlled, living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) has emerged recently to synthesize supramolecular polymers with controlled length and narrow dispersity. On the other hand, stringent design requirements for chiral discriminating monomers precludes the stereoselective control of the supramolecular polymer&#8217;s structure. Herein we report a synergetic stereo and structural control of supramolecular polymerization by the realization of an unprecedented stereoselective seed induced LSP. Homochiral and seeded growth is demonstrated with bischromophoric naphthalene diimide (NDI) enantiomers with chiral binaphthyl amine core, exhibiting strong self&#8208;recognition abilities and pathway complexity.</dc:description>

      <title>Accelerating Electrochemical Reactions in a Voltage&#8208;Controlled Interfacial Microreactor</title>
      <dc:description>Microdroplet chemistry is attracting increasing attention for accelerated reactions at the air/solution interface. We report here a novel voltage&#8208;controlled interfacial microreactor allowing acceleration of electrochemical reactions which are not observed in bulk or conventional electrochemical cells. The microreactor is formed at the interface of the Taylor cone in an electrospray emitter with a large orifice. This allows continuous contact of the electrode and the reactants at/near the interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, electro&#8208;oxidative C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H coupling and electro&#8208;oxidation of benzyl alcohol were shown to be accelerated by more than an order of magnitude compared to the corresponding bulk reactions. The new electrochemical microreactor has unique features that allow i) voltage&#8208;controlled acceleration of electrochemical reactions achieved by voltage&#8208;dependent formation of the interfacial microreactor; ii) &#8220;reversible&#8221; electrochemical derivatization; and iii)  in situ  mechanistic study and capture of key radical intermediates when coupled with mass spectrometry.</dc:description>
