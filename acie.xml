         <title>Decorating Channel Walls in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Crown Ethers for Efficient and Selective Separation of Radioactive Strontium(II)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear accidents and the improper disposal of nuclear wastes have&#160;led&#160;to serious environmental pollution. The rational design of adsorbents for the highly efficient separation of strontium(II) is essential in treating nuclear waste and recovering radioactive strontium resources. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential materials for the separation of aqueous metal ions owing to their designable structure and tunable functionality. Herein, a novel 3D MOF&#160;material&#160;MOF&#8208;18Cr6, in which 1D channels were formed using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether&#8208;containing ligands as channel walls, was fabricated for strontium(II) separation. In contrast to traditional MOFs designed by grafting functional groups in the framework pores, MOF&#8208;18Cr6 possesses regular 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether cavities on the channel walls, which not only can transport and intake strontium(II)&#160;&#160;via the channels, but also prevent blockage of the channels after the binding of strontium(II). Consequently, the functional sites were fully utilized to achieve&#160;a&#160;high strontium(II) removal&#160;rate&#160;of 99.73% in simulated nuclear wastewater. This study fabricates a highly promising adsorbent for the separation of aqueous radioactive strontium(II), and more importantly, can provide a new strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF adsorbents for separating target substances from complex aqueous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area of 945 m2 g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6M HCl), base (6M NaOH), and boiling water over 24 hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 85 &#176;C, 95% of relative humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enabled Full&#8208;color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are doped into the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (L or D) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves a convenient way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization method reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. The work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen bond network of chiral DES transfer their chirality to the achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in DES.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective High&#8208;Throughput Assay Showcased for the Identification of (R)&#8208; as well as (S)&#8208;Selective Unspecific Peroxygenases for C&#8208;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Here, a high&#8208;throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported giving information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity showcased for peroxygenase catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on analyzing spectrophotometrically the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec&#8208;alcohol product during the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non&#8208;described wild&#8208;type UPOs displaying (S)&#8208; as well as (R)&#8208;stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified reaching up to 98% ee for the (R)&#8208; and 94% ee for the (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason of the observed complementary stereopreference.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on Au (111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been prepared on Au (111) and their thermal stability, adsorption geometry, and molecular order were characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strong &#963;&#8208;bond character of NHO anchoring to Au induced high geometrical flexibility that enabled a flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry via coordination to Au&#8208;adatom. The flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry was utilized to further increase the surface interaction of NHO monolayer by backbone functionalization with methyl groups that induced high thermal stability and a large impact on work function values, which outperformed that of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. STM measurements, supported by DFT modeling, identified that NHOs were self&#8208;assembled in dimers, trimers, and tetramers constructed of two, three, and four complexes of NHO&#8208;Au&#8208;adatom. This self&#8208;assembly pattern was correlated to strong NHO&#8208;Au interactions and steric hindrance between adsorbates, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of In&#8208;Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn2+ diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in&#8208;situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de&#8208;solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra&#8208;high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209 hours at 20 mA cm&#8208;2, 20 mAh cm&#8208;2 and 40 mA cm&#8208;2, 20 mAh cm&#8208;2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in-situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de-solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra-high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209 hours at 20 mA cm-2, 20 mAh cm-2 and 40 mA cm-2, 20 mAh cm-2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Forcing Twisted 1,7&#8208;Dibromoperylene Diimides to Flatten in the Solid State: What a Difference an Atom Makes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208;diimides (PDI) are workhorses in the field of organic electronics, owing to their appealing n&#8208;semiconducting properties. Optimization of their performances is widely pursued by bay&#8208;atom substitution and diverse imide functionalization. Bulk solids and thin&#8208;films of these species crystallize in a variety of stacking configurations, depending on the geometry of the stable conformation of the polyaromatic core. We here demonstrate that 1,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;substituted perylene&#8208;diimides, PDI(H2Br2), possessing a heavily twisted conformation in the gas phase, in solution and in the solids, can be easily flattened in the solid state into centrosymmetric molecules if the polyaromatic cores form p&#8208;p stabilized chains. This is achieved by using axial residues with low stereochemical hindrance, as guaranteed by a single CH2/NH spacer directly linked to the imide function. Structural powder diffraction and DFT calculations on four newly designed species of the PDI(H2Br2) class coherently show that, thanks to the flexibility of the N&#8208;X&#8208;Ar link (X = CH2/NH), flat cores are indeed obtained by overcoming the interconversion barrier between twisted atropoisomers, of only 26.5 kJ mol&#8208;1. This strategy may then be useful to induce &#8220;anomalously flat&#8221; polyaromatic cores of different kinds (substituted acenes/rylenes) in the solid state, towards suitable crystal packing and orbital interactions for improved electronic performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study uses a rapid tandem mass spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8208;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001% (10 ppm) to 99%, with better than 10% RSD, along with short (1 min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#181;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, e.g. deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, e.g. organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>A Negatively Curved &#960;&#8208;Expanded Pyracylene Comprising a Tropylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose &#960;&#8208;expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising 7&#8208;membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic properties. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallography the complete cyclization leads to a boat&#8208;shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7&#8208;membered ring. The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized tropylium cation, showing bathochromically shifted absorption bands reaching into the near&#8208;infrared region beyond 1000 nm. The altered structural features supported by theoretical calculations point towards aromatic character of the positively charged 7&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8208;251 &#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tg) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8208;20 &#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8208;0.89 MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1 MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of chiral superstructures through self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the&#160;interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made the first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers.&#160;After chiral induction, the reversible [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of cinnamate group in polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking.&#160;Based on this&#160;photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy,&#160;a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of&#160;chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Nanostructures: Self&#8208;adjuvant carriers for Highly Efficient Subunit Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subunit vaccines based on antigen proteins or epitopes of pathogens or tumors show advantages in immunological precision and high safety, but are often limited by their low immunogenicity. Adjuvants can boost immune responses by stimulating immune cells or promoting antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), yet existing clinical adjuvants struggle in simultaneously achieving these dual functions. Additionally, the spatial organization of antigens might be crucial to their immunogenicity. Hence, superior adjuvants should potently stimulate the immune system, precisely arrange antigens, and effectively deliver antigens to APCs. Recently, precisely organizing and delivering antigens with the unique editability of DNA nanostructures have been proposed, presenting unique abilities in significantly improved the immunogenicity of antigens. In this minireview, we will discuss the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in this field. The potential and challenges associated with self&#8208;adjuvant DNA nanostructures would also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Stereocontrolled Degradable Polymer by Living Cascade Enyne Metathesis

Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. Highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers were prepared using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkoxyallenes and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The resulting chiral polymer exhibited a narrow dispersity window. Block copolymers were prepared not only by sequentially adding nondegradable and degradable monomers but also by using enantiomerically different monomers to produce stereocontrolled blocks. Owing to the hydrolyzable N,O&#8208;acetal moiety in the backbone structure, the resulting polymer could degrade under acidic conditions generated using various acid concentrations to control the degradation. Additionally, the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction modified the polymer without losing the stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite is capable of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene, respectively. The process requires lower temperature as compared to methane hydroxylation, which is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Produced olefins form highly stable complexes with copper(I) sites, realizing a product protection strategy and enabling high selectivity.







Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8722;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95&#8201;% for ethane and above 85&#8201;% for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group Metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recently explored porous and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) with few&#8208;atomic thicknesses via various synthetic techniques. It also highlights their unique structural benefits, particularly for manipulating the intrinsic electronic structure in high&#8208;performance electrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.

         <dc:description>
Two dimeric acceptors, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized by linking two Y6&#8208;derivative segments using different central linking bridges: selenophene and thiophene. Both adopt a favorable O&#8208;shape conformation as confirmed by simulations and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Paired with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer donor PM6, optimized solar cells employing DIBP3F&#8208;Se showcase remarkable performance with a power conversion efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, as demonstrated by Donghong Yu, Thomas&#8197;D. Anthopoulos, Ergang Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302888).

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.







Abstract
One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;directed strategy was developed to control the shapes of carbon nanoparticles (CNs) from spheres to rods with various aspect ratios (ARs). This shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self&#8208;assembly followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods.







Abstract
Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. Based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

This shape-control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self-assembly followed by carbonization.

         <title>Cover Picture: Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of synthetic full&#8208;length Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared to investigate the impact of Ser phosphorylation, as reported by Ariel Afek, Muhammad Jbara et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310913). Comprehensive DNA binding analysis and high&#8208;throughput screening revealed that the phosphorylation pattern plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but does not affect sequence specificity. The insights gained into the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation shed light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation to Formate over Edge&#8208;Sulfur Vacancies of Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation to formate is an attractive route for the utilization of this greenhouse gas. In their Research Article (e202307086), Dehui Deng, Liang Yu, and co&#8208;workers report edge&#8208;rich molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a low&#8208;cost catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate with superior activity, selectivity, and high stability. Comprehensive mechanism studies reveal that selective production of formate is enabled at MoS2 edge sulfur vacancies via a new water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst based on a tubular photosensitive carbon nitride (CN) and a conductive zinc&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)) catalytic unit is fabricated for H2O2 photosynthesis. The annealing&#8208;induced shrinkage of the Zn&#8208;O4 moiety in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) unlocks its capability for O2 reduction to H2O2, and meanwhile, the strong interaction between these two components facilitates the photoelectron injection from CN to the activated Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in &#176;C), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8722; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient property and electron&#8208;rich property of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1 exhibited excellent activities for CO2 photoreduction, higher than VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron&#8208;deficient unit, electron&#8208;rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.







Abstract
The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA=pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.

As expected, the as-prepared vinylene-linked sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-conjugated metal-covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL-MCOF-1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL-MCOF-2 and g-C&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi-electronic metal clusters (Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PyCA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (PyCA=pyrazolate-4-carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo-induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron-density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters-based COFs to effective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Terminal C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction Inside Water Soluble Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for light&#8208;activated Glaser coupling in water is reported that uses visible light to trigger host&#8208;guest photoredox chemistry. Cage&#8208;confined neutral radicals drive the C&#8722;C coupling step through substrate preorganization.







Abstract
Developing methods that activate C&#8722;H bonds directly with high selectivity for C&#8722;C bond formation in complex organic synthesis has been a major chemistry challenge. Recently it has been shown that photoactivation of weakly polarized C&#8722;H bonds can be carried out inside a cationic water&#8208;soluble nanocage with visible light&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) chemistry. Using this novel photoredox activation paradigm, here we demonstrate C&#8722;C bond formation to photo&#8208;generate 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature in water from terminal aromatic alkynes for the first time. The formation of cavity&#8208;confined alkyne radical cation and the proton&#8208;removed neutral radical species highlight the unique C&#8722;C coupling step driven by supramolecular preorganization.

         <title>Cover Picture: Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ &#8208; A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#160;is a so&#8208;far still rather underestimated visible emitter that is more abundant than the currently dominantly used emitter Eu2+. This could be a possible alternative for future LED phosphors. The cover picture shows octahedrally coordinated Mn2+&#160;ions embedded in the borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]. Borosulfates are weakly coordinating ligands, which is directly reflected in the photoluminescence properties of the Mn2+ ions: They show orange narrow emission, which is indicative for a weak octahedral ligand field, as explained by J&#246;rn Bruns, Markus Suta et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309212).

         <title>Inside Cover: Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles are reported by Jian Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307096). The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties for small aliphatic and large aromatic substrates in catalytic semihydrogenation reactions. Calculations provide insights into the nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co&#8208;polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Biocatalysts from Specialized Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable (bio)catalysts that complement existing synthetic methods. However, the range of biotransformations used in the laboratory is limited. Here we give an overview on the biosynthesis&#8208;inspired discovery of novel biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges. Prominent examples from this dynamic field highlight remarkable enzymes for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free amide formation and modification, control of pericyclic reactions, achieve stereoselective hetero&#8208; and polycyclizations, enable atroposelective aryl couplings, facilitate site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H activations, introduce ring strain, and promote N&#8208;N bond formations. We also explore unusual functions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, radical SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes, flavoproteins, and enzymes recruited from primary metabolism, which offer opportunities for synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, directed evolution, and catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Conception and evaluation of a library of cleavable mass tags for digital polymers sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of phosphoramidite macromonomers containing a main&#8208;chain cleavable alkoxyamine and a side&#8208;chain substituent of variable molar mass (i.e. mass tag) was prepared in this work. These monomers can be used in automated solid&#8208;phase phosphoramidite chemistry and therefore incorporated periodically inside digitally&#8208;encoded poly(phosphodiester) chains. Consequently, the formed polymers contain tagged cleavable sites that guide their fragmentation in mass spectrometry sequencing and enhance their digital readability. The macromonomers were all prepared via a seven steps synthetic procedure. They were afterwards tested for the synthesis and sequencing of model digital polymers. Uniform digitally&#8208;encoded polymers were obtained as major species in all cases, even though some minor defects were sometimes detected. Furthermore, the polymers were decoded in pseudo&#8208;MS3 conditions, thus confirming the reliability and versatility of the macromonomers library.</dc:description>

         <title>High density polyethylene with in&#8208;chain photolyzable and hydrolyzable groups enabling recycling and degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylenes endowed with low densities of in&#8208;chain hydrolyzable and photocleavable groups can improve their circularity and potentially reduce their environmental persistency. We show with model polymers derived from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that the simultaneous presence of both groups has no adverse effect on the polyethylene crystal structure and thermal properties. Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of keto&#8208;polyethylenes from non&#8208;alternating catalytic ethylene&#8208;CO chain growth copolymerization yield high molecular weight in&#8208;chain keto&#8208;ester polyethylenes (Mn ~50.000 g mol&#8208;1). Oxidation can proceed without chain scission and consequently the desirable materials properties of HDPE are retained. At the same time we demonstrate the suitability of the in&#8208;chain ester groups for chemical recycling by methanolysis, and show that photolytic degradation by extended exposure to simulated sunlight occurs via the keto groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclization in Eunicellane Derived Diterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC&#8208;like enzymes are known but are very rare. Here, we genome&#8208;mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named ari, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain Amycolatopsis arida. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), that possess a&#160;6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a non&#8208;canonical two&#8208;step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic cis&#8208;eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold via C2&#8208;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring&#8208;closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF&#8208;mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80 &#176;C, 1 bar H2. The key to the success of&#160;this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester&#160;into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8208;Fe5C2&#8208;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but still being challenging. The electronic property of catalyst is essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Here, a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic property of the ternary ZnOx&#8208;Fe5C2&#8208;Fe3O4, in which the electron transfer pathway (ZnOx &#8594; Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8208;CO* on catalytic interface, facilitating the C&#8208;C coupling between &#8208;CHx* and &#8208;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron transfer buffering effect, extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6 gEtOH kgcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (with CO of 10 vol% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one-dimensional (1D), ribbon-like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;-conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis-peri-dinaphtho-rylene molecules, wherein the peri-positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho-units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X-ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure-dependent electronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; = 460 &#177; 15 nm; 80 mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#183; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#183;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590 &#181;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding   the Role of Fluorine Groups  in Passivating Defects  for Perovskite Solar Cells &#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing fluorine (F) groups into a passivator plays an important role in enhancing the defect passivation effect for the perovskite film, which is usually attributed to the direct interaction of F and defect states. However, the interaction between electronegative F and electron&#8208;rich passivation groups in the same molecule, which may influence the passivation effect, is ignored. We herein report that such interactions can vary the electron cloud distribution around the passivation groups and thus changing their coordination with defect sites. By comparing two fluorinated molecules, heptafluorobutylamine (HFBM) and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), we find that the F/&#8211;NH2 interaction in HFBM is stronger than the F/&#8211;COOH one in HFBA, inducing weaker passivation ability of HFBM than HFBA. Accordingly, HFBA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide an efficiency of 24.70% with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0 cm2) based on HFBA reaches 21.13%. Our work offers an insight into understanding an unaware role of the F group in impacting the passivation effect for the perovskite film.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n = 1&#8208;5; HA = hexylamine and MA = methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n = &#8734;, Tc = 239 K) to n = 2 (Tc = 310 K, &#916;T = 71 K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps~1.5 &#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent ~19.74 &#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177; 60V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non&#8208;volatile memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds. Their aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au dimers with &#960;&#8208;stacking or one&#8208;dimensional extended Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au chains. Via drop&#8208;casting method, supramolecular P&#8208; or M&#8208;helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 0.030, &#934;FL = 67%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10&#8208;3. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8210;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8210; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2 &#177; 1 &#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3 &#177; 1.9 pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1b in BLM demonstrated the permeability ratio of PCl&#8210;/PK+ = 0.053 &#177;0.02, PClO4&#8210;/PCl&#8210; = 2.1 &#177; 0.5, and PK+/PNa+ = 1.5 &#177; 1, respectively, indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Enhanced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Polymer Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have important applications for biological imaging, oxygen sensing, data encryption, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the many advantages polymeric materials offer such as great control over gas permeability and processing flexibility, disorder is traditionally considered as an intrinsic negative impact on the efficiency for embedded RTP luminophores, as various allowed thermal motions could quench the emitting states. However, we propose that such disorder&#8208;enabled freedoms of microscopic motions can be beneficial for charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated RTP, which is facilitated by molecular conformational changes among different electronic transition states. Using the &#8220;classic&#8221; pyrene&#8208;aniline excimer as an example, we demonstrate the mutual enhancement of red/near&#8208;infrared and green RTP emissions from the pyrene and aniline moieties, respectively, upon doping of the aniline polymer with trace pyrene derivatives. In comparison, a pyrene&#8208;doped crystal formed with the same aniline structure exhibits only charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence with no red or green RTP observed, suggesting that order suppresses the RTP channels. The proposed polymerization strategy may be used as a unified method to generate multi&#8208;emissive polymeric RTP materials from a vast pool of known and unknown exciplexes and charge&#8208;transfer complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts. Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisostereres of tert&#8208;butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench&#8208;stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.







Abstract
Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8208;cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site catalyst comprised of ferric iron confined in an MFI&#8208;type zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method involving rapid mixing at high temperature. The isolated Fe species in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and resistant to coking.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for industrial preparation of propene that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, ferric catalyst confined in a zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95&#8201;% propene selectivity and over 99&#8201;% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and coke free, with a deactivation constant of 0.01&#8197;h&#8722;1. This study provided guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early transition metals.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyvinyl chloride and the conjugated polymer PM6 were discovered, resulting in excellent mechanical properties in PM6/polyvinyl chloride thin films and high thermal/bending stability in organic solar cells.







Abstract
The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we have added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) into the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between these two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibit a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35&#8201;%, compared to 10.12&#8201;% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis reveal that a &#8220;cyclohexyl&#8208;like&#8221; structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films have demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Poor Acridones and Acridiniums as Super Photooxidants in Molecular Photoelectrochemistry by Unusual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoelectrochemical conditions, dicyanated acridones are precatalysts for acridinium ions as closed&#8208;shell, highly potent arene photooxidants. Despite the lifetime permitting diffusion&#8208;controlled quenching, a preassembly with substrate nonetheless operates. Highlighting the profound influence of preassembly on photocatalysis, quenching diverts from single to double electron transfer reduction of the excited state to an acridinide anion.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient acridones and in situ generated acridinium salts are reported as potent, closed&#8208;shell photooxidants that undergo surprising mechanisms. When bridging acyclic triarylamine catalysts with a carbonyl group (acridones), this completely diverts their behavior away from open&#8208;shell, radical cationic, &#8216;beyond diffusion&#8217; photocatalysis to closed&#8208;shell, neutral, diffusion&#8208;controlled photocatalysis. Br&#248;nsted acid activation of acridones dramatically increases excited state oxidation power (by +0.8&#8197;V). Upon reduction of protonated acridones, they transform to electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts as even more potent photooxidants (*E1/2=+2.56&#8211;3.05&#8197;V vs SCE). These oxidize even electron&#8208;deficient arenes where conventional acridinium salt photooxidants have thusfar been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Surprisingly, upon photoexcitation these electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts appear to undergo two electron reductive quenching to form acridinide anions, spectroscopically&#8208;detected as their protonated forms. This new behaviour is partly enabled by a catalyst preassembly with the arene, and contrasts to conventional SET reductive quenching of acridinium salts. Critically, this study illustrates how redox active chromophoric molecules initially considered photocatalysts can transform during the reaction to catalytically active species with completely different redox and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb1.04&#8208;RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.







Abstract
CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR.

&lt;p&gt;The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.04&lt;/sub&gt;-RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru-based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO-resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggests that Pb acts as oxygen-rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.04&lt;/sub&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru-based catalyst with high activity and strong CO-resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithienoazepine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes: Janus&#8208;Faced Effects of a Thiophene&#8208;Fused Structure on Antiaromatic Azepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine was employed as a key core of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The Janus&#8208;faced effect of the thiophene&#8208;fused structure, which enhances the antiaromaticity of the azepine ring and, at the same time, relive the antiaromaticity through the deformation from the aromatic thiophene ring to the quinoidal thienyl moiety, is effective to attain the largely red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878&#8197;nm in solution.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Sm3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Sm3+ at room temperature. This promising system opens powerful horizons for new upconverting material using co&#8208;crystal assemblies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage has been shown to catalyze the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between C60 and anthracene in water to yield mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;adducts with high regioselectivity. Catalytic amounts of the cage led to better conversions because it favours co&#8208;encapsulation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. Moreover, the larger binding affinity of the cage for C60 compared to the resulting adducts enables catalytic turnover.







Abstract
Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of SubPc cage dissolved in water promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the resulting C60 cycloadduct facilitates its displacement by pristine C60, which grants catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic process of Zn2+ dehydration when migrating into the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coated on a Zn anode is unraveled. General optimization strategies are proposed by fine&#8208;tuning the MOF surface with hydrophilic groups to lower the dehydration energy by &#8776;1&#8197;eV and by reducing the effective coating thickness to only &#8776;16&#8197;nm, paving a way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities.







Abstract
Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8722;OH or &#8722;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1&#8197;eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.

         <title>Minimalist Design of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes: Tunable Geometry, Size, Chirality, and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist design of robust DNA nanotubes from only 4 DNA strands, with tunable geometry, chirality, length, and assembly dynamics is reported. The method leads to robust nanotubes under physiologically relevant conditions, as cost&#8208;efficient nanomaterial templates or drug&#8208;delivery vehicles.







Abstract
DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross&#8208;sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h&#8208;motif structure incorporating double&#8208;crossover (DX) tile&#8208;like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self&#8208;assembly of h&#8208;motif&#8208;based DNA nanotube (H&#8208;NT) units, thus producing programmable, micrometer&#8208;long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the H&#8208;NT nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist H&#8208;NTs can assemble at near&#8208;physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA&#8208;economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonics, or other functional materials and as cost&#8208;efficient drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.

         <title>Inside Cover: Synthesis of Levulinic Acids From Muconic Acids in Hot Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple heating of muconic acid in water at high temperature in an autoclave under autogenic pressure provides levulinic acid in high yield, as described by Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202309597). The method can also be applied to make substituted levulinic acids from the corresponding muconic acids. Lignin oil rich in propylguaiacol obtained from pine sawdust has been successfully transformed into 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid.

         <title>A Deeper Understanding of Metal Nucleation and Growth in Rechargeable Metal Batteries Through Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium and sodium metal batteries continue to occupy the forefront of battery research. Their exceptionally high energy density and nominal voltages are highly attractive for cutting&#8208;edge energy storage applications. Anode&#8208;free metal batteries are also coming into the research spotlight offering improved safety and even higher energy densities than conventional metal batteries. However, uneven metal nucleation and growth which leads to dendrites continues to limit the commercialisation of conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries alike. This review connects models and theories from well&#8208;established fields in metallurgy and electrodeposition to both conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries. These highly applicable models and theories explain the driving forces of uneven metal growth and can inform future experiment design. Finally, the models and theories that are most relevant to each anode&#8208;related cell component are identified. Keeping these specific models and theories in mind will assist with rational design for these components.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel(II) Analogues of Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Picosecond Excited&#8208;State Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Square&#8208;planar Ni(II) complexes are interesting as cheaper and more sustainable alternatives to Pt(II) luminophores widely used in lighting and photocatalysis. We investigated the excited&#8208;state behavior of two Ni(II) complexes, which are isostructural with two luminescent Pt(II) complexes. The initially excited singlet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) excited states in the Ni(II) complexes decay to metal&#8208;centered (3MC) excited states within less than 1 picosecond, followed by non&#8208;radiative relaxation of the 3MC states to the electronic ground state within 9 &#8208; 21 ps. This contrasts with the population of an emissive triplet ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) excited state upon excitation of the Pt(II) analogues. Structural distortions of the Ni(II) complexes are responsible for this discrepant behavior and lead to dark 3MC states far lower in energy than the luminescent 3LC states of Pt(II) compounds. Our findings suggest that if these structural distortions could be restricted by more rigid coordination environments and stronger ligand fields, the excited&#8208;state relaxation in four&#8208;coordinate Ni(II) complexes could be decelerated such that luminescent 3LC or 3MLCT excited states become accessible. These insights are relevant to make Ni(II) fit for photophysical and photochemical applications that relied on Pt(II) until now.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modifications Produce Two&#8208;Step Magnetic Switching in a Cobalt(dioxolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mononuclear monodioxolene valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complexes typically exist in their low spin (l.s.) CoIII(cat2&#8210;) and high spin (h.s.) CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) forms (cat2&#8210; = catecholato, and sq&#8226;&#8210; = seminquinonato forms of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolene), which reversibly interconvert via temperature&#8208;dependent intramolecular electron transfer. Typically, the remaining four coordination sites on cobalt are supported by a tetradentate ligand whose properties influence the temperature at which VT occurs. We report that replacing one chelating pyridyl arm of tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (tpa) with a weaker field ortho&#8208;anisole moiety facilitates access to a third magnetic state, and examine a series of related complexes. Variable temperature crystallographic, magnetic, calorimetric, and spectroscopic studies support that this third state is consistent with l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;). Thus, our ligand modifications not only provide access to the VT transition from l.s. CoIII(cat2&#8210;) to l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;), but at higher temperatures, the complex undergoes spin crossover from l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) to h.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;), representing the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. We hypothesize that ligand dynamicity may facilitate access to the rarely observed l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) intermediate state, suggesting a new design criterion in the development of stimulus&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;state molecular switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide bandgap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) nanocrystals and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Al2O3. The PL properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect mediated states leading to efficient narrow deep blue emission at 400 nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield approaching 50% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retainining 80% of the initial fluorescence intensity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Formation of&#160;borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8211;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of triarylboranes bearing an&#160;ortho&#8208;phosphino substituent (ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes). The borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives were fully characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses.&#160;These dearomatized products were demonstrated to undergo the reverse reaction in the dark at room temperature, realizing photochemical and thermal interconversion between triarylboranes and boron&#8208;doped bicyclic systems.Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that sequential two electrocyclic reactions involving&#160;E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety proceed via a highly strained&#160;trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8208;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives intense attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains very limited or even unexplored especially when dealing with challenging C&#8208;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8208;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapidly Synthesized Single&#8208;Ion Conductive Hydrogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2 mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248 mAh/g at 1 C), excellent rate capability (90 mAh/g at 10 C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large&#8208;scaled flexible high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine oximes producing from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH, exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8 % and a yield of 92.1%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8208;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in&#8208;situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Membraneless Droplets for Synaptic&#8208;Like Clustering of Lipid Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In eukaryotic cells, the membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are found to interact intimately with membranous organelles (MOs). One major mode is the clustering of MOs by MLOs, such as the formation of clusters of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals mediated by the synapsin&#8208;rich MLOs. Aqueous droplets, including complex coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems, have been plausible MLO&#8208;mimics to emulate or elucidate biological processes. However, neither of them can cluster lipid vesicles (LVs) like MLOs. In this work, we develop a synthetic droplet assembled from a combination of two different interactions underlying the formation of these two droplets, namely, associative and segregative interactions, which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets. The SA droplets cluster and disperse LVs recapitulating the key functional features of synapsin condensates, which can be attributed to the weak electrostatic interaction environment provided by SA droplets. This work suggests LLPS with combined segregative and associative interactions as a possible route for synaptic clustering of lipid vesicles and highlights SA droplets as plausible MLO&#8208;mimics and models for studying and mimicking related cellular dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Interfacial Manipulation against Dendrite Growth and Side Reactions for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing multifunctional interphases to suppress the rampant Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions is crucial for Zn anodes. Herein, a phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a versatile interphase layer to stabilize Zn anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer can manipulate Zn2+ flux and promote rapid desolvation kinetics, ensuring the uniform Zn deposition with dendrite&#8208;free morphology. Moreover, the robust PA&#8208;ZnAl protective layer can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of byproducts, further contributing to the reversible Zn plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, the Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650 h tested at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

As a result, the Zn@PA-ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA-ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650 h tested at 5 mA cm-2 and 5 mAh cm-2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA-ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Straightforward Method for the Generation of Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen with a Partially Negative Line</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen molecule, which exists in two spin isomers (ortho&#8208; and parahydrogen), is a highly studied system due to its fundamental properties and practical applications. Parahydrogen is used for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement, which is hyperpolarization of other molecules, including biorelevant ones. Hyperpolarization can be achieved by using Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). SABRE can also convert parahydrogen into orthohydrogen, and surprisingly, in some cases, it has been discovered that orthohydrogen&#8217;s resonance has the Partially Negative Line (PNL) pattern. Here, an approach for obtaining orthohydrogen with a PNL signal is presented for two catalysts: Ir&#8208;IMes, and Ir&#8208;IMesBn. The type of solvent in which SABRE is conducted is crucial for the observation of PNL. Specifically, a PNL signal can be easily generated in benzene using both catalysts, but it is more intense for Ir&#8208;IMesBn. In acetone, PNL is observed only for Ir&#8208;IMesBn. In methanol, no PNL is detected. The PNL effect is only detectable during the initial steps of pre&#8208;catalyst activation, and disappears as the activation process progresses. We have proposed a working hypothesis that explains our results. The presented data may facilitate the further investigation of PNL and its applications in material science and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>N,O&#8208;Benzylidene Acetal Dipeptides (NBDs) Enable the Synthesis of Difficult Peptides via a Kinked Backbone Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) can serve as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and highly effective building blocks to enable syntheses of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked peptide backbone strategy. The scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis and the proven effectiveness for the synthesis of difficult peptides render NBDs valuable tools for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications.







Abstract
Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow the direct synthesis of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides and proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone, and glycosylated erythropoietin.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis Towards Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy was developed to facilitate both C2H4 epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2 reduction to C2H4 for improved tandem electrosynthesis of EO from CO2 and water, using single&#8208;atom Pt anchored on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) with a high atomic utilization and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O with stable Cu+ species as highly efficient anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively.







Abstract
The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently has a mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4 to EO and CO2 to C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediate binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2&#8201;%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9&#8201;% at 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to those in the traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE as high as 41.1&#8201;% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.

         <title>Merging the Isonitrile&#8208;Tetrazine (4+1) Cycloaddition and the Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction into a Single Multicomponent Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multicomponent process combining the features of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4 +1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction was developed. The multicomponent reaction takes advantage of the click reactivities of the first step and provides access to so&#8208;far inaccessible chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a tool for peptide modification and stapling.

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(Alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system has been developed for efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores with high site selectivity. The excellent functional group compatibility, scalability, use of readily available starting materials, and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization underscore the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2-aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2-aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2-aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks is developed for achieving the enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in alcohol&#8208;containing solutions without any sacrificial agent.







Abstract
We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4&#8197;h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.

         <title>Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyze&#160;CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>

         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost and efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable fuels is desirable to realize a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we report that polymer dots (Pdots) of poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT) without adding any extra co&#8208;catalyst can photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO in aqueous solution, rendering a CO production rate of 57 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with a detectable selectivity of up to 100%. 5 cycles of CO2 re&#8208;purging experiments show no distinct decline in CO amount and reaction rate, indicating the promising photocatalytic stability of PFBT Pdots in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Mechanistic study reveals that photo&#8208;excited PFBT Pdots are reduced by TEOA first, then the reduced PFBT Pdots can bind CO2 and reduce it into CO via their intrinsic active sites. This work highlights the application of organic Pdots for CO2 reduction in the aqueous solution, which therefore provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly nanoparticular photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of resonance and non&#8208;resonance chiral Raman scattering in a cobalt(III) complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra with high sensitivity reveal details on molecular structure, chirality, and excited electronic properties. Despite the difficulty of the measurements, the recorded data for the Co(III) complex with S,S&#8208;N,N&#8208;ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid are of exceptional quality and, coupled with the theory, spectacularly document the molecular behavior in resonance. This includes a huge enhancement of the chiral scattering, contribution of the antisymmetric polarizabilities to the signal, and the Herzberg&#8208;Teller effect significantly shaping the spectra. The chiral component is by about one order of magnitude bigger than for an analogous aluminum complex. The band assignment and intensity profile were confirmed by simulations based on density functional and vibronic theories. The resonance was attributed to the S0&#174;S3 transition, with the strongest signal enhancement of Raman and ROA spectral bands below about 800 cm&#8208;1. For higher wavenumbers, other excited electronic states contribute to the scattering in a less resonant way. RROA spectroscopy thus appears as a unique tool to study the structure and electronic states of absorbing molecules in analytical chemistry, biology, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow for White&#8208;Light Emission and Information Encryption Based on Carbazole Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;mode emission materials, combining phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, offer promising opportunities for white&#8208;light afterglow. However, the delayed fluorescence lifetime is usually significantly shorter than that of phosphorescence, limiting the duration of white&#8208;light emission. In this study, a carbazole&#8208;based host&#8208;guest system that can be activated by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light is reported to achieve balanced phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, resulting in a long&#8208;lived white&#8208;light afterglow. Our study demonstrated the critical role of a charge transfer state in the afterglow mechanism, where the charge separation and recombination process directly determined the lifetime of afterglow. Simultaneously, an efficient reversed intersystem crossing process was obtained between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states, which further boosted the delayed fluorescence properties of the doping system. As a result, delayed fluorescence lifetime was successfully prolonged to approach that of phosphorescence. This work presents a delayed fluorescence lifetime improvement strategy via doping method to realize durable white&#8208;light afterglow.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1 eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8208;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia via Tuning of N&#8208;Intermediate Adsorption on a Zn&#8722;Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped Cu catalyst is used for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. The Faradaic efficiency of NH3 can reach 98.4&#8201;% with a yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1. The Zn dopants play a key role in modulating the adsorption strength of intermediates, enhancing the conversion of nitrite, altering the configuration of adsorbed *NO species to bridge adsorption, and reducing the energy barrier, leading to the high catalytic performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;powered electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) has garnered significant interest as an eco&#8208;friendly and promising substitute for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N&#8208;containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn&#8208;doped Cu nanosheets, and the as&#8208;prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4&#8201;% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90&#8201;% across a wide potential range and NO3&#8722; concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2&#8722; conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Distinct Selectivity Control in Solar&#8208;Driven Bio&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyl Acid Conversion: A Comparison of Pt Nanoparticles and Atomically Dispersed Pt on CdS</title>

         <dc:description>
Distinct selectivity control along with highly efficient H2 production are achieved in photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids by tuning the nature of Pt species deposited on CdS.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8722;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to the oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8722;S bonds promote the activation of the hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.

         <title>Alternatives to Styrene&#8208; and Diisobutylene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene&#8208; and diisobutylene&#8208;based amphiphilic copolymers are invaluable tools for the extraction of integral membrane proteins. However, they have several issues that limit their efficacy and applicability. A tailorable polymeric platform is now introduced that overcomes many of these limitations, including having low UV absorbance, high protein extraction yields, and retention of native&#8208;like protein structure, as well as being readily synthesized.







Abstract
Styrene&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (SMAs), and related amphiphilic copolymers, are promising tools for isolating and studying integral membrane proteins in a native&#8208;like state. However, they do not exhibit this ability universally, as several reports have found that SMAs and related amphiphilic copolymers show little to no efficiency when extracting specific membrane proteins. Recently, it was discovered that esterified SMAs could enhance the selective extraction of trimeric Photosystem I from the thylakoid membranes of thermophilic cyanobacteria; however, these polymers are susceptible to saponification that can result from harsh preparation or storage conditions. To address this concern, we herein describe the development of &#945;&#8208;olefin&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (&#945;MAs) that can extract trimeric PSI from cyanobacterial membranes with the highest extraction efficiencies observed when using any amphiphilic copolymers, including diisobutylene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic acid (DIBMA) and functionalized SMA samples. Furthermore, we will show that &#945;MAs facilitate the formation of photosystem I&#8208;containing nanodiscs that retain an annulus of native lipids and a native&#8208;like activity. We also highlight how &#945;MAs provide an agile, tailorable synthetic platform that enables fine&#8208;tuning hydrophobicity, controllable molar mass, and consistent monomer incorporation while overcoming shortcomings of prior amphiphilic copolymers.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh clusters undergo partial dispersion upon exposure to oxygen at room temperature. The extent of dispersion increases at higher temperatures and is higher for smaller clusters. The dispersed Rh single atoms show two orders of magnitude higher activity than nanoparticles.







Abstract
Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130&#8197;kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally similar analogues of ADT and NDT are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer for organic solar cells. It is found that the molecular packing behaviors and volatilization of solid additive show significant impact in regulating the morphological properties of photoactive layer, and thus photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Two structurally similar analogues of ADT and NDT are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;-stacking of photoactive layer for organic solar cells. It is found that the molecular packing behaviors and volatilization of solid additive show significant impact in regulating the morphological properties of photoactive layer, and thus photovoltaic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high-performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;6,7-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;5,6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;-stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face-on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long-range &#960;-&#960; stacking in the out-of-plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge-to-face stacked herringbone-arrangement of ADT along with its non-volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face-on and edge-on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85&#8201;% is achieved in the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO-based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41&#8201;% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Microcapsules Harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 Immune Response for Cancer Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vector&#8208;functionalized lentivirus&#8208;loaded DNA tetrahedra&#8208;modified stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogel microcapsules act as active carriers for gene expression in cancer cells and immunogenetic therapy of cancer cells. This is exemplified by designing Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP)&#8208;aptamer or miRNA&#8208;responsive carriers, expressing green fluorescence protein and the AFP&#8208;stimulated expression of the spike protein, harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 immune response for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy concepts, along recent advances in DNA nanotechnology, have the potential to provide important tools for cancer therapies. We present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive microcapsules, loaded with a viral immunogenetic agent, harnessing the immune response against the Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID&#8208;19, to selectively attack liver cancer cells (hepatoma) or recognize breast cancer or hepatoma, by expression of green fluorescence protein, GFP. The pH&#8208;responsive microcapsules, modified with DNA&#8208;tetrahedra nanostructures, increased hepatoma permeation by 50&#8201;%. Incorporation of a GFP&#8208;encoding lentivirus vector inside the tumor&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;stimulated miRNA&#8208;triggered and Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein&#8208;dictated microcapsules enables the demonstration of neoplasm selectivity, with approximately 5,000&#8208;, 8,000&#8208; and 50,000&#8208;fold more expression in the cancerous cells, respectively. The incorporation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in the gene vector promotes specific recognition of the immune&#8208;evading hepatoma by the COVID&#8208;19&#8208;analogous immune response, which leads to cytotoxic and inflammatory activity, mediated by serum components taken from vaccinated or recovered COVID&#8208;19 patients, resulting in effective elimination of the hepatoma (&gt;85&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Catalytic Photochemical Deracemization via Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical deracemization offers a unique opportunity to directly obtain enantiopure compounds from their racemates. Short&#8208;lived intermediates play a key role in the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The review covers comprehensively the research performed in the area and discusses current developments.







Abstract
Upon irradiation in the presence of a suitable chiral catalyst, racemic compound mixtures can be converted into enantiomerically pure compounds with the same constitution. The process is called photochemical deracemization and involves the formation of short&#8208;lived intermediates. By opening different reaction channels for the forward reaction to the intermediate and for the re&#8208;constitution of the chiral molecule, the entropically disfavored process becomes feasible. Since the discovery of the first photochemical deracemization in 2018, the field has been growing rapidly. This review comprehensively covers the research performed in the area and discusses current developments. It is subdivided according to the mode of action and the respective substrate classes. The focus of this review is on the scope of the individual reactions and on a discussion of the mechanistic details underlying the presented reaction.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host have been prepared and used to stain living cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging for the first time. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells indicate the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.







Abstract
Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic host has been synthesised. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.

         <title>Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable and self&#8208;healable liquid crystal elastomer actuator was synthesized by integrating dynamic halogen bonds into an Aza&#8211;Michael addition&#8208;based elastomer network. The obtained LCE not only exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties without destroying the liquid crystalline alignment but also allows for dynamic shape programming and corresponding soft robotic demonstrations.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape&#8208;morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self&#8208;healing ability. Here, we report halogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape&#8208;programmed and that self&#8208;heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self&#8208;healing. Utilizing the halogen&#8208;bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the polar and acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH and medium&#8208;dependent emission signals, which complicates bioimaging experimental design and reduces the data reliability. We developed a single&#8208;step functionalization that makes phenolic fluorophores pH and medium&#8208;resistant. The new fluorophores can be used for high&#8208;fidelity sensing and bioimaging applications.







Abstract
Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the environment&#8208;patrolling behavior of biological dendrite cells for pathogen inactivation, a dynamic patrolling system targeted to cycling&#8208;induced defects of solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes. Owing to the self&#8208;repairing feature of zincophilic SEI empowered by lithium bis(oxalate)borate additive, Zn anode presents an impressive lifespan up to 1800&#8197;h at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, attaining a fabulous cumulative capacity of 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800&#8197;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO2 as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on&#8208;line setup showed the high valence state of IrIV worked as active species.







Abstract
For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO2 and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO2&#8208;formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. During charging&#8208;discharging, in situ fluorescence X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy based on an online setup indicated that the active species was in a high valence state of IrIV.

         <title>Exploiting the Use of the Decarboxylative S&#8208;Alkylation Reaction to Produce Self&#8208;Blowing, Recyclable Polycarbonate Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;blown polycarbonate foam was prepared by exploiting the use of decarboxylative S&#8208;alkylation to generate CO2 in situ.







Abstract
Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Cleavage of Lignin Models by a Soluble Perylene Diimide/Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene diimide (PDI) S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst selectively cleaves the C&#8722;C bond of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Rigid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) enhances organic solvent solubility and inhibits agglomeration of the PDI. Synergy between POSS and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions enables efficient dispersion of POSS&#8208;PDI on a carbon nitride surface for better solar utilization and accelerated charge separation.







Abstract
3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors and an ideal light&#8208;driven catalyst for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3&#8201;% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.

Notably, the 3&#8201;% p-CN/P-PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS-PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p-CN), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Motorized Photomodulator: Making A Non&#8208;photoresponsive Supramolecular Gel Switchable by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a molecular motor as a photoswitchable cross&#8208;linker that co&#8208;assembles with a non&#8208;photoresponsive gelator enables reversible control over gel and solution states. This has led to a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system that has the ability to respond to light irradiation, with creation of a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition.







Abstract
Introducing photo&#8208;responsive molecules offers an attractive approach for remote and selective control and dynamic manipulation of material properties. However, it remains highly challenging how to use a minimal amount of photo&#8208;responsive units to optically modulate materials that are inherently inert to light irradiation. Here we show the application of a light&#8208;driven rotary molecular motor as a &#8220;motorized photo&#8208;modulator&#8221; to endow a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system with the ability to respond to light irradiation and create a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition. The key molecular design feature is the introduction of a minimal amount (2&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of molecular motors into the supramolecular network as photo&#8208;switchable non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers. Advantage is taken of the subtle interplay of the large geometry change during photo&#8208;isomerization of the molecular motor guest and the dynamic nature of a supramolecular gel host system. As a result, a tiny amount of molecular motors is enough to switch the mechanical modulus of the entire supramolecular systems. This study proves the concept of designing photo&#8208;responsive materials with minimum use of non&#8208;covalent light&#8208;absorbing units.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) enables high rate capability and stable cycling of Na&#8214;Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% and a capacity retention of more than 84&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1&#8197;V at 40&#8201;&#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2&#8197;C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8722;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS, operando XAFS measurements, and DFT calculations revealed that Fe1&#8208;P/NG accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process of CO2 electroreduction by promoting the dissociation of water over the P sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8722;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1&#8197;A with FECO over 90&#8201;% at 2.5&#8197;V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300&#8201;%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>A Spatially Programmable DNA Nanorobot Arm to Modulate Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticle Assembly by Enzymatic Excision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate the anisotropic assembly of DNA/AuNP superstructures. By specifically controlling nicking excisions on the AuNP surfaces, DNA modifications were generated on a single nanoparticle, thus facilitating anisotropic AuNP assembly. The SPEE strategy is extended to DNA origami surfaces to establish a AuNP assembly platform in a programmable spatially regulated manner.







Abstract
Programmable assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures with precise spatial arrangement has drawn much attention for their unique characteristics in plasmonics and biomedicine. Bio&#8208;inspired methods have already provided programmable, molecular approaches to direct AuNP assemblies using biopolymers. The existing methods, however, predominantly use DNA as scaffolds to directly guide the AuNP interactions to produce intended superstructures. New paradigms for regulating AuNP assembly will greatly enrich the toolbox for DNA&#8208;directed AuNP manipulation and fabrication. Here, we developed a strategy of using a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate anisotropic DNA surface modifications and assembly of AuNPs. Through spatial controls of the proximity of the reactants, the locations of the modifications were precisely regulated. We demonstrated the control of the modifications on a single 15&#8197;nm AuNP, as well as on a rectangular DNA origami platform, to direct unique anisotropic AuNP assemblies. This method adds an alternative enzymatic manipulation to DNA&#8208;directed AuNP superstructure assembly.

         <title>Degradable and Recyclable Polyesters from Multiple Chain Length Bio&#8208; and Waste&#8208;Sourceable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters derived from multiple chain length dicarboxylate feedstocks, as obtained from valorization of waste polyethylene or oxidation of bio&#8208;based fatty acids, exhibit high density polyethylene&#8208;like properties, are ductile materials processable into films and fibers, and can be depolymerized enabling chemical recycling or biodegradation in the environment.







Abstract
Monomers sourced from waste or biomass are often mixtures of different chain lengths; e.g. catalytic oxidation of polyethylene waste yields mixtures of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs). Yet, polyesters synthesized from such monomer mixtures have rarely been studied. We report polyesters based on multiple linear aliphatic DCAs, present in chain length distributions that vary in their centers and ranges. We demonstrate that these materials can adopt high&#8208;density polyethylene&#8208;like solid state structures, and are ductile (e.g. Et 610&#8197;MPa), allowing for injection molding, or film and fiber extrusion. Melting and crystallization points of the polyesters show no odd&#8208;even effects as dipoles cannot favorably align in the crystal, similar to traditional odd carbon numbered, long&#8208;chain DCA polyesters. Biodegradation studies of 13C&#8208;labelled polyesters in soil reveal rapid mineralization, and depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

We demonstrate that these materials can adopt high-density polyethylene-like solid state structures, and are ductile (e.g. E&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; 610&#8197;MPa), allowing for injection molding, or film and fiber extrusion. Melting and crystallization points of the polyesters show no odd-even effects as dipoles cannot favorably align in the crystal, similar to traditional odd carbon numbered, long-chain DCA polyesters. Biodegradation studies of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labelled polyesters in soil reveal rapid mineralization, and depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed-loop recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing for the Detection of MicroRNAs: Towards Liquid Biopsy on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of point of care (PoC) devices for miRNA detection in clinical oncology is urgently needed. Here, the main field of applications and the most promising biosensing platforms for sensitive miRNA detection are discussed. The need to establish multidisciplinary networks to boost biosensing technologies and bring them to the clinic to develop and spread PoC is also highlighted. The outlook is to improve the access to molecular diagnostics tools to all patients.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) testing is revolutionizing the healthcare sector improving patient care in daily hospital practice and allowing reaching even remote geographical areas. In the frame of cancer management, the design and validation of PoC enabling the non&#8208;invasive, rapid detection of cancer markers is urgently required to implement liquid biopsy in clinical practice. Therefore, focusing on stable blood&#8208;based markers with high&#8208;specificity, such as microRNAs, is of crucial importance. In this work, we highlight the potential impact of circulating microRNAs detection on cancer management and the crucial role of PoC testing devices, especially for low&#8208;income countries. A detailed discussion about the challenges that should be faced to promote the technological transfer and clinical use of these tools has been added, to provide the readers with a complete overview of potentialities and current limitations.

         <title>Retrosynthetic Analysis Applied to Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis of Four Rh(II)&#8208;Based Complexes as Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a retrosynthetic analysis step based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds enables defining the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this new approach is used to synthesize four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.







Abstract
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry is a synthetic strategy that our group previously developed to obtain new molecules and materials through selective cleavage of bonds. Herein, we report recent work to expand Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by introducing into it a retrosynthetic analysis step that, based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds, enables one to define the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have validated our new approach by synthesising and characterising four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MFI&#8208;Type Zeolite Flow Battery Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membranes with sub&#8208;nano&#8208;straight channels effectively inhibit the migration of vanadium ions while accelerating the proton transport, which enables good flow battery performance.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) is one of the most reliable stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage technologies, and a membrane with high vanadium resistance and proton conductivity is essential for manufacturing high&#8208;performance VFBs. In this study, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane was fabricated from zeolite nanosheet modules, which displayed excellent vanadium resistance (0.07&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and proton conductivity (0.16&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), yielding a coulombic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;%, a voltage efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency of 82.3&#8201;% at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The self&#8208;discharge period of a VFB equipped with 2D MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane increased up to 116.2&#8197;h, which was significantly longer than that of the commercial perfluorinated sulfonate membrane (45.9&#8197;h). Furthermore, the corresponding battery performance remained stable over 1000 cycles (&gt;1500&#8197;h) at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These findings demonstrate that 2D MFI&#8208;type membranes are promising ion&#8208;conductive membranes applicable for stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones has been accomplished via synergistic HOMO and LUMO activation by means of manganese and iminium catalysis. The use of chiral organocatalysts could provide the corresponding products with moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system. In this communication, we disclose a cooperative catalysis strategy of manganese and iminium catalysis to realize selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Its success stems from the LUMO activation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds with secondary amines as the organocatalyst and the synergistic HOMO activation of alkenylboronic acids with Mn2(CO)8Br2. This protocol exhibits several synthetic advances, e.g., simple operation, good functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. The theoretical calculation indicates the migratory insertion followed by demetallation&#8208;isomerization process is kinetically more favorable than Michael&#8208;like nucleophilic addition. The use of proline&#8208;derived organocatalyst can deliver the desired products in moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>S&#8208;Block Potassium Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalyst with K&#8722;N4 Configuration Derived from K+/Polydopamine for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An s&#8208;block Potassium single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a K&#8208;N4 configuration was prepared and used as a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is attributed to K/C atoms acting as dual adsorption sites, which can synergistically optimize the free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and tune the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Currently, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) research mainly focuses on transition metal atoms as active centers. Due to their delocalized s/p&#8208;bands, the s&#8208;block main group metal elements are typically regarded as catalytically inert. Herein, an s&#8208;block potassium SAC (K&#8722;N&#8722;C) with K&#8208;N4 configuration is reported for the first time, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) is up to 0.908&#8197;V, and negligible changes in E1/2 are observed after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the K&#8722;N&#8722;C offers an exceptional power density of 158.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability up to 420&#8197;h in a Zn&#8208;air battery. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that K&#8722;N&#8722;C has bifunctional active K and C sites, can optimize the free energy of ORR reaction intermediates, and adjust the rate&#8208;determining steps. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) results showed that the s orbitals of K played a major role in the adsorption of intermediates, which was different from the d orbitals in transition metals. This work significantly guides the rational design and catalytic mechanism research of s&#8208;block SACs with high ORR activity.

The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) results showed that the s orbitals of K played a major role in the adsorption of intermediates, which was different from the d orbitals in transition metals. This work significantly guides the rational design and catalytic mechanism research of s-block SACs with high ORR activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Cobalt/Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysts for Synergistically Boosting Hydrogen Generation from Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N&#8208;coordinated Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites were designed and constructed for improved dehydrogenation of formic acid. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites synergistically improve the performance of the optimized catalytic system. The presented work describes catalysts based on low&#8208;cost earth abundant dual&#8208;metal sites as promising candidates for H2 storage and delivery.







Abstract
The development of practical materials for (de)hydrogenation reactions is a prerequisite for the launch of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, we present the design and construction of an atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal site Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst allowing significantly improved dehydrogenation of formic acid, which is available from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. The active catalyst centers consist of specific CoCuN6 moieties with double&#8208;N&#8208;bridged adjacent metal&#8208;N4 clusters decorated on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support. At optimal conditions the dehydrogenation performance of the nanostructured material (mass activity 77.7&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) is up to 40&#8197;times higher compared to commercial 5&#8201;% Pd/C. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic isotope effect experiments indicate that Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C promoted formic acid dehydrogenation follows the so&#8208;called formate pathway with the C&#8722;H dissociation of HCOO* as the rate&#8208;determining step. Theoretical calculations reveal that Cu in the CoCuN6 moiety synergistically contributes to the adsorption of intermediate HCOO* and raises the d&#8208;band center of Co to favor HCOO* activation and thereby lower the reaction energy barrier.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Radical&#8208;Radical Heterocoupling Boosts Photodriven Oxidative Esterification of Benzyl Alcohol over Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co@NC catalyst combined the action of localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and photothermal conversion to deliver high reaction rates and selectivity for the oxidation of alcohols to esters under base&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic activity increased by a factor of 7.8 compared with that under direct heating.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of alcohols under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in the bulk and fine chemical industry, which usually requires environmentally unfriendly oxidants and bases that are difficult to separate. Here, a plasmonic catalyst of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Co nanoparticles (Co@NC) with an excellent catalytic activity towards selective oxidation of alcohols is demonstrated. With light as only energy input, the plasmonic Co@NC catalyst effectively operates via combining action of the localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the photothermal effects to achieve a factor of 7.8&#8197;times improvement compared with the activity of thermocatalysis. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 15.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 is obtained under base&#8208;free conditions, which surpasses all the reported catalytic performances of thermocatalytic analogues in the literature. Detailed characterization reveals that the d states of metallic Co gain the absorbed light energy, so the excitation of interband d&#8208;to&#8208;s transitions generates energetic electrons. LSPR&#8208;mediated charge injection to the Co@NC surface activates molecular oxygen and alcohol molecules adsorbed on its surface to generate the corresponding radical species (e.g., &#8901;O2&#8722;, CH3O&#8901; and R&#8208;&#8901;CH&#8208;OH). The formation of multi&#8208;type radical species creates a direct and forward pathway of oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol to speed up the production of esters.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, economical, and direct approach to access &#945;,&#946;&#8208;deuterated styrene compounds via triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;mediated electrochemical deuteration of styrenes and derivatives through electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT) has been developed. This approach tolerated a wide range of styrenes and 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, and the extension to late stage deuteration of complex molecules and their derivatives showed a potential prospect.







Abstract
Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.

         <title>Water&#8208;Promoted Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage Employing a Reusable Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and robust nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits highly selective C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage reactivity in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O) under comparably mild conditions. The present atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N sites can efficiently activate O2 and H2O to generate singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species, which take selectively part in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage and lead to a significant promotion in activity.







Abstract
The development of methods for selective cleavage reactions of thermodynamically stable C&#8722;C/C=C bonds in a green manner is a challenging research field which is largely unexplored. Herein, we present a heterogeneous Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with highly dispersed iron centers that allows for the oxidative C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage of amines, secondary alcohols, ketones, and olefins in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O). Mechanistic studies reveal the presence of water to be essential for the performance of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C system, boosting the product yield from &lt;1&#8201;% to &gt;90&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and control experiments suggest the singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species generated from O2 and H2O, respectively, take selectively part in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The broad applicability (&gt;40 examples) even for complex drugs as well as high activity, selectivity, and durability under comparably mild conditions highlight this unique catalytic system.

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks with well&#8208;organized low&#8208;dimensional architectures provide significant thermodynamic and/or kinetic benefits for diverse applications. We present here the controlled synthesis of a novel class of hierarchical zirconium&#8208;porphyrin frameworks (ZrPHPs) with nanosheet&#8208;assembled hexagonal prism morphology. The crystal growth behaviors and structural evolution of ZrPHPs in an additive&#8208;modulated hydrothermal synthesis are examined, showing an &#8220;assembly&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;reassembly&#8221; mechanism towards the formation of 2D nanosheets with ordered arrangement. Because of the highly&#8208;accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, ZrPHPs serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo&#8208;induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, ZrPHPs provides a surface&#8208;confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly&#8208;efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (Mn &gt; 1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&#272; ~ 1.5).</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Uniform DNA Monolayers Generated by Freezing&#8208;Directed Assembly on Gold Surfaces Enable Robust Electrochemical Sensing in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl Sulfonium Salt&#8208;based&#160;Reagents for Introduction of Deuterated Alkyl Groups in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8211;H bonds with the more stable C&#8211;D bonds at the alpha&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for CYP. However, the application of deuterated synthons is limited. Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing breakthrough deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complicated drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the alpha&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts (1&#8208;dn), prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, 1&#8208;dn was efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkylazide/halides as coupling partners and dn&#8208;alkylamine as nucleophiles. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studys revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone. The present concept for the synthesis of deuterated reagents and the first demonstration of KIE in a d2&#8208;ethoxy group will contribute to drug discovery research based on deuterium chemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400 mA g&#8208;1 for 1800 h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96 V even at high current densities up to 5 A g&#8208;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;substituted Diamide and its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states, as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule&#8217;s torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8208;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones alone. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.</dc:description>

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed with identification of bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) to play a dual role: efficient Lewis acid and source of bromide nucleophile. This work represents a novel and efficient approach for the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo [3.3.1] nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform in the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products or drug molecules. The substrate scope was investigated with 27 successful examples that employ 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes as diverse substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization with good to excellent yields. Finally, we showcased the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total syntheses of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in total 9&#8208;14 steps. This work significantly expands the synthetic utility of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized.

Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334 nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).

Furthermore, through designing Yb3+&#160;doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+&#160;in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lead-free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self-trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti-thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s-p transitions) and Yb3+ (f-f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334 nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980 nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti-thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+&#160;doping, the up-conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow-to-orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red-to-green). Through a combined experimental-theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+&#160;in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500 nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8208;H bond (where X = O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8208;H. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8208;H/C&#8208;S double insertion, and C&#8208;S/Y&#8208;H double insertion (where Y = S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8211;temperature&#8211;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500 &#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built-in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress-strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress-strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Thermo&#8208;Driven Azoarene&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Molecular Switch in a Liquid Crystal Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;driven azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch has been designed. Reversible modulation of the polarization inversion and on&#8208;off&#8208;switchable circularly polarized luminescence in a helical superstructure have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with an (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or the same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light and 520&#8197;nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV and 520&#8197;nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Judicious selection of coordination ligands has led to the first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral M30 cluster. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 in the triple core&#8211;shell cuprofullerene (C60@Cu30@Cl36N12) explains the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral Cu30 in a (&#956;30&#8208;(&#951;2)30)&#8208;fashion, namely C60@Cu30@Cl36N12, has been successfully realized by a C60&#8208;templated assembly. The 48 outmost coordinating atoms (36Cl+12N) comprise a new simple polyhedron that is described by a ccf topology. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 explains the expansion of the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency. This work makes a giant step forward in exohedral metallofullerene (ExMF) chemistry.

         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl alkyl thioethers are an underutilized class of alkyl radical precursors that are demonstrated to outperform their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues under electroreductive conditions. Single electron transfer results in C&#8722;S bond cleavage and alkyl radicals that may react in C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond forming events or undergo radical&#8208;polar crossover, followed by protonation or carboxylation to furnish alkanes or arylacetic acids.







Abstract
Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class. In this vein, electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A (3+2) annulation reaction has been used to synthesize diazulenorubicenes (DARs), non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings. These compounds show red&#8208;shifted absorptions, low LUMO energies, aromaticity switching, and high charge mobilities up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, on&#8208;surface synthesis with the DAR compounds leads to large non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized by a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes, and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2&#8201;b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19&#8197;rings was achieved through on&#8208;surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.

         <title>Template&#8208;Oriented Polyaniline&#8208;Supported Palladium Nanoclusters for Reductive Homocoupling of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pd/PANI catalysts with tunable morphologies and structures was prepared by using crystalline MnO2 as a sacrificial template. The various oxidation states of the support and the coordination modes of metal in the Pd/PANI catalysts led to differences in metal dispersion and electron structure. The most electron&#8208;rich Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI nanocluster catalyst showed the highest TOF for reductive coupling to afford a bifuran ester as a bio&#8208;plasticizer with extremely low migration resistance.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined structures and desired properties for porous organic polymer (POP) supported catalysts by controlling their composition, size, and morphology is of great significance. Herein, we report a preparation of polyaniline (PANI) supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable structure and morphology. The protocol involves the introduction of MnO2 with different crystal structures (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;) serving as both the reaction template and the oxidant. The different forms of MnO2 each convert aniline to a PANI that contains a unique regular distribution of benzene and quinone. This leads to the Pd/PANI catalysts with different charge transfer properties between Pd and PANI, as well as different dispersions of the metal NPs. In this case, the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst greatly improves the turnover frequency (TOF; to 88.3&#8197;h&#8722;1), in the reductive coupling of furfural derivatives to potential bio&#8208;based plasticizers. Systematic characterizations reveal the unique oxidation state of the support in the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst and coordination mode of Pd that drives the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoclusters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the more electron rich Pd/PANI catalyst has the lower energy barrier in the oxidative addition step, which favors the C&#8722;C coupling reaction.

         <title>Stabilizing Solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries through In Situ Generated Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF&#8208;rich SEI in Ionic Liquid Confined 3D MOF/Polymer Membranes</title>

An ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.







Abstract
Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging.

Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes, showing superior room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transfer number of 0.82. The cryo&#8208;TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li3N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into the Carbon&#8208;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed aryne insertion into heteroaryl C&#8722;I bonds to access valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls, characterized by high efficiency and selectivity, has first been realized. The newly discovered Lewis acid catalyzed insertion model opens up numerous opportunities for the further development of aryne chemistry.







Abstract
Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine bonds.

         <title>Versatile Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications of Helical &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers Derived from a Thioether&#8208;Containing Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of &#946;&#8208;peptides containing cyclic thioether side chains adopted a 12&#8208;helical conformation, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR, and circular dichroism. Post&#8208;synthetic modifications, such as oxidation, desulfurization, and notably chemoselective conjugation, highlighted the unique potential of the methionine&#8208;like building block for diverse applications in peptidomimetic systems.







Abstract
We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.

         <title>Synergic Electron and Defect Compensation Minimizes Voltage Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic electron and defect compensation on Sn perovskites has been realized via alloying heterovalent metal halide salts. This concurrently optimized the interfacial carrier dynamics, compensated the prevailing vacancy defects and minimized the nonradiative recombination loss throughout the devices, thus affording best efficiency up to 14.02&#8201;% characterized by a record high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V and the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;V.







Abstract
Sn perovskite solar cells have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the Sn perovskites are notorious to feature heavy p&#8208;doping characteristics and possess abundant vacancy defects, which result in under&#8208;optimized interfacial energy level alignment and severe nonradiative recombination. Here, we reported a synergic &#8220;electron and defect compensation&#8221; strategy to simultaneously modulate the electronic structures and defect profiles of Sn perovskites via incorporating a traced amount (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of heterovalent metal halide salts. Consequently, the doping level of modified Sn perovskites was altered from heavy p&#8208;type to weak p&#8208;type (i.e. up&#8208;shifting the Fermi level by &#8764;0.12&#8197;eV) that determinately reducing the barrier of interfacial charge extraction and effectively suppressing the charge recombination loss throughout the bulk perovskite film and at relevant interfaces. Pioneeringly, the resultant device modified with electron and defect compensation realized a champion efficiency of 14.02&#8201;%, which is &#8764;46&#8201;% higher than that of control device (9.56&#8201;%). Notably, a record&#8208;high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V was attained, corresponding to the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;eV reported to date, and narrowing the gap with Pb&#8208;based analogues (&#8764;0.30&#8197;V).

         <title>Myocardial&#8208;Targeting Tannic Cerium Nanocatalyst Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidant properties have been synthesized. The nanocatalysts were used to treat myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, protecting cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage and preserving myocardial functionality.







Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Medications or surgery have been considered as effective protocols to treat IHD for decades. Yet the reperfusion of the blood flow frequently leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing prominent and irreversible damage to the cardiomyocytes. In the present work, tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidation capability have been synthesized and applied for the effective and biocompatible ischemia/reperfusion injury therapeutics. TA&#8722;Ce nanocatalysts could effectively rescue the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 challenge as well as oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation in vitro. In the murine ischemia/reperfusion model, cardiac accumulation and intracellular ROS scavenging could be achieved against the pathology, substantially reducing the myocardial infarct area and recovering heart functionality. This work illuminates the design of nanocatalytic metal complexes and their therapeutic prospects in ischemic heart diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility, paving the way for the clinical translation from bench to bedside.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Foldamer&#8208;Based Artificial Lithium Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pivaloyl chloride as a mild one&#8208;pot copolymerization agent, we successfully constructed a novel class of sulfur&#8208;containing aromatic amide helices. Having an average height of 2.1&#8197;nm, 3.6&#8197;&#197; in cavity diameter and helically arranged S&#8208; and O&#8208;atoms along the inner wall, these nanotubes display highly selective and efficient transmembrane lithium transport, with transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.







Abstract
Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8722;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for Li+ ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with Na+ ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6&#8197;&#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High&#8208;resolution imaging with CO&#8208;modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208; oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases.

&lt;p&gt;Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High-resolution imaging with CO-modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom-up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic-level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three-dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D- and L-oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis
</title>

         <dc:description>
Use of mechanochemistry enabled the rapid in situ generation of Grignard reagents, thereby overcoming the longstanding limitations of the Magnesium&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction in solution.







Abstract
Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, and C&#8722;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties
</title>

The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.







Abstract
The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial biomarker probes (AMPro) are developed for noninvasive urinalysis of acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) in murine models. With advantages of high renal clearance and specific detection of graft&#8208;infiltrating immune cells, AMPros noninvasively detected the onset of ARAR as accurately as invasive flow cytometry analysis, and specifically distinguished ARAR from non&#8208;allograft diseases or non&#8208;alloimmune&#8208;specific inflammatory patterns.







Abstract
Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of Artificial bioMarker Probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.

         <title>Mo&#8722;Ni&#8208;based Heterojunction with Fine&#8208;customized d&#8208;Band Centers for Hydrogen Production Coupled with Benzylamine Electrooxidation in Low Alkaline Medium</title>

         <dc:description>
A biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction was constructed for HER coupled with benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR), where charge transfer causes the upshift of d&#8208;band centers. One side facilitates H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER, the other side favors OH* production from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N to catalyze BAOR effectively. It shows 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and FEs of &gt;99&#8201;% in low alkaline medium.







Abstract
Benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR) is a promising route to produce value&#8208;added, easy&#8208;separated benzonitrile, and effectively hoist H2 production. However, achieving excellent performance in low alkaline medium is a huge challenge. The performance is intimately correlated with effective coupling of HER and BAOR, which can be achieved by manipulating the d&#8208;electron structure of catalyst to regulate the active species from water. Herein, we constructed a biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction for enhanced bifunctional performance toward HER coupled with BAOR by customizing the d&#8208;band centers. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that charge transfer in the heterojunction causes the upshift of the d&#8208;band centers, which one side facilitates to decrease water activation energy and optimize H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER activity, the other side favors to more easily produce and adsorb OH* from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N and optimizing adsorption energy of benzylamine, thus catalyzing BAOR effectively. Accordingly, it shows an industrial current density of 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;99&#8201;%) for H2 production and converting benzylamine to benzonitrile in 0.1&#8197;M KOH/0.5&#8197;M Na2SO4. This work guides the design of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for the scalable production of green hydrogen and value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;Encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

A DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell system, characterized by robust signal amplification through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and adaptable recognition patterns via molecular engineering is reported. The system is shown to function as a versatile, ultrasensitive biosensor.







Abstract
Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA&#8242;s high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive PROTACs for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized caging strategy has been developed to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs. By leveraging pathological cues or external stimuli, we realized selective protein degradation and potent tumor remission in vitro and in vivo, making our caging library a promising tool in designing activatable prodrugs and smart biomaterials.







Abstract
Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising therapeutic modality to address undruggable and resistant issues in drug discovery. However, potential on&#8208;target toxicity remains clinically challenging. We developed a generalized caging strategy to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs (sr&#8208;PROTACs) with diverse molecular blocks bearing robust and cleavable linkers, presenting &#8220;turn on&#8221; features in manipulating protein degradation. By leveraging pathological cues, such as elevated ROS, phosphatase, H2S, or hypoxia, and external triggers, such as ultraviolet light, X&#8208;Ray, or bioorthogonal reagents, we achieved site&#8208;specific activation and traceless release of original PROTACs through de&#8208;caging and subsequent self&#8208;immolative cleavage, realizing selective uptake and controlled protein degradation in vitro. An in vivo study revealed that two sr&#8208;PROTACs with phosphate&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing cages exhibited high solubility and long plasma exposure, which were specifically activated by tumor overexpressing phosphatase or low dosage of X&#8208;Ray irradiation in situ, leading to efficient protein degradation and potent tumor remission. With more reactive biomarkers to be screened from clinical practice, our caging library could provide a general tool to design activatable PROTACs, prodrugs, antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and smart biomaterials for personalized treatment, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine.

         <title>Facile Borylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, Imines, Arenes and Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Boranes and a Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a stable semiconductor material, ultrathin CdS nanosheets, can act as a heterogeneous visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst to orchestrate oxidative and reductive interfacial electron transfers for borylation of assorted alkenes, alkynes, imines and aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane. The low&#8208;cost and easily prepared CdS catalyst can be recovered and reused for several runs with conserved activity.







Abstract
Although the development of radical chain and photocatalytic borylation reactions using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;borane as boron source is remarkable, the persistent problems, including the use of hazardous and high&#8208;energy radical initiators or the recyclability and photostability issues of soluble homogeneous photocatalysts, still leave great room for further development in a sustainable manner. Herein, we report a conceptually different approach toward highly functionalized organoborane synthesis by using recoverable ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanosheets as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, and a general and mild borylation platform that enables regioselective borylation of a wide variety of alkenes (arylethenes, trifluoromethylalkenes, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and nitriles), alkynes, imines and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane as boryl radical precursor. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes on the CdS fully perform their own roles, thereby resulting in enhancement of photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS.

We synthesized three 3D four&#8208;arm small molecules with spirobifluorene as the central core and different end&#8208;group&#8208;modified benzotriazole units as arms. By incorporating four&#8208;arm molecules, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved improved efficiencies of 18.7&#8211;19.1&#8201;%, benefiting from triggered multiple mechanisms and the inhibited excessive aggregation of Y6. Our results open a new avenue for the design of promising guest molecules for ternary OSCs.







Abstract
A third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the preferred ingredient for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3D&#8208;structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three four&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials to the classical system PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1&#8201;%, 18.7&#8201;%, and 18.8&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE=17.4&#8201;%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed (dynamic) kinetic ring&#8208;opening of biaryl oxazepines with water has been disclosed. A wide range of biaryl oxazepine substrates underwent this catalytic asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in a highly enantioselective manner. Key parameters for the success of this reaction are the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions.







Abstract
The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly regioselective hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes through ligand&#8208;free iridium(0) nanoparticle catalysis is described. This novel pathway allows the formation of both new and well&#8208;established H8&#8208;BINAP ligand&#8208;types.







Abstract
Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free iridium (Ir)&#8208;hydride based Ir0 nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in situ generated NPs are catalytically active. A control nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study revealed the presence of metal&#8208;surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir0 species. A control NMR study confirmed that hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of Ir0 in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;BINAP) and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Stereoselective Glycosylation via RhII and Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Cocatalyzed Carbenoid Insertion to the Anomeric OH Bond for the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates</title>

An efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates was reported via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion, achieving excellent anomeric/diastereo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2&#8208;carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8722;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using combinations of machine&#8208;learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high&#8208;entropy materials for catalyst discovery.







Abstract
Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;derived Fluorinated Secondary Interphase for Reversible Zn&#8208;graphite Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer that facilitates reversible anion intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation processes in dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIB) by preventing graphite exfoliation and suppressing solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation is demonstrated. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB with high Coulombic efficiency and an attractive discharge capacity.







Abstract
The irreversibility of anion intercalation&#8208;deintercalation is a fundamental issue in determining the cycling stability of a dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB). In this work, we demonstrate that using a partially fluorinated carbonate solvent can drive a beneficial fluorinated secondary interphase layer formation. Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8722;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB&#8212;a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a mid&#8208;point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7&#8197;V (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self&#8208;discharge behavior, preserving 29&#8197;times of the capacity retention rate compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent, after standing for 24&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite&#8208;based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.

Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8722;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co-intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn-graphite DIB&#8212;a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a mid-point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7&#8197;V (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self-discharge behavior, preserving 29&#8197;times of the capacity retention rate compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent, after standing for 24&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite-based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the chemical synthesis of F2 has been elucidated by experimental and electronic structure theory methods. The elimination of F2 from MnF4 requires a large excess of SbF5 occurring in the last reaction step by addition of SbF5 to the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11]&#8722; anion producing F2 and crystalline Mn[Sb2F11]2.







Abstract
The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn atom thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effectively managing excess lead iodide is crucial for enhancing perovskite stability. An innovative approach, tailoring functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets, stabilizes the perovskite structure and improves charge extraction. This leads to a significant boost in power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells, providing a novel perspective on stabilizing photovoltaic devices.







Abstract
Stability issues could prevent lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from commercialization despite it having a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7&#8201;% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. The devices retain 93.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous reaction cycle for the Wittig reaction has been developed by synthesising a polymer with permanent porosity that incorporates the Wittig reagent. Therefore, the highly energy&#8208;intensive separation process needed in the homogeneous reaction pathway can be avoided. The material described could enable a continuous Wittig process in industry.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin&#8197;A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as a solid Wittig reagent that undergoes, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed for regeneration of the solid Wittig reagent and reuse for the same reaction cycle. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon nanocage substrates for NO3&#8722;RR was designed. The tuning of P increases the electron density of the Fe center, which promotes the adsorption and proton transfer of nitrate ions and related intermediates on the surface of electrocatalyst, leading to the superior NO3&#8722;RR performance at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C) as a NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalyst. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8722;RR process. The Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C catalyst exhibits 90.3&#8201;% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8722;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the critical role of atomic&#8208;level precision modulation by heteroatom doping for the NO3&#8722;RR, providing an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Regulating the Sequence Structure of Conjugated Block Copolymers Enables Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the sequence structure of conjugated block copolymers by two&#8208;pot polymerization, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is obtained which enables single&#8208;component organic solar cells to achieve 13.4&#8201;% efficiency with enhanced stability. In addition, for the first time, large&#8208;area rigid and flexible single&#8208;component organic solar cells are reported with an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;% and 10.73&#8201;%, respectively, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.







Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) by covalently bonding a polymer donor and polymer acceptor become more and more appealing due to the formation of a favorable and stable morphology. Unfortunately, a deep understanding of the effect of the assembly behavior caused by the sequence structure of CBCs on the device performance is still missing. Herein, from the aspect of manipulating the sequence length and distribution regularity of CBCs, we synthesized a series of new CBCs, namely D18(20)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT and D18(60)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by two&#8208;pot polymerization, and D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT(r) by traditional one&#8208;pot method. It is observed that precise manipulation of sequence length and distribution regularity of the polymer blocks fine&#8208;tunes the self&#8208;assembly of the CBCs, optimizes film morphology, improves optoelectronic properties, and reduces energy loss, leading to simultaneously improved efficiency and stability. Among these CBCs, the D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device achieves a high efficiency of 13.4&#8201;% with enhanced stability, which is an outstanding performance among SCOSCs. Importantly, the regular sequence distribution and suitable sequence length of the CBCs enable a facile film&#8208;forming process of the printed device. For the first time, the blade&#8208;coated large&#8208;area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;%/10.73&#8201;%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.

         <title>Biselenophene Imide: Enabling Polymer Acceptor with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel distannylated electron&#8208;deficient monomer with high purity and reactivity was synthesized, which enables access to acceptor&#8208;acceptor type polymer acceptor PY5&#8208;BSeI with high molecular weight, planar backbone, narrow band gap, and low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO levels. The polymer shows a high electron mobility and very promising efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
The shortage of narrow band gap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8211;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower band gap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83&#8201;%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70&#8201;%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers an excellent approach to developing A&#8211;A type polymers for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Structures of Iron Clusters through Orbital Rehybridization by Adjacent Single Copper Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Combined density functional theory calculation and experimental analysis demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent Cu&#8722;N4 single atoms could regulate the d orbitals of Fe clusters through rehybridization to improve the release of *OH intermediates, thus achieving excellent oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structure&#8208;property correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M)&#8722;N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well&#8208;screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu&#8722;N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O&#8722;O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8722;N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;eV in alkali and 0.80&#8197;eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly&#8208;metallic centers for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Bulk Passivation Enables Hundredfold&#8208;Enhanced Electroluminescence of Monophosphine Cu4I4 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode based on a monodentate&#8208;ligand&#8208;based Cu4I4 cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 104&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulk passivation effect of the active host matrix through non&#8208;covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions. This markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100&#8208;fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.







Abstract
Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large&#8208;scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand&#8208;based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu4I4 cube named [TMeOPP]4Cu4I4. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host&#8208;cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton&#8208;confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap&#8208;state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7&#8208;fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 104 nits, which is &#8776;100&#8208;fold that of the non&#8208;doped analogue.

Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap-state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state-of-the-art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7-fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; nits, which is &#8776;100-fold that of the non-doped analogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible coordination networks exhibit crossover sorption with change in affinity and uptake capacity on varying the temperature. The coordination networks show reverse affinity and uptake capacity for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4. This phenomenon was verified by both sorption isotherm and isobar measurements at different temperature ranges. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations were used to elucidate the mechanisms.







Abstract
Porous sorbents are materials that are used for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, in this study, we report a rare example of &#8220;crossover sorption,&#8221; in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs), [Zn2(L1)(L2)2]n (PCP&#8208;1) and [Zn2(L1)(L3)2]n (PCP&#8208;2) (L1= 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, L2=5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene, and L3=5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4, in which the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis to reveal the guest inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 for C2H2, CO2, C2H6, and C2H4 gases at various temperatures. Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (sc&#8208;sc) transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest binding positions, nature of host&#8211;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions, and their phase transformations upon exposure to these gases. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction compared to the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 nanocluster without lattice variation. DFT calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a &#8776;1&#8197;nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT=S&#8208;c&#8722;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58&#8197;&#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.

         <title>An Encodable Scaffold for Sequence&#8208;Specific Recognition of Duplex RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recognition of nucleic acids by designed ligands has been a long&#8208;term objective due to the biological potential of these ligands. The significant goal of developing small molecule and protein motifs that target duplex DNA has been met but a recognition code for duplex RNA remains in infancy. We show that naturally occurring DNA&#8208;binding helix fork motifs, which do not target equivalent duplex RNA sequences, can be engineered to recognize RNA.







Abstract
RNA, unlike DNA, folds into a multitude of secondary and tertiary structures. This structural diversity has impeded the development of ligands that can sequence&#8208;specifically target this biomolecule. We sought to develop ligands for double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which are ubiquitous in RNA tertiary structure. The major groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA is sequence&#8208;specifically recognized by a range of dimeric helical transcription factors, including the basic leucine zippers (bZIP) and basic helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (bHLH) proteins; however, such simple structural motifs are not prevalent in RNA&#8208;binding proteins. We interrogated the high&#8208;resolution structures of DNA and RNA to identify requirements for a helix fork motif to occupy dsRNA major grooves akin to dsDNA. Our analysis suggested that the rigidity and angle of approach of dimeric helices in bZIP/bHLH motifs are not ideal for the binding of dsRNA major grooves. This investigation revealed that the replacement of the leucine zipper motifs in bHLH proteins with synthetic crosslinkers would allow recognition of dsRNA. We show that a model bHLH DNA&#8208;binding motif does not bind dsRNA but can be reengineered as an RNA ligand. Based on this hypothesis, we rationally designed a miniature synthetic crosslinked helix fork (CHF) as a generalizable proteomimetic scaffold for targeting dsRNA. We evaluated several CHF constructs against a set of RNA and DNA hairpins to probe the specificity of the designed construct. Our studies reveal a new class of proteomimetics as an encodable platform for sequence&#8208;specific recognition of dsRNA.

         <title>High Valence State Sites as Favorable Reductive Centers for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high valence Co3+ sites in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid catalyst can serve as the active site to drive a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction at high current densities. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for producing sustainable and clean hydrogen. Typically, high valence state sites are favorable for oxidation evolution reaction (OER), while low valence states can facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, here we proposed a high valence state of Co3+ in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid as the favorable center for efficient and stable HER, while structural analogues with low chemical states showed much worse performance. As a result, the Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx catalyst could drive alkaline HER with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 22&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 175&#8197;mV for 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the industrial temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, with an excellent stability over 300&#8197;h. Moreover, this material could work for both OER and HER, with a low cell voltage being 1.730&#8197;V to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting at 60&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) clearly identified the high valence Co3+ sites, while in situ XAS during HER and theoretical calculations revealed the favorable electron capture at Co3+ and suitable H adsorption/desorption energy around Co3+, which could accelerate the HER. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8722;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. Owing to the enriched vacancies of nickel selenide supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst with Pt&#8722;Se electron bridges, it exhibits an outstanding HER catalytic performance, which is ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer property, optimized water&#8208;dissociation ability and reduced reaction energy barrier.







Abstract
Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by nickel selenide with rich vacancies was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well distributed at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading amount of 3.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to form Pt&#8722;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. This novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120&#8197;h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide supported Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 80&#8197;h with a retention of 99&#8201;%. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance of porous organic polymers tunes the relative position of TFSI&#8722; anions and catalytic sites, which affects the electron transfer ability, resulting in different LiF contents in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) of Li&#8208;ion batteries. The LiF&#8208;rich SEI formed under the steric hindrance influence of a single methyl group enhances the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8722; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8722; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8722; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel SPD&#8208;NH2 organocatalyst that works cooperatively with a PdII complex to catalyze the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation. It demonstrates great reactivity, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, bridged or fused bicyclic systems can be conveniently transformed into diverse di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetracyclic scaffolds for further conversion into biologically important compounds.







Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and PdII complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8722;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the PdII complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.

The ultrahigh S&#8208;content additive, methylene methyl disulfonate, is preferentially oxidized via the strong interaction with PF6&#8722; anions. This forms the sulfur&#8208;rich interphase and broadens the oxidation stability of electrolyte, thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cells.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an additive with ultrahigh S&#8208;content (34.04&#8201;%, methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8722; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, facilitating the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6&#8197;V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99&#8201;% even after 800&#8197;cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>An In Situ Investigation of the Protein Corona Formation Kinetics of Single Nanomedicine Carriers by Self&#8208;Regulated Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy is designed to investigate protein corona formation kinetics of single nanomedicine carriers in situ. The nanoparticles with negative charges spontaneously enhance their local ECL intensity, and the enhancement degree is influenced by the formed protein corona. With the high spatiotemporal resolution of ECL microscopy, the protein corona formation process is monitored in situ and information of protein corona formation kinetics is obtained.







Abstract
Protein coronas are present extensively at the bio&#8208;nano interface due to the natural adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials in biological fluids. Aside from the robust property of nanoparticles, the dynamics of the protein corona shell largely define their chemical identity by altering interface properties. However, the soft coronas are normally complex and rapidly changing. To real&#8208;time monitor the entire formation, we report here a self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the interaction of the Ru(bpy)33+ with the nanoparticle surface. Thus, the heterogeneity of the protein corona is in situ observed in single nanoparticle &#8220;cores&#8221; before and after loading drugs in nanomedicine carriers. The label&#8208;free, optical stable and dynamic ECL microscopy minimize misinterpretations caused by the variation of nanoparticle size and polydispersity. Accordingly, the synergetic actions of proteins and nanoparticles properties are uncovered by chemically engineered protein corona. After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the protein corona formation kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)33+ and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio&#8208;nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly and Chiral Induction of Metallo&#8208;Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different hierarchical superstructures were achieved with the addition of different halide ions (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;), which altered the intermolecular interactions between metallo&#8208;cage T and PF6&#8722;. In addition, chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.







Abstract
The precise control over hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures relying on the elaboration of multiple noncovalent interactions between basic building blocks is both elusive and highly desirable. We herein report a terpyridine&#8208;based metallo&#8208;cage T with a tetrahedral motif and utilized it as an efficient building block for the controlled hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures in response to different halide ions. Initially, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo&#8208;cage T adopted a hexagonal close&#8208;packed structure. By adding Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;, drastically different hierarchical superstructures with highly&#8208;tight hexagonal packing or graphite&#8208;like packing arrangements, respectively, have been achieved. These unusual halide&#8208;ion&#8208;triggered hierarchical structural changes resulted in quite distinct intermolecular channels, which provided new insights into the mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth based on macromolecular construction. In addition, the chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage T can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sp C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo hybridization in MoO3/GDY facilitates the activation of adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl species, which act as the new active sites for rapid and efficient ozone decomposition under high humidity for potential practical application.







Abstract
Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100&#8201;% under high humid condition (75&#8201;% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804;7.1&#8201;%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57&#8197;eV lower than dry conditions).

         <title>Modular Functionalization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Nitrogen Recovery from Fresh Urine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular functionalized MOF&#8208;808 derivatives were deliberately designed and integrated in a newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process targeting fresh urine. Three distinct modification methods were applied for the development of functional MOFs which deliver efficient nitrogen conversion, recovery, detection, and all contributing to high fresh urine nitrogen recovery that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment.







Abstract
Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr).

&lt;p&gt;Modular functionalized MOF-808 derivatives were deliberately designed and integrated in a newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process targeting fresh urine. Three distinct modification methods were applied for the development of functional MOFs which deliver efficient nitrogen conversion, recovery, detection, and all contributing to high fresh urine nitrogen recovery that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr). It can reduce the demand of producing Nr from the energy-extensive Haber-Bosch process and lower the risk of causing eutrophication simultaneously. In this aspect, source-separated fresh urine is an ideal source for nitrogen recovery given its ubiquity and high nitrogen contents. However, current techniques for nitrogen recovery from fresh urine require high energy input and are of low efficiencies because the recovery target, urea, is a challenge to separate. In this work, we developed a novel fresh urine nitrogen recovery treatment process based on modular functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we employed three distinct modification methods to MOF-808 and developed robust functional materials for urea hydrolysis, ammonium adsorption, and ammonia monitoring. By integrating these functional materials into our newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process, we achieved an average of 75&#8201;% total nitrogen reduction and 45&#8201;% nitrogen recovery with a 30-minute treatment of synthetic fresh urine. The nitrogen recovery process developed in this work can serve as a sustainable and efficient nutrient management that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment. This work also provides a new perspective of implementing versatile advanced materials for water and wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed Site&#8208;Selective Csp3&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic amines can undergo Csp3&#8722;H borylation using BBr3. At high temperature in a microwave reactor, the &#945;&#8208;borylation is preferred, whereas the presence of a Lewis base at lower temperature will lead to the &#946;&#8208;borylation selectively. Mechanistic studies support the presence of an enamine intermediate for both processes.







Abstract
The borylation of Csp3&#8722;H bonds is a challenging transformation that is typically restricted to transition metal catalysis. Herein, we report the site&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free Csp3&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines. It is possible to selectively borylate piperidine derivatives at the &#945; or &#946; positions according to the reaction conditions. The mechanism was supported by NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations. It suggests that the piperidine is dehydrogenated by complexation with BBr3 to produce an enamine intermediate, which is in turn borylated at either the &#945; or &#946; position according to the reaction conditions.

The first nonlinear optically active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), which feature unique quadruple bidentate&#8208;ligand [Hg(NO3)4] modules, exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation responses, together with sufficient birefringences and short ultraviolet cutoff edges.







Abstract
The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=(KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for UV NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of elevated de&#8208;solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co&#8208;solvent to reduce H2O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&#8722; into the electrolyte. An I&#8722; ion&#8208;rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS2@SS full cell cycles for 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8722; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 1600&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Polymer Chainmail: Steric Hindrance and Charge Compensation of Anion&#8208;Doped PEDOT to Boost Stress Deformation of Compressible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

After the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films known as &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; were modified by PF&#8722;6 anion doping, the ion adsorption and diffusion processes on the PEDOT chains were significantly optimized due to the steric hindrance and charge compensation effects, so the cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% after 20,000 cycles) and rate performance (retaining 81.1&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3) were improved.







Abstract
Conducting polymers with high theoretical capacitance and deformability are among the optimal candidates for compressible supercapacitor electrode materials. However, achieving both mechanical and electrochemical stabilities in a single electrode remains a great challenge. To address this issue, the &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; is proposed with reversible deformation capability and enhances stability because of the steric hindrance and charge compensation effect of doped anions. As a proof of concept, four common anions are selected as dopants for Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their effects on the adsorption and diffusion of H+ on PEDOT are verified using density functional theory calculations. Owing to the film formation effect, the 
 doped PEDOT/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon foam exhibits good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and stability due to suitable anion doping. This finding provides new insights into the preparation of electrochemically stable conductive polymer&#8208;based compressible electrode materials.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Regulate Silver&#8208;Copper Bimetallic Oxide Nanowires for Highly Selective Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the surface of Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires are conducive to formation of a Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu adsorption configuration, which facilitates further protonation of a CO* intermediate. The active site promotes CO2 photoreduction to CH4 with improved selectivity to hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Highly selective photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is of great importance to achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Precisely manipulating the formation of the Metal1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal2 (M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2) intermediate on the photocatalyst interface is the most critical step for regulating selectivity, while still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by the polar electronic structure feature of CO2 molecule, we propose a strategy whereby the Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites confined in a bimetallic catalyst surface are conducive to forming a M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate precisely, which can promote selectivity to hydrocarbon formation. Employing the Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires with abundant Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100&#8201;% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 has been achieved. Subsequent surface&#8208;quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO2 photocatalyst, which was designed on the basis of a newly proposed theory for precise regulation of reaction intermediates. Our findings will stimulate further research on dual&#8208;site catalyst design for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag1812+ Cluster with Excitation&#8208;Intensity&#8208;Dependent Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

A DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag1812+ cluster displays dual emission which can be used to create a ratiometric light intensity meter.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are easily tunable emitters with intriguing photophysical properties. Here, a DNA&#8208;AgNC with dual emission in the red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions is presented. Mass spectrometry data showed that two DNA strands stabilize 18 silver atoms with a nanocluster charge of 12+. Besides determining the composition and charge of DNA2[Ag18]12+, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved methods were applied to characterize the picosecond red fluorescence and the relatively intense microsecond&#8208;lived NIR luminescence. During this process, the luminescence&#8208;to&#8208;fluorescence ratio was found to be excitation&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent. This peculiar feature is very rare for molecular emitters and allows the use of DNA2[Ag18]12+ as a nanoscale excitation intensity probe. For this purpose, calibration curves were constructed using three different approaches based either on steady&#8208;state or time&#8208;resolved emission measurements. The results showed that processes like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or photon upconversion through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) could be excluded for DNA2[Ag18]12+. We, therefore, speculate that the ratiometric excitation intensity response could be the result of optically activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;Off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique water transport mechanism is investigated in the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UTSA&#8208;280. An incoming water molecule can replace a coordinated molecule, referred to as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. UTSA&#8208;280 has 1D channels but the knock&#8208;off transport enables water diffusion along the other two dimensions, mimicking a pseudo&#8208;3D mass transfer. As a result, the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane has a high diffusion selectivity of water over ethanol.







Abstract
Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a high water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.

A new group of hybrid antimony halide microstructures are fabricated through a rapid liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, which exhibit ultralow&#8208;loss 1D and 2D optical waveguides through balancing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and orange room temperature phosphorescence (RTP).







Abstract
Harnessing the potential of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is crucial for developing light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, and many others. However, effective strategies in this domain are still relatively scarce. This study presents a new approach to achieving highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF (with a PLQY of 25&#8201;%) and low&#8208;energy orange RTP (with a PLQY of 90&#8201;%) through the fabrication of lead&#8208;free hybrid halides. This new class of monomeric and dimeric 0D antimony halides can be facilely synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up solution process, requiring only a few seconds to minutes, which offer exceptional stability and nontoxicity. By leveraging the highly adaptable molecular arrangement and crystal packing modes, the hybrid antimony halides demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into regular 1D microrod and 2D microplate morphologies. This self&#8208;assembly is facilitated by multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the inorganic cores and organic shells. Notably, these microstructures exhibit outstanding polarized luminescence and function as low&#8208;dimensional optical waveguides with remarkably low optical&#8208;loss coefficients. Therefore, this work not only presents a pioneering demonstration of deep&#8208;blue TADF in hybrid antimony halides, but also introduces 1D and 2D micro/nanostructures that hold promising potential for applications in white LEDs and low&#8208;dimensional photonic systems.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Compatible Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactor for in Situ H2&#8208;Driven NAD(P)H Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell nanoreactor was constructed for the manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis. The nanoreactor enabled not only the efficient H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration via the activated hydrogen species relay between metal nanoparticle and metal complex but also the compatibility of the metal catalysts and enzyme for chemoenzymatic cascade reduction.







Abstract
The regeneration of the reduced form cofactor NAD(P)H is essential for the extra&#8208;cellular application of bio&#8208;reduction, which necessitates not only the development of efficient artificial NAD(P)H regeneration catalytic system but also its well compatibility with the cascade enzymatic reduction system. In this work, we reported the preparation of a metal nanoparticle (NP) and metal complex integrated core&#8208;shell nanoreactor for H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration through the immobilization of a Rh complex on Ni/TiO2 surface via a bipyridine contained 3D porous organic polymer (POP). In comparison with the corresponding single component metal NPs and the immobilized Rh complex, the integrated catalyst presented simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity in NAD(P)H regeneration thanks to the rapid spillover of activated H species from metal NPs to Rh complex. In addition, the size&#8208;sieving effect of POP precluded the direct interaction of enzyme and Rh complex confined in the pores, enabling the success coupling of core&#8208;shell nanoreactor and aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) for chemoenzymatic reduction of acetophenone to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol. This work provides a strategy for the rational manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis.

         <title>Hybrid Sub&#8208;1&#8201;nm Nanosheets of Co&#8208;assembled MnZnCuOx and Polyoxometalate Clusters as Anodes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets anode co&#8208;assembled by MnZnCuOx (MZC) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was successfully constructed via introducing PMA clusters into MZC and precisely controlling the amount of PMA. The non&#8208;covalent interactions endowed the nanosheets with excellent structural stability, while the electron&#8208;rich properties of PMA greatly increased Li+ adsorption energy, thus exhibiting outstanding lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) usually suffer from serious volume expansion leading to the pulverization of structures, further giving rise to lower specific capacity and worse cycling stability. Herein, by introducing polyoxometalate (POM) clusters into TMOs and precisely controlling the amount of POMs, the MnZnCuOx&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (MZC&#8208;PMA HSNSs) anode is successfully fabricated, where the special electron rich structure of POMs is conducive to accelerating the migration of lithium ions on the anode to obtain higher specific capacity, and the non&#8208;covalent interactions between POMs and TMOs make the HSNSs possess excellent structural and chemical stability, thus exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance in LIBs, achieving a high reversible capacity (1157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an admirable long&#8208;term cycling stability at low and high current densities.

Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) experiments on a thin&#8208;film Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag high&#8208;entropy alloy materials&#8208;library (HEA&#8208;ML) reveal that the potential of zero charge (PZC) of different compositions of the Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag HEA has a linear correlation with its composition&#8208;weighted average of the work function, and positively correlates with its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in acidic media.







Abstract
The vast possibilities in the elemental combinations of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) make it essential to discover activity descriptors for establishing rational electrocatalyst design principles. Despite the increasing attention on the potential of zero charge (PZC) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, neither the PZC of HEAs nor the impact of the PZC on the HER activity at HEAs has been described. Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to determine the PZC and the HER activities of various elemental compositions of a Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag thin&#8208;film HEA materials library (HEA&#8208;ML) with high statistical reliability. Interestingly, the PZC of Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag is linearly correlated with its composition&#8208;weighted average work function. The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.

         <title>Low&#8208;cost and Non&#8208;flammable Eutectic Electrolytes for Advanced Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and non&#8208;flammable eutectic electrolytes are reported, which not only cost less than 1/200 of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes, but also show evident universality in various polyhydric alcohol solvents. Moreover, these eutectic electrolytes greatly expand the range of eutectic electrolytes available for advanced battery design.







Abstract
As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl2/Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely proposed in advanced Zn&#8208;I2 batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new&#8208;type ZnSO4&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost&#8208;effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn2+ solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non&#8208;flammability and low price that is &lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I2 cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn&#8208;I2 cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, super&#8208;high&#8208;capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.

&lt;p&gt;Low-cost and non-flammable eutectic electrolytes are reported, which not only cost less than 1/200 of Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based eutectic electrolytes, but also show evident universality in various polyhydric alcohol solvents. Moreover, these eutectic electrolytes greatly expand the range of eutectic electrolytes available for advanced battery design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been widely proposed in advanced Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new-type ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost-effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol-based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non-flammability and low price that is &amp;lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, super-high-capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Approach to Diverse Coral Diterpenes from a Biosynthetic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic biology enables the semisynthesis of numerous complex chemotypes starting from the soft coral metabolite klysimplexin R produced at gram scale. This approach has the potential to provide diverse molecules for drug discovery and development using a green approach inspired by nature.







Abstract
Thousands of coral terpenes originate from simple scaffolds that undergo oxidative tailoring. While corals are excellent sources of drug leads, the challenge of supplying structurally complex drug leads from marine organisms has sometimes slowed their development. Making this even more challenging, in comparison to other organisms, such as plants and microbes, for which the terpene literature is substantial, very little is known about how the unique coral terpenes are biosynthesized and elaborated in nature. In this study, we used a semisynthetic strategy to produce at gram scale in yeast the eunicellane scaffold that underlies &gt;200 coral compounds. Synthetic oxidation reactions were explored, generating key scaffolds that reflect three of the four structural classes derived from eunicellane and enabling the first asymmetric syntheses of the natural products solenopodin C and klysimplexin Q. Biomimetic methods and detailed mechanistic studies of synthetic reactions shed light on potential enzymological reactivity, including the role of epoxide rearrangement in eunicellane biosynthesis.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Highly Selective Separation of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel two&#8208;dimensional ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), denoted as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88, is synthesized utilizing the organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine. Once activated, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 demonstrates a notable selectivity for CO2 over C2H2 with an IAST selectivity index of 1894.







Abstract
The separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important but challenging task due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. In terms of porous adsorbents for this separation, the CO2&#8208;selective porous materials are superior to the C2H2&#8208;selective ones because of the cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiency but have been rarely achieved. Herein we report our unexpected discovery of the first hydrogen bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from a simple organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (PYTPZ) (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88) as the highly CO2&#8208;selective porous material. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 is a two&#8208;dimensional HOFs with a pore pocket of about 7.6&#8197;&#197;. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 takes up a high amount of CO2 (59.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions with the record IAST selectivity of 1894. Its high performance for the CO2/C2H2 separation has been further confirmed through breakthrough experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and molecular simulations.

Mechanochemistry makes the next move in advancing organometallic synthesis. In their Research Article (e202305775), Riina Aav, Dzmitry G. Kananovich et&#8197;al. report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes the limitations of the classic solvent&#8208;based approach. Mechanochemical activation enables the rapid generation of Grignard reagents in situ, making the process resistant to air and allowing solid Br&#248;nsted acids to be used as additives to improve yields.

Post&#8208;synthetic modifications of helical &#946;&#8208;peptide are achieved by a novel thioether&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC). Foldamers containing ATTC maintain their 12&#8208;helical conformation while offering versatile chemical transformations such as desulfurization, tagging, oxidation, and dimerization. These capabilities are detailed in the Research Article (e202305196) by Yunho Lee, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee et&#8197;al.

Heterogeneous and recyclable ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles of iridium(0) enabled highly selective hydrogenation of distal unsubstituted aromatic rings to generate novel phosphine ligands. The iridium&#8208;hydride species and hydrogen bonding between the substrate and solvent facilitate the catalysis, as reported by Fabrice Gallou, Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307139).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review offers an overview and evaluation of the existing tagging strategies that are used to provide catalysts with improved recycling capabilities. It is focused on approaches that modify the solubility or the molecular weight to retain homogeneous catalysts in a liquid phase, which can be directly recycled. The insight provided should aid the development of more standardized catalyst recycling strategies and tags.







Abstract
The recycling of homogeneous catalysts while keeping them in the homogeneous matrix is an ongoing challenge many reactions face if they are to find industrial applications. While a plethora of different synthetic approaches towards better, recyclable homogeneous catalysts exist, the literature shows a gap when one searches for a concise overview of the different catalyst modifications. This Review is designed to close that gap by summarising the existing synthesis pathways towards polar, non&#8208;polar, fluorous, and molecular&#8208;weight&#8208;enlarged catalysts and by examining their respective synthesis routes with a focus on modular and late&#8208;stage approaches. Furthermore, we map out the potential for a generally applicable tag library that allows straightforward catalyst modifications to tune them for each desired recycling strategy.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release surmounts numerous limitations inherent in traditional light&#8208;controlled drug release and radiochemotherapy. However, further enhancements are required in areas such as drug carrier design, advancements in radiation chemistry, and X&#8208;ray dosage control. Therefore, this article aims to explore X&#8208;rays as a stimulus for controlled drug release in DDSs development, the mechanisms of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release, and its future prospects.







Abstract
Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.

Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer character and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and the related OLEDs are also discussed.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy is devised to enhance the neutral water oxidation. The concerted promotion of electron transfer via the IrOx/NiOOH interface and proton transfer via the near&#8208;surface ion environment synergistically accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer events. The expedited kinetics enabled the direct detection of oxygen intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment that originated from hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Due to the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8722;O and Ir&#8722;OO&#8722; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8722;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.

         <dc:description>
A general approach to 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitriles was developed. The mechanism, scope, and scalability of this transformation were studied. The core was incorporated into the structure of the antihistamine drug Rupatidine instead of the pyridine ring, which led to a dramatic improvement in physicochemical properties.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework birefringent crystal exhibits strikingly large birefringence of exp. 0.60@550&#8197;nm. This attribute would enable it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.

         <title>Centimeter&#8208;Size Single Crystals of Halide Perovskite Photoferroelectric Solid Solution with Ultrahigh Pyroelectricity Boosted Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution demonstrates optoelectrical properties and a Curie temperature tunable over a wide range. When the component ratio is x=0.7, the bulk solid solution single crystal demonstrates an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric coefficient, which facilitates self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetection with boosted responsivity and detectivity over 1300&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoferroelectrics, especially emerging halide perovskite ferroelectrics, have motivated tremendous interests owing to their fascinating bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and cross&#8208;coupled functionalities. However, solid solutions of halide perovskite photoferroelectrics with controllable structure and enhanced performance are scarcely explored. Herein, through mixing cage cation, a homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution (PA, FA and MA are CH3CH2CH2NH3+, NH2CHNH2+ and CH3NH3+, 0&#8804;x&#8804;1) has been developed, which demonstrates tunable Curie temperature in a wide range of 263&#8211;323&#8197;K and excellent optoelectrical features. As the component adjusted to x=0.7, the bulk crystal demonstrates ultrahigh pyroelectric coefficient up to 1.48&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 around room temperature. Strikingly, benefiting from the light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity and remarkable BPVE, a self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetector based solid solution crystals with boosted responsivity and detectivity over than 1300&#8201;% has been achieved. This pioneering work sheds light on the exploration of photoferroelectric solid solutions towards high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. A new protocol, starting from aryldiazonium salts, that uses ball milling and piezoelectric materials as redox catalysts is described. This process addresses the limitations of the Balz&#8211;Schiemann procedure, which is currently used in industry. In addition, the mechanism of this fluorination reaction is also investigated.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8211;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine and a terminal reductant.

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) is a path toward improved hole mobility and enhanced device properties when used in solar cells. Here, we design a porphyrin supramolecule to modulate the surface properties of the commonly used Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTM in perovskite solar cells. Upon doping monoamine FeIII porphyrin into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the porphyrins self&#8208;assemble into oxygen&#8208;bridged dimer&#8208;based supramolecules located at the grain boundaries of the HTM. The doped perovskite devices exhibit an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability.







Abstract
Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine FeIII porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by Unstabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles is described. Synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products were smoothly transformed into highly substituted pyridines. The method tolerates a range of electrophiles and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of CO.







Abstract
This report describes the first example of palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles. The approach involves initiation by an unstabilized enolate nucleophile under an atmospheric pressure of CO and termination with a carbon electrophile. This process is compatible with a diverse range of electrophiles, including aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl iodides to yield synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products, which were demonstrated to be precursors for multi&#8208;substituted pyridines. A PdI&#8208;dimer complex with two bridging CO units was observed although its role in catalysis is not yet understood.

         <title>Self&#8208;quenched Fluorophore Dimers for DNA&#8208;PAINT and STED Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for fluorophore&#8208;labelled DNA oligonucleotides is introduced that relies on short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching of two identical fluorophores. This strategy achieves a reduction in background fluorescence, while at the same time increasing the photon budget two&#8208;fold. These probes can be applied to super&#8208;resolution techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM).







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution techniques like single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy have been extended by the use of non&#8208;covalent, weak affinity&#8208;based transient labelling systems. DNA&#8208;based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi&#8208;target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2&#8208;fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore&#8208;dimer single&#8208;stranded DNA, and show super&#8208;resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit with recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules was designed to establish an artificial intercellular interaction mode between T cells and cancer cells. Based on cancer recognition&#8208;induced receptor aggregation, T cells could be directly stimulated to kill target cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral amides was achieved by an asymmetric Wolff rearrangement. A bifunctional phosphoric acid catalyst not only expedited the transformation but also controlled the enantioselectivity. The developed method enables the asymmetric addition between potent nucleophilic reagents and ketene species and provides a new approach to chiral amides.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton&#8208;transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.







Abstract
Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3&#8201;Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3&#8201;Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.

These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first flex&#8208;activated fluorogenic mechanophore (FA) is presented. Its retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction, resulting in the release of anthracenes with turn&#8208;on fluorescence, is achieved through compression of FA&#8208;crosslinked networks or hydrostatic high pressure applied to FA crystals and its polymers. The structural and functional diversity of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores as sensitive and unconventional optical force probes is enriched.







Abstract
Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO4 photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeOx cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.







Abstract
Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25&#8197;cm2), demonstrating the advantage of MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective formation of isoquinoline heterocycles by a PIII/PV=O redox organocatalyzed Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction is described. With N2 release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, the method permits the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomeric isoquinolines under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. and 93&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of isoquinoline heterocycles thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provides access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.

         <title>Capture of Singlet Oxygen Modulates Host&#8208;Guest Behavior of Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of anthracene&#8208;based tetrahedral capsules have been shown to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The cage cycloadducts were found to bind an array of guest molecules more weakly than their precursor cages, offering a novel method for stimuli&#8208;driven guest uptake and release.







Abstract
The anthracene panels of two tetrahedral MII4L6 cages, where MII=CoII or FeII, were found to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen (1O2) in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. ESI&#8208;MS analysis showed the cobalt(II) cages to undergo complete transformation of all anthracene panels into endoperoxides, whereas the iron(II) congeners underwent incomplete conversion. The reaction was found to be partially reversible in the case of the 1&#8208;FeII cage. The dioxygen&#8208;cage cycloadducts were found to bind a set of guest molecules more weakly than the parent cages, with affinity dropping by more than two orders of magnitude in some cases. The light&#8208;driven cycloaddition reaction between cage and 1O2 thus served as a stimulus for guest release and reuptake.

&#8220;My group has fun by gathering for cake to celebrate birthdays, publications, and milestones (a tradition we adopted from the Chirik group, where I did my PhD). Besides being a very creative group of scientists, my students&#8217; baking skills are also impressive! I am the only one who must go to a bakery when it is my turn to bring a cake &#8230; My favorite saying is &#8220;When one teaches, two learn.&#8221; &#8230;&#8221; Find out more about M&#225;t&#233; J. Bezdek in his Introducing &#8230; Profile.
