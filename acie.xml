         <title>Site&#8208;selective construction of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through photoredox  catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Critical View on the Use of DNA Hydrogels in Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous studies have reported in the past that the use of protein&#8208;encoding DNA hydrogels as templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) leads to better yields than the use of conventional templates such as plasmids or PCR fragments. Systematic investigation of different types of bulk materials from pure DNA hydrogels and DNA hydrogel composites using a commercially available CFPS kit showed no evidence of improved expression efficiency. However, protein&#8208;coding DNA hydrogels were advantageously used in microfluidic reactors as immobilized templates for repetitive protein production, suggesting that DNA&#8208;based materials offer potential for future developments in high&#8208;throughput profiling or rapid in situ characterization of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Inducible Radiomimetic Photosensitizers Selectively Suppress Cancer Cell Proliferation by Damaging DNA through Radical Cation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;inducible radiomimetic photosensitizers have been developed to damage DNA through radical cation chemistry. They exhibit selective and redox&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and demonstrate significant potential in combination therapy. This innovative approach not only provides an alternative strategy for phototherapy but also establishes a novel cellular platform for studying the direct effects of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy leverages ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells through direct and indirect effects, and direct effects are considered to play an equal or greater role. Several photosensitizers have been developed to mimic the direct effects of radiotherapy, generating radical cations in DNA models, but none has been applied in cellular studies. Here, we design a radiomimetic photosensitizer, producing DNA radical cations in cells for the first time. To reduce adverse effects, several redox&#8208;inducible precursors are prepared as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH and H2O2. These precursors respond to GSH or H2O2, releasing the active photosensitizer that captures DNA abasic (AP) sites and generates DNA radical cations upon photolysis, without disrupting the redox state of cells. DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H2O and O2 to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High&#8208;Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with multiple catalytic active sites can generate various reactive oxygen species, deplete glutathione, and block glutathione regeneration by consuming NADPH, thereby triggering oxidative stress cascade amplification for collaborative catalytic therapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect is further enhanced when synergized with photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single&#8208;atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual&#8208;atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme&#8208;like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II bio&#8208;window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high&#8208;efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy. This work will advance the therapeutic applications of DAzymes and provide valuable insights for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Initiated Nano&#8208;Micelles Mediated Covalent Modification of mRNA for Labeling and Treatment of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving in situ spontaneous and precise mRNA covalent modification can effectively interfere with the translation of mRNA in tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. The linked Luminol and Ce6 generated 1O2 in situ by CRET and furan&#8208;mediated covalent modification of mRNAs was triggered for RNA interference in situ. This strategy offers novel insights into in situ RNA interference.







Abstract
As a promising gene therapy strategy, controllable small molecule&#8208;mRNA covalent modification in tumor cells could be initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) to complete the modification process. However, in vivo generation of 1O2 is usually dependent on excitation of external light, and the limited light penetration of tissues greatly interferes the development of deep tumor photo therapy. Here, we constructed a tumor&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;micelle for the spontaneous intracellular generation of 1O2 without the need for external light, and inducing a high level of covalent modification of mRNA in tumor cells. Luminol and Ce6 were chemically bonded to produce 1O2 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) triggered by high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The sufficient 1O2 oxidized the loaded furan to highly reactive dicarbonyl moiety, which underwent cycloaddition reaction with adenine (A), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) on the mRNA for interfering with the tumor cell protein expression, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this self&#8208;initiated gene therapy nano&#8208;micelle could induce covalent modification of mRNA by 1O2 without external light, and the process could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging, which provided an effective strategy for RNA&#8208;based tumor gene therapy.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical Mediated Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Oxidation over Covalent Triazine/Heptazine&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Baeyer&#8208;Villiger&#160; oxidation of ketones to the corresponding lactones/esters is a classic and essential reaction in the chemical industry. However, this oxidation process has not yet been achieved in ambient conditions with the aid of oxygen and heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this study, we developed an organic photocatalytic system using covalent triazine/heptazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTF&#8208;TB/CHF&#8208;TB) to enable the B&#8208;V oxidation reaction under mild conditions through a cascade reaction pathway. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can "chelate&#8221; and decompose the in situ generated H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Compared to conventional methods that primarily involve metal&#8208;activated benzaldehyde at elevated temperatures (e.g., 60 oC), the &#8226;OH generated in our study can readily cleave the C&#8208;H bond of benzaldehyde, forming an active intermediate that drives subsequent sequential processes: O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;Ph&#8208;CO&#8226;&#8594;Ph&#8208;COOO&#8226;. By employing this photocatalytic process, a yield of 91% and a selectivity of over 99&#8201;% were obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexanone to caprolactone at room temperature. This performance is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, and our CHF&#8208;TB catalyst demonstrates impressive reusability, maintaining a high yield after 5 consecutive runs. This work presents a straightforward approach for C&#8208;H cleavage by organocatalysts to produce &#949;&#8208;caprolactone in a mild manner by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Confined Active Silver Nanoclusters with Ultrawide Operating Temperature Window in CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal nanoclusters are often highly active in many catalytic reactions but less stable particularly under harsh reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate that this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off can be efficiently broken through rational design of surrounding microenvironment of the supported nanocatalyst including gas adsorbate overlayer and underneath support surface chemistry. Our studies reveal that chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag surface and surface hydroxyl groups on oxide support, which are dynamically consumed during reaction but sustained by reaction environment (O2 and H2O vapor), drive spontaneous redispersion of Ag particles and stabilization of highly active Ag nanoclusters. Such a dynamic confinement effect from gas&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support interaction enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit complete catalytic oxidation of CO over a wide temperature window of 25 &#8208; 500 &#176;C under dry conditions and 200 &#8208; 800 &#176;C under wet conditions as well as remarkable stability at 300 &#176;C over 1000 h.</dc:description>

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Imidazolate&#8208;Stabilized Cu(III): Dioxygen to Oxides at Type 3 Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins and enzymes, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to a highly oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes with exclusive monodentate imidazole ligation, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate&#8208;ligated bis(&#956;2&#8208;oxido)dicopper(III) species. Formal two&#8208;electron oxidation to Cu(III) remains unprecedented in biological systems, yet is effected readily by addition of base in these model systems. Spectrophotometric titrations by UV/visible/near&#8208;IR and copper K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies are interpreted most simply as two cooperative, 2H+ transformations in which the peroxide O&#8208;O is cleaved in the first step. Elaboration from simple imidazoles to a protected histidine extends this isomerization into an amino acid environment. The role of phenolate as a base suggests this four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 is energetically viable in a biological context and requires only two copper centers, which act as two&#8208;electron shuttles when imidazole deprotonation assists. This existential precedent of viable imidazolate intermediates invites speculation into an alternative mechanism for phenol hydroxylation not previously considered at Type 3 copper sites such a tyrosinases.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P&#8208;type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution&#8208;processed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n&#8208;type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications. Herein, we developed an alcohol&#8208;processable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting polymer, poly(3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione): poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PBFDO:PEOx), which utilizes electrostatic interactions between PEOx and PBFDO to simultaneously achieve high conductivity and alcohol&#8208;processability. The PBFDO:PEOx films exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250 &#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent&#8208;processed n&#8208;type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p&#8208;type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO:PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Reconfiguration by Cation/Anion Cross&#8208;coordination for   Highly Reversible and Facile Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8208;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6%, desirable rate capability under 25 &#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1 C under &#8722;20 &#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3% and a 15% increment of energy density under 25 &#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Nanocomposite Polymer&#8208;integrated Ca&#8208;doped CeO2
Electrolyte for Robust and High&#8208;rate All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Due to the seamless interfaces between solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and electrode materials, SPEs&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSSIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems. However, the sluggish Na+ transport and uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation still hinder the practical application of SPEs&#8208;based ASSSIBs. Herein, Ca&#8208;doped CeO2 (Ca&#8208;CeO2) nanotube framework is synthesized and integrated with poly (ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate&#8208;perfluoropolyether copolymer (PEOA&#8208;PFPE), resulting in multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (namely SNEs, i.e., PEOA&#8208;PFPE/Ca&#8208;CeO2). Our investigations demonstrate that the fluorous effect incurred by the fluorine&#8208;containing PEOA&#8208;PFPE and the oxygen vacancy effect induced by the Ca&#8208;CeO2 framework could synergistically promote the dissociation of sodium salt, ultimately enhancing the Na+ mobility in SNEs. Besides, the resultant SNEs construct rapid Na+ transport channels and homogenize the Na deposition in SNEs/Na interface, which effectively prevents the Na dendrite growth. Furthermore, the assembled carbon&#8208;coated sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP@C)||PEOA&#8208;PFPE/Ca&#8208;CeO2||Na coin cell delivers impressive rate capability of 97.9 mA h g&#8208;1 at 2 C and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 84.3% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This work illustrates that constructing multifunctional SNEs via incorporating functional inorganic frameworks into fluorine&#8208;containing SPEs could be a promising strategy for the commercialization of robust and high&#8208;performance ASSSIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthen Water O&#8208;H Bond in Electrolytes for Enhanced Reversibility and Safety in Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries present a promising prospect for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to the abundance, inherent safety, and the high theoretical capacity of aluminum. However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in&#8208;depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water&#8208;poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O&#8208;mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335 mAh g&#8208;1 while retaining 71% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.</dc:description>

However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in-depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water-poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O-mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de-solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335 mAh g-1 while retaining 71% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Supramolecular Network Enabled Gentle Reprogramming of Liquid Crystal Elastomer toward Evolutionary Robot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, many organisms augment chances of survival by reprogramming their structures to evolving environment, among which sea squirts being a prime example. Such reprogramming has been demonstrated in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuator assembled with heat assistance. However, the required temperature being higher than the actuation temperature limits its application. Here, we reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network LCE to construct soft modular and reprogrammable actuator by assembling with a gentle heat treatment. Leveraging the Michael addition reaction, we introduced hydrogen bonding to the LCE matrix with functionalized pyridine monomers. Experimental and molecular dynamics modeling proved the efficient dynamic hydrogen bond exchange at 60&#176;C, significantly lower than the actuating temperature of the LCE. This gave rise to the reversible and robust adhesion of the same collection of LCE modules capable of being built into different bilayers and performing various morphing upon a short thermal stimulation. Therefore, we demonstrated that these comparatively weak cross&#8208;links enabled reconfiguration of the LCE actuator. With the developed hydrogen&#8208;bonding LCEs, we built proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept modular reprogrammable robot, performing crawling, sailing, and microcircuit repair tasks. This bioinspired and efficient method for evolutionary LCE robot offers a viable path for further development of intelligent actuators sustainable in complex environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals by Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation in Heavy and Super&#8208;Heavy Water</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the detailed proton&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.







Abstract
Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail.

     alt="Proton-Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported the detailed proton-driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton-driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water-induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton-induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Six&#8208;Membered Ring Directed Assembly of a Zirconium Zeolitic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new paradigm for zirconium zeolite&#8208;type frameworks through the conversion of extraframework sites in natural zeolite into part of the framework by symmetry&#8208; and size&#8208;matched ring&#8208;directing agent for the size&#8208;exclusion separation of hexane isomers.







Abstract
The synthesis of zirconium MOFs with zeolite net is quite challenging due to the high connectivity of Zr6 clusters, which is far from tetrahedral connection, a requisite for zeolite net. In this work, we demonstrate a six&#8208;membered ring (6MR) strategy through mimicking of mineral zeolites with mixed ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers. With this strategy, the ditopic linker cross&#8208;links Zr6 clusters to form 4&#8208;connected zeolite&#8208;like nets, while the tritopic one is used to direct the formation of 6MR and simultaneously consumes extra coordination sites on the cluster. The feasibility of this strategy is shown by one zeolitic metal&#8211;organic framework (NNM&#8208;5) and this strategy has also led to the synthesis of the other dia&#8208;type zirconium MOF (NNM&#8208;6). Interestingly, as the tritopic linker not only directs the formation of 6MR but also partitions 6MR into small segments, NNM&#8208;5 with SOD topology shows a structural feature of small aperture and big cage, which has led to efficient separation of hexane isomers. With both exceptionally high n&#8208;hexane uptake (65.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and size&#8208;exclusion selectivity, an exceptional separation capability is verified by breakthrough experiments. Calculation results demonstrate that the large difference of diffusion energy barrier due to the small aperture accounts for the underlying separation mechanism.

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;Tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every component counts: the optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) are precisely regulated through simultaneous core unit, aromatic arm, and pendant polar group engineering. Consequently, the TTTA TT&#8722;N&#8722;M emerges as a universal cathode interlayer (CIL) material for highly efficient organic solar cells with record&#8208;breaking thickness tolerance, ranking it among the top CIL materials ever identified.







Abstract
A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8722;N&#8722;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90&#8201;% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95&#8197;nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8722;N&#8722;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60&#8201;% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure&#8208;properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Modulating the Leverage Relationship in Nitrogen Fixation Through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom molecular catalyst with asymmetric O/N coordination forms hydrogen bonds with H2O to regulate proton transfer, simultaneously achieving superior NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, and modulating the leverage relationship between activity and selectivity in nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
In the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a leverage relationship exists between NH3&#8208;producing activity and selectivity because of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which means that high activity with strong protons adsorption causes low product selectivity. Herein, we design a novel metal&#8208;organic hydrogen bonding framework (MOHBF) material to modulate this leverage relationship by a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated proton transfer pathway. The MOHBF material was composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a Ni&#8208;N2O2 molecular catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO). The unique structure of O atoms in Ni&#8208;O&#8208;C and N&#8208;O&#8208;H could form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules to interfere with protons being directly adsorbed onto Ni active sites, thus regulating the proton transfer mechanism and slowing the HER kinetics, thereby modulating the leverage relationship. Moreover, this catalyst has abundant Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom sites enriched with Ni&#8208;N/O coordination, conducive to the adsorption and activation of N2. The Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO exhibits simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity of NH3 production with a maximum NH3 yield rate of 209.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%, outperforming other reported single&#8208;atom NRR catalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photodetection by Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Indium&#8208;Halide with Minimal Structural Distortion and Reduced Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic challenges of 0D hybrid halides are addressed by tetragonal C24H72N8In2Br14, featuring closely spaced [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra linked by anion bridging and vacancies, facilitating a reduced direct band gap with enhanced carrier mobility, enabling visible light photodetection with responsivity of ~10&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, and ~81.2&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 with ~7&#215;109 Jones detectivity in self&#8208;powered mode.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;inspired zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely&#8208;spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible&#8208;light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6&#8208;hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra, and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9&#8197;&#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]&#8722; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6&#8201;% bromine vacancy within the [InBr4]&#8722; block, mid&#8208;gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19&#8197;eV. HIB demonstrates an unprecedently high responsivity of 9975.9&#177;201.6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V potential bias at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, among low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides. In the absence of potential bias, the self&#8208;powered photodetection parameters are 81.2&#177;3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and (6.98&#177;0.21)&#215;109 Jones.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;exchange membrane made from rigid polymers was developed for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. It shows high ion selectivity, suppressing the I2 cathode shuttle effect. Abundant sulfonate groups in the membrane ensure uniform Zn2+ flux on the anode. Additionally, the membrane's microporosity allows pre&#8208;adsorption of active materials, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the battery exhibits high stability and capacity over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8722;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. At 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000&#8197;cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1&#8201;%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high&#8208;loading (35&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two multifunctional additives of AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPMA and AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPEA are developed to suppress the voltage loss of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells of 1.78&#8197;eV and construct highly efficient and durable inverted inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. The formation of AQS&#8208;involved intermediate phase regulate the crystalliztaion rate resulting in lower defects of inorganic perovskites. Moreover, the benchmark of T90 lifetime of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells under MPPT can be promoted to 1000&#8197;h, which will facilitate the real&#8208;world deployment.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Associated Photofluorochromism for Time&#8208;Resolved Information Encryption and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitchable dual&#8208;color fluorescent polymers (VPDFPs) show a reversible switch between green and red fluorescence. Their discoloration rate can be readily modulated by changing the feed conent of a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding UPy monomer, which can greatly improve the security of encrypted information and simplify the decryption process. These VPDFPs were applied in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and time&#8208;resolved information encryption.







Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved photofluorochromism constitutes a powerful approach to enhance information encryption security but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strategy of using hydrogen bonds to regulate the time for initiating photofluorochromism. In our strategy, copolymers containing negative photochromic spiropyran (NSP), naphthalimide, and multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding (UPy) units are designed, which display photo&#8208;switchable fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from naphthalimide donor to the NSP acceptor. Interestingly, the FRET is locked via the dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between ring&#8208;opened NSP and UPy moieties, resulting in time&#8208;dependent fluorescence. The change in fluorescence can be finely regulated via UPy fraction in the polymers. Besides the novel time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, the polymers also take advantage of visible&#8208;light triggerable, excellent photostability, photoreversibility, and processability. We demonstrate that these properties enable them many application opportunities such as fluorescent security labels and multilevel information encryption patterns.

&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-driven photoswitchable dual-color fluorescent polymers (VPDFPs) show a reversible switch between green and red fluorescence. Their discoloration rate can be readily modulated by changing the feed conent of a multiple hydrogen-bonding UPy monomer, which can greatly improve the security of encrypted information and simplify the decryption process. These VPDFPs were applied in advanced anti-counterfeiting and time-resolved information encryption.

         <title>Integrating Molecular Motions in Ternary Cocrystals for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ternary cocrystal composed of tetracyanoquinodimethane as an electron acceptor, triphenylene as an electron acceptor, and pyrene, the latter exhibits rotational motion, resulting in enhanced photothermal ability in the NIR&#8208;II window. The molecular motions are characterized directly by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography. Pyrene also functions as a blocker to protect the organic radical from quenchers such as oxygen and water molecules.







Abstract
Organic photothermal conversion materials hold immense promise for various applications owing to their structural flexibility. Recent research has focused on enhancing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and mitigating radiative transition processes. In this study, we have developed a viable approach to the design of photothermal conversion materials through the construction of ternary organic cocrystals, by introducing a third component as a molecular blocker and motion unit into a binary donor&#8211;acceptor system. Superstructural and photophysical properties of the ternary cocrystals were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The role of the molecular blocker in radical stabilization and photothermal conversion was demonstrated. Intriguingly, the motions of the entire pyrene molecules in the cocrystal have been observed by the results of variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The excellent performance of the ternary cocrystal as a photothermal material was validated through efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiments. The efficiency of water evaporation reached 88.7&#8201;%, with a corresponding evaporation rate of 1.29&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing excellent performance among pure organic small molecular photothermal conversion materials. Our research underscores the introduction of molecular blockers and motion units to stabilize radicals and produce outstanding photothermal conversion materials, offering new pathways for developing efficient and stable photothermal conversion materials.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a non&#8208;local metasurface to achieve vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between surface lattice resonance and the C=O stretching modes of both ethyl acetate and p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). Within this VSC system, we observed a 2.7&#8208;fold increase in the solvolysis reaction of PNPA compared to the bare reaction. This finding highlights the robustness of metasurfaces in catalyzing chemical reactions via VSC.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides With Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 0D hybrid Zn halide family with high water&#8208;resistance and simultaneous integration of cyan STE emission and ultralong green afterglow was firstly synthesized by skillfully manipulating metal halides and organic phosphors as independent optical centers. Through regulating heavy atom effect to control the intersystem crossing rate and spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the dormant emitting units were significantly activated resulting in unprecedented high emission efficiency for both STE and afterglow emissions in 0D hybrid metal halides, which was applied for color&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption&#8208;decryption.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP=benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X=Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8722; effectively enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66&#8201;% and 54.62&#8201;% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94&#8197;ms and 0.308&#8197;&#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.

         <title>The First&#8208;In&#8208;Class Deubiquitinase&#8208;Targeting Chimera Stabilizes and Activates cGAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimeras (DUBTACs) of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immunity pathway, were discovered. These DUBTACs, which not only stabilized cGAS but also activated the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;IRF3 pathway, were generated by exploiting an improved small&#8208;molecule ligand of the deubiquitinase OTUB1. It has also been demonstrated that this improved OTUB1 ligand can lead to highly effective DUBTACs.







Abstract
Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimera (DUBTAC) is a promising technology for inducing targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Despite its therapeutic potential, very few proteins have been stabilized by DUBTACs to date. The limited applicability of this technology is likely due to the modest DUBTAC&#8208;induced protein stabilization effect, and the scarcity of effective deubiquitinase ligands that can be harnessed for DUBTAC development. Here, we report the discovery of MS7829 and MS8588, the first&#8208;in&#8208;class DUBTACs of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. While these DUBTACs are based on a cGAS inhibitor, they effectively stabilized cGAS and activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 signaling. To develop these cGAS DUBTACs, we optimized EN523, an OTUB1 covalent ligand, into an improved ligand, MS5105. We validated MS5105 by generating a MS5105&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC, which was approximately 10&#8208;fold more effective in stabilizing the &#916;F508&#8208;CFTR mutant protein than the previously reported EN523&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC. Overall, this work advances the DUBTAC technology for TPS.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Induced Phase Control Synthesis of Multi&#8208;dimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 Heteronanostructures via Cation Exchange</title>

         <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide induced phase control method for synthesizing multidimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanostructures via cation exchange, which successfually affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of cation exchange reactions. However, the crystal structure of Co3S4 is fail to form from similar cation exchange reactions of Cu1.94S.







Abstract
Phase control over cation exchange (CE) reactions has emerged as an important approach for the synthesis of nanomaterials (NMs), enabling precise determination of their reactivity and properties. Although factors such as crystal structure and morphology have been studied for the phase engineering of CE reactions in NMs, there remains a lack of systematic investigation to reveal the impact for the factors in heterogeneous materials. Herein, we report a molybdenum disulfide induced phase control method for synthesizing multidimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanostructures (HNs) via cation exchange. MoS2 in parent Cu1.94S&#8208;MoS2 HNs are proved to affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of CE reactions, and facilitate the formation of Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs with controlled phase. This MoS2 induced phase control method can be extended to other parent HNs with multiple dimensions, which shows its diversity. Further, theoretical calculations demonstrate that Co3S4 (111)/MoS2 (001) exhibits a higher adhesion work, providing further evidence that MoS2 enables phase control in the HNs CE reactions, inducing the generation of novel Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for crystal phase&#8208; and dimensionality&#8208;dependent of cobalt sulfide based HNs, the obtained Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanoplates (HNPls) show remarkable performance in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) under alkaline media. This synthetic methodology provides a unique design strategy to control the crystal structure and fills the gap in the study of heterogeneous materials on CE reaction over phase engineering that are otherwise inaccessible.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of C&#8208; and Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silacyclopentanes via Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with dihydrosilanes or primary silanes, which gives access to a variety of C&#8208;stereogenic and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in decent yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silacycles have exhibited significant potential for application in the fields of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Accordingly, the development of effective methods for synthesizing these compounds has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with hydrosilanes, that allows the rapid assembly of various enantioenriched carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions. Further stereospecific transformation of the Si&#8722;H bond on the chiral silicon center expands the diversity of these C&#8208; and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds&#8212;Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles via hydroborative cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds is reported. Structurally diverse products, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more were readily obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed an interesting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon, including &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles was studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.

         <title>25.71&#8201;%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by A Thiourea&#8208;based Isomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, thiourea isomer derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB) were developed. It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb2+ through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT&#8208;treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the PSCs, we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818&#8197;eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8722;NH&#8722; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015&#8197;eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% (certified as 24.66&#8201;%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74&#8201;%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05&#8201;%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0&#8201;% and 95.2&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000&#8197;h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Heterochiral &#960;&#8208;Stacking Dimerization of Helical Secondary Structures with Emerging Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific interface mode type was observed between helical secondary structures, in which a left&#8208;handed (M) helix binds specifically to a right&#8208;handed (P) helix along the helical axis, leading to the formation of discrete heterochiral helical dimers. Moreover, a concealed supramolecular chirality within the meso&#8208;supramolecular dimers was unexpectedly discovered by chiral induction, and was further underpinned by covalent meso&#8208;helix structures.

         <title>Sulfate Derivatives with Heteroleptic Tetrahedra: New Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Birefringent Materials in which Weak Interactions Modulate Functional Module Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;ultraviolet birefringent materials in which weak interactions modulate functional module ordering. Following this strategy, new CN4H7SO3CF3 crystals show superior linear optical properties, including the shortest cutoff edge among reported guanidinium/aminoguanidinium&#8208;based compounds and the largest birefringence in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep&#8208;UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high&#8208;performance candidates for deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials. The millimeter&#8208;sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200&#8197;nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546&#8197;nm, 0.395 @ 200&#8197;nm) in the deep&#8208;UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8208;40&#186;C&#160;Sodium Metal&#160;Batteries&#160;by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves,&#160;and promising&#160;low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+&#160;and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application.&#160;Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions; as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinalol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate&#160;Na+&#160;transport kinetics.&#160;The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that&#160;the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces&#160;the desolvation barrier and forms&#160;a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8211;NH&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6&#160;and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) full cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29% at 1 C after&#160;1200 cycles and presents no capacity decay&#160;over 150 cycles at &#8208;40&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross Coupling for Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Alkyl Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;activated alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl boronic acids is presented. A wide variety of alkyl aryl ketones is obtained in good yields, and the chemistry is easily applicable to stable and radiocarbon isotope labeling. The mechanism of the transformation has been investigated applying experimental and DFT methods.







Abstract
Here we present an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling for direct access to alkyl aryl ketones from readily accessible redox&#8208;activated tetrachlorophthalimide esters and aryl boronic acids. The methodology, which is run employing only 2.5&#8197;equivalents of CO and simple Ni(II) salts as the metal source, exhibits a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Furthermore, this carbonylation chemistry provides an easy switch between isotopologues for stable (13CO) and radioactive (14CO) isotope labeling, allowing its adaptation to the late&#8208;stage isotope labeling of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Based on DFT calculations as well as experimental evidence, a catalytic cycle is proposed involving a carbon&#8208;centered radical formed via nickel(I)&#8208;induced outer&#8208;sphere decarboxylative fragmentation of the redox&#8208;active ester.

         <title>Molecular Design of Hole Transport Materials to Immobilize Ion Motion for Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA&#8208;SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent T80 lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.







Abstract
Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (T95=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.

         <title>Molecular Iridium Catalyzed Electrochemical Formic Acid Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) reveals key insights into the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) mechanism. In situ spectroscopy uncovers a direct dehydrogenation pathway, preventing catalyst poisoning. The study identifies pH and potential&#8208;sensitive steps, explaining observed kinetics. This research advances our understanding of complex oxidation reactions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.







Abstract
Electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a pivotal model for understanding organic fuel oxidation and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Here, we present mechanistic insights into a novel molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) for FAOR. Our studies reveal that isolated sites facilitate a preferential dehydrogenation pathway, circumventing catalyst poisoning and exhibiting high inherent activity. In situ spectroscopic analyses elucidate that weakly adsorbed intermediates mediate the FAOR and are dynamically regulated by potential&#8208;dependent redox transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate a parallel mechanism involving two key intermediates with distinct pH and potential sensitivities. The rate&#8208;determining step is identified as the adsorption of formate via coupled or sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer, which aligns well with the observed kinetic properties, pH dependence, and hydrogen/deuterium isotope effects in experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of FAOR, advancing our understanding at the molecular level and potentially guiding the design of efficient catalysts for fuel cells and electrolyzers.

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) was constructed by using the assembled ZnS@SiO2 nanoparticles as a photonic crystal template and in situ polymerizing oligo ethylene glycol acrylate. Owing to the cosolvency&#8208;induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side&#8208;chains in ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.

         <title>Celebrating Ten Years of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solar Energy Conversion: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the first report of covalent organic frameworks as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2014, a new type of &#8220;soft photocatalyst&#8221; was released. Here, a historical overview as well as the current state of the art and future perspectives on various photocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction (ORR), and alcohol oxidation, are given.







Abstract
Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, the replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest, both societally and scientifically. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction was reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; based on porous polymers in general. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field since its inception in 2014. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction, and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learned for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field of &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; are given.

         <title>Organometallic Polymer Constructed by Active Fe&#8722;C12N8 Centers for Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic polymer constructed by Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers was prepared and employed as a high&#8208;performance electrode material for sodium&#8208;ions batteries. Benefitting from the unique &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and metallic&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;C) bonds, organic&#8208;iron polymer with microsphere morphology exhibits large reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe&#8208;PDA&#8208;220) with a unique d&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly&#8208;aminoquinone chains to form Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the distinctive Fe&#8722;C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was delivered at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 106&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 5000&#8197;cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two&#8208;electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during the sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.

         <title>Programmable In&#8208;Situ Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Multi&#8208;Block Nanowires for Cascade Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;stop spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.







Abstract
Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi&#8208;segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;step spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.

     alt="Programmable In-Situ Co-Assembly of Organic Multi-Block Nanowires for Cascade Optical Waveguides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmable in-situ co-assembly engineering, combining multi-stop spontaneous self-assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi-block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi-segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi-block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi-segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi-block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in-situ co-assembly engineering, combining multi-step spontaneous self-assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi-block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi-segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi-block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants POS or NEG were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.







Abstract
Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox/Palladium Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Racemic Heterobiaryl (Pseudo)Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synergistic photoredox/palladium catalysis was developed to realize the enantioconvergent carboxylation of racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides with CO2, affording a series of axially chiral esters in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Key to success was the utilization of an appropriate amount of alkyl bromide to trap the generated chiral carboxylic anion in situ towards the formation of conformationally stable ester.







Abstract
Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/palladium catalytic system for the efficient enantioconvergent synthesis of axially chiral esters from racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides (bromides/triflates) with CO2 and alkyl bromides under mild conditions. A wide range of axially chiral esters were obtained in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Detailed mechanistic studies unveiled that the ratio of photocatalyst and palladium catalyst exhibited significant impact on the chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of the reaction. Kinetic studies and control experiments supported the proposed mechanism involving cascade asymmetric carboxylation followed by SN2 substitution. The achievement of high enantioselectivity relies not only on the choice of synergistic metallaphotoredox catalysts but also on the utilization of alkyl bromides, which trap the generated chiral carboxylic anions in situ, thus preventing their immediate racemization.

         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nanohelixes Driven by Host&#8208;Guest Interactions and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an achiral AIEgen driven by host&#8211;guest interactions and Ag(I) coordination gave rise to well&#8208;defined nanohelixes, where the &#8220;contortion sites&#8221; produced by pillararenes enabled the helicity. Boosted luminescence and enhanced ROS productivity were achieved, allowing for applications in bacteria imaging and photodynamic antibacterial activities.







Abstract
Helical nanostructures fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of artificial motifs have been a captivating subject because of their structural aesthetics and multiple functionalities. Herein, we report the facile construction of a self&#8208;assembled nanohelix (NH) by leveraging an achiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen (G) and pillar[5]arene (H), driven by host&#8211;guest interactions and metal coordination. Inspired by the &#8220;sergeants and soldiers&#8221; effect and &#8220;majority rule&#8221; principle, the host&#8211;guest complexation between G and H is employed to fixate the twisted conformation of G for the generation of &#8220;contortion sites&#8221;, which further induced the emergence of helicity as the 1D assemblies are formed via Ag(I) coordination and hexagonally packed into nano&#8208;sized fibers. The strategy has proved feasible in both homogeneous and heterogeneous syntheses. Along with the formation of NH, boosted luminescence and enhanced productivity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are afforded because of the efficient restriction on G, indicating the concurrent regulation of NH&#8242;s morphology and photophysical properties by supramolecular assembly. In addition, NH also exhibits the capacity for bacteria imaging and photodynamic antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli).

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character.

     alt="Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By employing an anthracene-based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high-yielding synthetic method for P-doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end-capping (thio)xanthyl unit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10-anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group-based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene-based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high-yielding synthetic strategy for robust P-functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non-symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox-couple.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[4+1] Heteroannulation to Form 1&#8208;Pyrrolines through Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of in situ Generated Ynimines: Development and Application in Total Synthesis of Borrecapine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters 1 with terminal alkynes 2 affords polysubstituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines 3 which can be converted to 2H&#8208;pyrroles 4 under acidic conditions. A concise total synthesis of borrecapine was accomplished featuring this heteroannulation reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report in this paper a novel Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polysubstituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. The reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters 4 with terminal alkynes 5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OAc)2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinoline affords the corresponding 1,6&#8208;enynimines, which undergo a highly stereoselective Alder&#8208;ene reaction to afford 1&#8208;pyrrolines with concomitant generation of a quaternary carbon and a 2&#8208;azadiene motif. It represents an unusual [4+1] heteroannulation reaction wherein terminal alkynes act as a one carbon donor and are 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized. Mechanistic studies suggest that the allylic hydrogen trans to the oxime ester main chain is selectively transferred to the electron&#8208;rich alkyne during the pericyclic reaction. The resulting 1&#8208;pyrrolines undergo facile acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement to provide 2H&#8208;pyrroles in excellent yields. The 2H&#8208;pyrroles are also accessible from 4 and 5 in a one&#8208;pot manner without isolation of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines. Leveraging this heteroannulation reaction as a key step, the first total synthesis of borrecapine, a 2,3,3,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine, is accomplished.

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Atom Coordination Environments in Carbon Nanofibers via Flash Heating for Highly Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy that prevents collapse, and forms single atoms with tetra&#8208; or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination environments. This ensures fully exposed Co&#8208;N5 sites and high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The rational design of carbon&#8208;supported transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts necessitates precise atomic positioning within the precursor. However, structural collapse during pyrolysis can occlude single atoms, posing significant challenges in controlling both their utilization and coordination environment. Herein, we present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy, which ensures that the pre&#8208;designed carbon nanofiber structure remains intact during heating, preventing unforeseen collapse effects and enabling the formation of metal atoms in nano&#8208;environments with either tetra&#8208;nitrogen or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination at different flash heating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that penta&#8208;nitrogen coordinated cobalt atoms (Co&#8208;N5) promote a lower energy pathway for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions compared to the commonly formed Co&#8208;N4 sites. This strategy ensures that Co&#8208;N5 sites are fully exposed on the surface, achieving exceptionally high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. The porous, flexible carbon nanofibers significantly enhance zinc&#8208;air battery performance, with a high peak power density (273.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (784.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600&#8197;h. Additionally, the flexible fiber&#8208;shaped zinc&#8208;air battery can power wearable devices, demonstrating significant potential in flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Dimerized M&#8208;Series Acceptors with Low Diffusion Coefficients for Efficient and Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ADA&#8208;type small molecule acceptor is used to construct a dimerized acceptor (DMT&#8208;HF) which is featured with a high glass transition temperature and a low diffusion coefficient. When blended with a wide band gap copolymer, the resulting DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based polymer solar cell exhibits an excellent efficiency of 17.17&#8201;% and outstanding thermal stability.







Abstract
As the simplest oligomeric acceptors, dimerized acceptors (DAs) are easier to synthesize, and more importantly, they can retain good intermolecular interaction and photovoltaic properties of their parent small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs). Nevertheless, currently most efficient DAs are derived from banana&#8208;shaped acceptors and they might suffer from inferior device stability with high diffusion coefficients. Herein, we design and synthesize two planar DAs (DMT&#8208;FH and DMT&#8208;HF) by bridging two linear&#8208;shaped M&#8208;series SMAs with a thiophene unit. The effects of fluorination position on the diffusion coefficients, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability of the DAs are systematically studied. Our results suggest that DMT&#8208;HF with fluorination on the ending indanone groups shows enhanced intermolecular interactions, improved PCE and stability compared with the counterpart (DMT&#8208;FH) with fluorination on the central indanone groups. Further optimization on the DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based devices yields an outstanding PCE of 17.17&#8201;%, which is the highest among all linear&#8208;shaped SMA&#8208;based DAs. Notably, with the low diffusion coefficient (3.36&#215;10&#8722;24&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) of DMT&#8208;HF, the resulting device retains over 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 5000&#8197;h of continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting its excellent thermal stability. The results highlight the importance of intermolecular interaction and fluorination for achieving efficient and stable polymer solar cells.

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with covalently incorporated donor&#8208;acceptor torsional springs allow for real&#8208;time monitoring of forces, that are calibrated using known spiropyran mechanophores. This concept is demonstrated using glassy, entangled polymers and elastomeric networks.







Abstract
Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes. The agreement between both approaches underlines that these DA springs provide the unique opportunity for the online monitoring of local molecular forces present in diverse polymer matrices.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Structural Interchange Between Pd6 and Pd12 Architectures: Selective Recognition of E&#8208;Stilbene by the Pd6 Architecture and its Photoprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble trifacial barrel (C1) was synthesized which undergoes transformation into a triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) upon application of various stimuli. In aqueous media, C1 selectively encapsulates the E&#8208;isomer of stilbene (tS) and prevented its photobleaching to the Z&#8208;isomer (cS) under UV light. Conversely, C1 facilitated the reverse isomerization of cS to tS under visible light by stabilizing tS within its hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
The dynamic behaviour of metal&#8208;ligand bonding cultivates stimuli&#8208;mediated structural transformations in self&#8208;assembled molecular architectures. The propensity of synthetically designed self&#8208;assembled systems to interchange between higher&#8208;order architectures is increased multi&#8208;fold when the building blocks have higher conformational degrees of freedom. Herein, we report a new ligand, (2,7&#8208;bis(di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) (L), which, upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;[(ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine)Pd(NO3)2] acceptor (M), resulted in the formation of a M6L3 trifacial barrel (C1) in water. Interestingly, during crystallization, a rare M12L6 triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) was generated along with C1. C2 could also be generated in solution via the application of several stimuli. C1 in aqueous media could stabilize one trans&#8208;stilbene (tS) or cis&#8208;stilbene (cS) molecule in its cavity, with a selectivity for the former from their mixture. Moreover, C1 acted as an effective host to prevent the otherwise facile photoisomerization of tS to cS inside its hydrophobic cavity under UV irradiation. Conversely, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reverse isomerization of encapsulated cS to encapsulated tS could be achieved readily due to the better stabilization of tS within the cavity of C1 and its transparency to visible light. A multi&#8208;functional system was therefore designed, which at the same time is stimuli&#8208;responsive, shows isomer selectivity, and photo&#8208;protects trans&#8208;stilbene.

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;Activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could be incorporated onto the cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for specific hypoxia labeling in diverse cell lines, particularly in the monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in zebrafish models.







Abstract
Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia's role in tumorigenesis is highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression, offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Adsorbate Resonance Induces Water&#8208;Metal Bonds in Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and H2O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H2O&#8208;metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of&#160;adsorption energies on&#160;many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface&#8208;near H2O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize mediated&#160;by near&#8208;symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H2O&#8208;metal bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling of Polyamide Wastes to Tertiary Amines Using Mo Single Atoms and Rh Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of sustainable practices through the chemical recycling of polyamide wastes holds significant potential, particularly in enabling the recovery of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a novel strategy to upcycle polyamide wastes to tertiary amines with assistance of H2 in acetic acid under mild conditions (e.g., 180 &#186;C), which is achieved over anatase TiO2 supported Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles. In this protocol, the polyamide is first converted into diacetamide intermediates via acidolysis, which are subsequent hydrogenated into corresponding carboxylic acid monomers and tertiary amines in 100% selectivity. It is verified that Mo single atom and Rh nanoparticles work together to activate both amide bonds of the diacetamide intermediate, and synergistically catalyze its hydrodeoxygenation to form tertiary amine, but this catalyst is ineffective for hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. This work presents an effective way to reconstruct various polyamide wastes into tertiary amines and carboxylic acids, which may have promising application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Electron Transport Layer with Internal Encapsulation Capability for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable and compact fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional fullerene&#8208;based ETLs like C60 and PCBM are prone to aggregate under operational conditions, a challenge recently recognized by academic and industrial researchers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel cross&#8208;linkable fullerene molecule, bis((3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl) malonate&#8208;C60 monoadduct (BCM), for use as an ETL in PSCs. Upon a low&#8208;temperature annealing at 100 &#176;C, BCM undergoes in&#8208;situ cross&#8208;linking to form a robust cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film, which demonstrates excellent electron mobility and a suitable band structure for efficient PSCs. Our results show that PSCs incorporating CBCM&#8208;based ETL achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.89% (certified: 25.36%), significantly surpassing the 23.25% efficiency of PCBM&#8208;based devices. The intramolecular covalent interactions within CBCM films effectively prevent aggregation and enhance film compactness, creating an internal encapsulation layer that mitigates the decomposition and ion migration of perovskite components. Consequently, CBCM&#8208;based PSCs show exceptional stability, maintaining 97.8% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of maximum power point tracking, compared to only 78.6% retention in PCBM&#8208;based devices after less than 820 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement Interrupted Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution with alkyl and heteroaryl carbon nucleophiles has been well&#8208;established. However, the asymmetric allylic arylation of acyclic internal alkenes with aryl nucleophiles remains challenging and underdeveloped. Herein we report a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI) that enables asymmetric allylic arylation. By means of this stepwise strategy, both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities. Experimental studies support a mechanism involving a cascade of asymmetric allylic amination, stereospecific aryl 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement and alkene isomerization. Density functional theory studies detailed the reasons of achieving the high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Prompting CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanolby Iron Group Metal Ion Dopants Induced Multi&#8208;sites at the Interface of SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8722;n Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of non&#8208;copper&#8208;based materials for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high selectivity at large current density is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, we report iron group metal ions of M2+ (M = Fe, Co, or Ni)&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structures (a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2) for selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Iron group metal ions doping induces multiple active sites at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8208;n heterojunction, which strengthens *CO intermediate binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation. As a representative, Fe9.0%&#8208;a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2 exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7% and a partial current density of 239.0 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6 V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5% and a partial current density of 201.2 mA cm&#8722;2 with a full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 24.1% at 3.0 V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non&#8208;Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO2 electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single  Molecular Dispersion of Crown Ether&#8208;Decorated Cobalt Phthalocyanineon Carbon Nanotubes for Robust CO2 Reduction through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilizing molecular catalysts on electro&#8208;conductive supports (for example, multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes, CNTs) represent a promising way to well&#8208;defined catalyst/support interfaces, which has shown appreciable performance for catalytic transformation. However, their full potential is far from achieved due to insufficient utilization of the intrinsic activity for each immobilized molecular catalyst, especially at loadings that should allow decent current densities. In the present work, we discover host&#8208;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and metal ions, for example K+ ions, not only eliminate catalyst aggregation at immobilization procedures but also reinforce catalyst/support interactions by additional electrostatic attractions under operational conditions. Through simple dip&#8208;coating procedures, a successful single&#8208;molecular dispersion is achieved. Such a catalyst/electrode interface is stable and can selectively catalyze CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (&#65310;96%) with almost unchanged turnover frequency (TOF) at all loading conditions, which implies a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. Therefore, a simultaneous achievement of high TOF and high current density (TOF of 111 s&#8208;1 at 38 mA/cm2) is achieved, in an aqueous H&#8208;type electrolyzer at an overpotential of 570 mV.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synthetic Oligosaccharide Resembling Francisella tularensis Strain 15 O&#8208;Antigen Capsular Polysaccharide as a Lead for Tularemia Diagnostics and Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Francisella tularensis, a category A bioterrorism agent, causes tularemia in many animal species. F. tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) are mainly responsible for human tularemia. The high mortality rate of 30&#8208;60% caused by F. tularensis subspecies tularensis if left untreated and the aerosol dispersal renders this pathogen a dangerous bioagent. While a live attenuated vaccine strain (LVS) of F. tularensis type B does not provide sufficient protection against all forms of tularemia infections, a significant level of protection against F. tularensis has been observed for both passive and active immunization of mice with isolated O&#8208;antigen capsular polysaccharide. Well&#8208;defined, synthetic oligosaccharides offer an alternative approach towards the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. To identify diagnostics and therapeutics leads against tularemia, a collection of F. tularensis strain 15 O&#8208;antigen capsular polysaccharide epitopes were chemically synthesized. Glycan microarrays containing synthetic glycans were used to analyze the sera of tularemia&#8208;infected and non&#8208;infected animals and revealed the presence of IgG antibodies against the glycans. Two disaccharide (13 and 18), both bearing a unique formamido moiety, were identified as minimal glycan epitopes for antibody binding. These epitopes are the starting point for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics against tularemia.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustaining 500,000 Folding Cycles through Bioinspired Stress Dispersion Design in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing super&#8208;foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true&#8208;folding operations (super&#8208;foldable) due to limitations from short&#8208;range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super&#8208;foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super&#8208;foldable devices. By employing a "2+1" bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super&#8208;foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super&#8208;foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true&#8208;folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles&#8212;far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observations reveal an M&#8208;shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super&#8208;foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super&#8208;foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super&#8208;foldable devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Activation of DNAzyme Nanoassembly for Synergistically Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzymes represents a promising toolbox for gene silencing but face challenges related to poor substrate accessibility in specific cells. Herein, a compact DNA nanoassembly, incorporating multimeric therapeutic DNAzyme, was prepared for selective delivery of gene&#8208;silencing DNAzyme with requisite cofactors and auxiliary chemo&#8208;drugs. By virtue of the sequence&#8208;conservative duplex&#8208;specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR&#8208;10b&#8208;stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR&#8208;10b, thus acquiring the self&#8208;sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR&#8208;10b signaling nodes (self&#8208;adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance issues.</dc:description>

By virtue of the sequence-conservative duplex-specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site-specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR-10b-stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR-10b, thus acquiring the self-sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR-10b signaling nodes (self-adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo-resistance issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre&#8208;organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre&#8208;organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre&#8208;organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K+ cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic frameworks, i.e., CD&#8208;MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD&#8208;MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K+ cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K+ cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in their lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid&#8208;state. Our findings offer a transformative strategy for controlling the packing and orientation of ions in nanoconfined environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Polysilaketals: High&#8208;Performance Polyether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Tunable Disubstituted Silane Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes exhibit higher energy density and improved safety in lithium&#8208;ion batteries relative to traditionally used liquid electrolytes but are currently limited by their lower electrochemical performance.&#160;Aiming to access polymer electrolytes with competitive electrochemical properties, we developed the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals to synthesize amorphous silicon&#8208;containing polyether&#8208;based electrolytes with varying substituent bulk of the general formula [OSi(R)2(CH2CH2O)2]n&#160;(R = alkyl, phenyl).&#160;As opposed to previously reported uncontrolled polycondensation routes toward low molecular weight polysilaketals, AROP allows access to targeted molecular weights above the entanglement threshold of the polymers. The polysilaketal with the lowest steric bulk (P(OSiMe,Me&#8208;2EO)) exceeds the conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a leading polymer electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solid polymer electrolyte to achieve this benchmark. Steric bulk in polysilaketals was found to impart stability and two bulkier polysilaketals, P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) and P(OSiMe,Ph&#8208;2EO), exhibited higher current fractions than PEO over a wide range of salt loadings. Moreover, the efficacy of P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) was competitive with that of PEO. Taken together, the tunable and competitive electrochemical properties of polysilaketals validate the&#160;&#160;systematic incorporation of silyl groups as a strategy to access high performance polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker&#8208;Mediated Delocalized Excited States in Dimeric Acceptors Enable Efficient Exciton Dissociation with Negligible Energy&#8208;level Offsets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient exciton dissociation at low energy offsets is key to overcoming voltage losses in organic solar cells. In this work, we developed two dimeric acceptors, i&#8208;YT and o&#8208;YT, by precisely controlling the position of an asymmetric electron&#8208;donating linker. It induced the foldamer conformation of i&#8208;YT with a para linkage (relative to the dicyano groups), while retaining the unfold conformation for o&#8208;YT. This subtle structural modification influenced the molecular assembly properties, enabled near&#8208;zero energy offset exciton dissociation and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 18% for i&#8208;YT based organic solar cells. Detailed excitonic dynamics further revealed that the linker position critically influences three processes: the formation of delocalized singlet excited states, ultrafast charge transfer (~5 ps) in solid blends, and the suppression of exciton recombination. Additionally, devices based on i&#8208;YT demonstrated outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 85% of their initial efficiency after 1,400 hours of continuous illumination. These findings introduce a new class of dimeric acceptors that combine high efficiency with exceptional stability, offering a promising pathway toward low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss organic photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

In this study, we investigate the electrocatalytic properties of tetracationic cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for CO2 reduction in a heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike previous reports on cobalt&#8208;based phthalocyanine electrocatalysis, which suggested CO as an intermediate in the reduction to methanol, our findings indicate that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol, thereby excluding a mechanistic pathway where CO is an intermediate.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiOx/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.

         <dc:description>Polar molecular crystals hold a promise for controlling bulk physical properties originated in&#160;their unique switchable polarity via&#160;structural transformation.&#160;However, the mechanisms for switching polarization are mainly limited to displacive and disorder&#8208;order phase transitions, which rarely&#160;involve the&#160;reconstruction of chemical bonds. Here, we have switched&#160;and tuned electric polarization&#160;in&#160;a bimetallic halide, (Neopentylammonium)4AgBiBr8&#160;(1), as verified by light&#8208;excited pyroelectric effect. Most notably, its Ag&#8208;Br coordination bonds show a zipper&#8208;like dynamic switching behavior from the &#8216;locked&#8217;&#160;to &#8216;unlocked&#8217;&#160;state, namely, reconstruction of chemical bonds.&#160;Coupling with the dynamic ordering of organic cations,&#160;this bond&#8208;switching transition&#160;makes a contribution to switchable polarization of 1.

         <title>Li2MoO4 tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced&#160;Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery&#8217;s overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8208;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.</dc:description>

Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvation Effect&#8208;Determined Mechanisms of Cation Exchange Reactions for Efficient Multicomponent Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation exchange (CE) reaction is a classical synthesis method for creating complex structures. A lock of study on intrinsic mechanism limits its understanding and practical application. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we observed that the evolution from Ru&#8722;Cl to Ru&#8722;O/OH occurs during the CE between K2RuCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 in aqueous solution, while CE between K2PtCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 is inhibited due to the failure of structural evolution from Pt&#8722;Cl to Pt&#8722;O/OH. Theoretical simulations imply that the interaction between Ru&#8722;O and CoSn(OH)6 with Co vacancy (CoVCoSn(OH)6) endows the electron transfer, as a result of strengthened adsorption on CoVCoSn(OH)6. Moreover, this mechanism is validated for CE between K2RuCl6 and ASn(OH)6 (A = Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn), and CE between K2PdCl6/Na3RhCl6/K2IrCl6 and CoSn(OH)6. Impressively, the Pt&#8208;free CoRuSn(OH)x produced via CE displays a mass activity and a power density of 15.0 A mgRu&#8722;1 and 11.6 W mgRu&#8722;1, respectively, for anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) exceeding the values of commercial PtRu/C (11.8 A mgRu+Pt&#8722;1 and 9.0 W mgRu+Pt&#8722;1). This work, for the first time, reveals the intrinsic mechanism of CE as structural evolution of target ion breaking through the traditional classic etch&#8208;adsorption mechanism and will promote fundamental research and practical application in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Signature of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity through Spontaneous Resolution of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon within the realm of electron&#8217;s spin manipulation, showcasing a unique interplay between electron&#8217;s spin and molecular chirality. Subsequent to its discovery, researchers have been actively involved in exploring the new chiral molecules as effective spin filters. In the realm of observing the CISS effect, the conventional approach has mandated the utilization of two distinct enantiomers of chiral molecules. However, this present study represents a significant advancement by demonstrating the ability to control both spin states of electrons in a single system. In this work, we have demonstrated the preparation of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a "spontaneous resolution" process, obviating the requirement for chiral sources. Remarkably, this work signifies the first instance of achieving dual signature of spin selectivity from a single and exclusively achiral system through a spontaneous resolution process. This holds immense potential as it facilitates the production of two distinct spin&#8208;filtering materials from a unified system. In overall, the significant findings achieved using these robust and easily synthesized MOF crystals without the requirement for chiral medium represent a crucial advancement in enhancing the effectiveness of spin filtering materials to produce spintronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valent metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanomaterial with Organelle&#8208;Level Precision Primes Antitumor Immunity via mtDNA&#8208;dependent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present a strategy of targeting excessive mtDNA damages by the synergistic action of mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT&#8208;induced oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking, which leads to more release of mtDNA fragments and synergies with Mn2+ in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to significantly repolarized M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype in a STING&#8208;dependent manner. We envision that our metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial offers an attractive tool for initiating robust antitumor immunity at the organelle level.







Abstract
New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Air&#8208;Stable Radical Formation in Tetraphenylpyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer process in tetraphenylpyrene derivatives and enhanced the air stability of photo&#8208;generated radicals by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions between molecules. All TPPy, Py&#8208;TTA, and Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrate photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer processes under solid&#8208;state conditions. While TPPy exhibits limited stability of photo&#8208;induced radicals in the atmosphere, observable on the picosecond scale through femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy. Py&#8208;TTA shows a slight improvement in radical stability with weak signals observed using EPR technology despite their brief presence in the atmosphere. After irradiation, Py&#8208;TTAc molecules display distinctive EPR signals, with a radical concentration of up to 2.21&#8201;%. Moreover, Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrates excellent reproducibility in generating photo&#8208;induced radicals.







Abstract
Stable organic radicals generated by photo&#8208;excitation hold applications in molecular switching devices and information storage. It remains challenging to develop photo&#8208;generated radical materials with rapid response and air stability in the solid state. Here, we report a structure based on 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraphenylpyrene derivative (Py&#8208;TTAc) displaying photo&#8208;induced radicals with air stability in the solid state. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, exposed to a 365&#8197;nm ultraviolet lamp for 1&#8197;minute, affords radicals in Py&#8208;TTAc powder as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The maximum radical concentration reaches 2.21&#8201;% after continuous irradiation for 1&#8197;hour and recurs more than 10&#8197;times without any chemical degradation. The mechanistic study according to the femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) and X&#8208;ray technology suggests that the radicals are derived from photo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) and stabilized through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The photo&#8208;generated stable radical system is employed in anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper and optoelectronic device applications. This study will provide insights into the development of photoactive organic radical materials.

         <title>Independent LUMO Reactivity in Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Thiones: Synthesis of a Stable Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic compounds, with positive and negative charges, are expected to have dual&#8208;site highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, donor) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, acceptor) reactivity. Herein, we report&#160;a novel class of air&#8208;stable mesoionic&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs) synthesized from abnormal&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs). DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual&#8208;site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring.&#160;The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X&#8208;diffraction study.&#160;Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2&#160;gas, C&#8208;Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C&#8208;X (X = F, Br) bonds.&#160;This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxyanions Enhancing Crystallinity of Reconstructed Phase for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8208; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#183;H2O (Ni&#8208;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8208; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8208;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Polarity&#8208;Induced Regulation of Cation Solvation Sheaths for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries with a 1.94 V Discharge Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the challenge of low discharge platforms (&lt;1.5 V) in aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries, highly concentrated salts have been explored due to their wide electrochemical window (~3 V). However, these electrolytes mainly prevent hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth at the anode without significantly enhancing voltage performance. Herein we introduce an approach by adjusting solvent polarity to regulate cation solvation sheaths in hybrid electrolytes, reducing Zn/Zn2+ oxidation potential and water activity. Through strong cation&#8208;water coordination and hydrogen bonding between dimethylsulfoxide and water, the designed electrolyte, at a low concentration, achieves a broader electrochemical window (4 V) than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Using this electrolyte, a Zn/Zn battery showed an impressive cycle life of 4340 cycles, while a Zn/lithium manganate battery delivered a high discharge platform of over 1.9 V with exceptional cycling stability. A Zn&#8208;based micro&#8208;battery with a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based hybrid electrolyte also achieved a record&#8208;high discharge platform of 1.94 V. This work presents a promising strategy for developing low&#8208;concentration electrolytes for high&#8208;performance sustainable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;promoted Controlled Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization via Side Chain&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amine&#8208;pendant Polypeptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer is essential in virtually all biochemical processes, with enzymes facilitating this transfer by optimizing the proximity and orientation of reactants through site&#8208;specific hydrogen bonds. Proton transfer is also crucial in the rate&#8208;determining step for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), widely used to prepare various peptidomimetic materials. This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate the rate of chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This moiety enables hydrogen bond formation between the incoming NCA and the polymer amino growing end. The tertiary amine side chain of the NCA forms a proton shuttle, via a less constrained transition state, to facilitate the proton transfer process. Moreover, the tertiary amine side chains enable the precipitation of NCA monomers through in situ protonation during the monomer synthesis. This greatly facilitates the synthesis of these unreported monomers, allowing the direct controlled synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids. This side chain&#8208;promoted polymerization has rarely been reported. Additionally, the tertiary amine side chains, as widely used functional groups, endow the polymers with unique properties including pH&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsiveness, tunable pKas, and siRNA transfection capability. The self&#8208;promoted synthesis, facile monomer preparation, and attractive properties make tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids promising materials for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are privileged structures in both marketed drugs and natural products. On the other hand, C&#8211;H amination reactions furnish unconventional and straightforward approaches for the construction of C&#8211;N bonds. Yet, most of the known methods rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles, catalyzed by inexpensive FeCl2,&#160;which allows the functionalization of a wide range of pharmaceutically relevant cyclic amines. The C&#8211;H amination occurs site&#8208;selectively in &#945;&#8208;position to the nitrogen atom, even when weaker C&#8211;H bonds are present, and furnishes Troc&#8208;protected aminals or amidines. The method employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as limiting reagent and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Its synthetic potential was further illustrated through the derivatization of &#945;&#8208;aminated products and the application to a concise total synthesis of the reported structure for senobtusin. Mechanistic studies allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism involving a turnover&#8208;limiting Fe&#8208;nitrene generation followed by fast H atom transfer and radical rebound.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Glycan Presentation in Liquid&#8208;Ordered or &#8208;Disordered Membrane Phases and its Effect on Lectin Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan&#8208;protein interactions play a key role in various biological processes from fertilization to infections. Many of these interactions take place at the glycocalyx &#8211; a heavily glycosylated layer at the cell surface. Despite its significance, studying the glycocalyx remains challenging due to its complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature. This study introduces a glycocalyx model allowing for the first time to control spatial organization and heterogeneity of the glycan moieties. Glycan&#8208;mimetics with lipid&#8208;moieties that partition into either liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo, lipid rafts) or liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phases of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which serve as simplified cell membrane models micking lipid rafts, are developed. This phase&#8208;specific allocation allows controlled placement of glycan motifs in distinct membrane environments, creating heteromultivalent systems that replicate the natural glycocalyx's complexity. We show that phase localization of glycan mimetics significantly influences recruitment of protein receptors to the membrane. Glycan&#8208;conjugates in the ordered phase demonstrate enhanced lectin binding, supporting the idea that raft&#8208;like domains facilitate stronger receptor interactions. This study provides a platform for systematically investigating spatial and dynamic presentation of glycans in biological systems and presents the first experimental evidence that glycan accumulation in lipid rafts enhances receptor binding affinity, offering deeper insights into the glycocalyx's functional mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species, the diboriranes, tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R = H, SnMe3; Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): the H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R = H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion to a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R = SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8208;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Synthesis Enabled by Fast and Living Anionic Monoaddition of Vinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective monoaddition of polymerizable vinyl monomers like styrenes and methacrylates in a living manner has been achieved for the flash&#8208;flow preparation of molecules in a defined sequence with high selectivity. We demonstrated the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multifunctional molecules using an initiator, functionalized styrenes, diarylethylenes, various methacrylates, and an electrophilic trapping reagent at the living terminus (six&#8208;component sequential connection at maximum) without any intermediate purification steps. The anionic living terminus of the vinyl monomers in the flow system described herein is active for polymerization, such that the styrene or methacrylate sequence can be expanded to afford highly dispersed oligomers without affecting other single units, which means that the unequivocal sequences were successfully inserted into the internal or terminal positions. The methodology described herein provides an adaptable method for the construction of new molecular spaces based on unimolecular sequence control and pinpoint functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Electro&#8208;Biosynthesis of Ectoine from Greenhouse Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro&#8208;biocatalytic&#160;system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy&#8208;dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25 cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high&#8208;performance carbon&#8208;supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37 A (~175 mmolCH4 h&#8211;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62 A (~583 mmolO2 h&#8211;1). This output met the requirements of a 3&#8208;L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high&#8208;yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9 mg L&#8211;1).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon-neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro-biocatalytic&#160;system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy-dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25 cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high-performance carbon-supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37 A (~175 mmolCH4 h&#8211;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62 A (~583 mmolO2 h&#8211;1). This output met the requirements of a 3-L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high-yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9 mg L&#8211;1). This work underscores the potential of electrifying the biosynthesis of valuable products from CO2, providing a sustainable avenue for biomanufacturing and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Omnidirectional Design of Non&#8208;volatile Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 19.5%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non&#8208;volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non&#8208;volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency&#8208;boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non&#8208;volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology. Notably, the binary device (PM6:L8&#8208;BO) treated by PyMC5 achieved a PCE over 19.5%, ranking among the highest reported to date. In addition, the integration of PyMC5 mitigated the degradation process of the devices under photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stress conditions. This work demonstrates an efficient integrated omnidirectional approach for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives, offering a promising avenue for further advancements in OSC development.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline p&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238 m2 g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended p&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in pure water, and even 17080 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzylic C&#8211;H Radical Sulfation by Persulfates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfation is a highly valuable pathological and physiological process, yet it is often underappreciated considering the rather difficult accessibility of organosulfates. O&#8208;sulfonation (O&#8211;SO3), a conventional and still common way to make organosulfates, restricts its applicability to hydroxyl compounds and therein lies a major challenge of library construction. Here, we describe a benzylic C&#8211;H radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8211;O bond formation. This strategy leverages modular control over the reactivity of persulfates and the stability of sulfate radicals by coutercations. K+/NH4+ stabilized sulfate radicals act as the oxidant to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals from substrates, and activation of persulfates by NBu4+ provides O&#8211;O resource pool to facilitate C&#8211;OSO3&#8208; bond formation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of 2,6&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes by Harnessing the Potential of an&#160;3&#8208;Oxindolium Ion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its structural complexity and intrinsic sensitivity of bridged aminal junction, 2,6&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) has remained a highly desirable target in synthetic chemistry. However, the asymmetric access to this unit is still insufficient and hampered by the need for meticulously created functionalities for intricate double aza&#8208;cyclizations. Herein, we have developed a novel enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective protocol to access polycyclic chiral 2,6&#8208;DABCOs under metal&#8208;free conditions. This domino process involves the amine&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation between glutaraldehyde and 2&#8208;arylindol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, followed by an acid&#8208;mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction/intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization cascade sequence with tryptamine by trapping of in situ generated 3&#8208;oxindolium ion intermediate for the first time. Overall, 2,6&#8208;DABCOs fused with medicinally relevant scaffolds were isolated with good yield and excellent stereoselectivity by constructing five new bonds and four stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt; 90%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Porous materials-based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)-based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C-N and C-O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron-donating and -withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late-stage functionalization of bio-active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provides mechanistic insights in these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tricyclic Framework with Integrated B&#8592;N and Cyano Dual Functionalization for Superior n&#8208;Type Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers featuring low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, the synthesis of acceptors with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics presents a significant challenge. Herein, a peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the widely used tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to enhance its electron&#8208;withdrawing capability. This approach successfully navigates synthetic challenges, leading to the development of two novel acceptor building blocks: DBNF and DBNCN. Compared to the counterparts with a single N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 moiety, DBNF and DBNCN exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Utilizing these innovative acceptor monomers, copolymers, PDBNF and PDBNCN, are synthesized, which exhibit considerably suppressed LUMO &#8776; &#8211;4.0 eV. The deep LUMO of PDBNF together with its favourable bimodal packing orientation leads to remarkable electron mobility of 3.04 cm&#178; V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; with improved stability in OTFTs. Importantly, efficient n&#8208;doping in OTEs is achieved with PDBNCN, exhibiting exceptional conductivity of 95.5 S cm&#8315;&#185; and a maximum power factor of 147.8 &#956;W m&#8315;&#185; K&#8315;&#178;&#8212;among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Dissipation and Toughening of Covalent Networks via a Sacrificial Conformation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent polymer networks find wide utility in diverse engineering applications owing to their desirable stiffness and resilience. However, the rigid covalent chemical structure between crosslinking points imposes limitations on enhancing their toughness. Although the incorporation of sacrificial chemical bonds has shown promise in improving toughness through energy dissipation, composite networks struggle to maintain both rapid recovery and stiffness. Consequently, a significant challenge persists in achieving a covalent network that combines high strength, stiffness, toughness, and fast recovery performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sacrificial structure termed "sacrificial conformation." In this approach, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is covalently embedded into the network skeleton as the sacrificial conformation element.&#160; Compared to traditional covalent networks (LCN), well&#8208;designed cyclodextrin&#8208;embedded covalent network (CCN) exhibit a 100&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus and a 60&#8208;fold increase in toughness. Importantly, CCN maintains excellent elasticity, ensuring swift recovery after deformation. This sacrificial conformational strategy enables efficient energy dissipation without necessitating the rupture of chemical bonds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. This advancement holds great promise for the design and fabrication of advanced elastomers and hydrogels with superior mechanical properties and dynamic behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named&#160;Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8208;L1&#160;and HER2&#160;targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+&#160;T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient transition from stable to dissipative assemblies in response to the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy&#8208;dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self&#8208;assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy&#8208;dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant&#8208;based structures templated by ATP. Injection of substrate leads to the inclusion of additional surfactant molecules in the assemblies leading to the formation of catalytic hotspots for substrate conversion. After the local disappearance of the substrate as a result of chemical conversion and diffusion the assemblies spontaneously return to the stable state, which can be reactivated upon the injection of a new batch of fuel. The study illustrates how a dissipating self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#8208;Site Engineering with Thiophene&#8208;Based Ammonium for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D/3D Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTin halide perovskites are the most promising candidate materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) thanks to their low toxicity and ideal bandgap energies. The introduction of 2D/3D mixed perovskite phases in tin&#8208;based PSCs (TPSCs) has proven to be the most effective approach to improving device efficiency and stability. However, a 2D perovskite phase normally shows relatively low carrier mobility, which will be unfavorable for carrier transfer in the devices. In this work, we used a thiophene&#8208;based cation 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) as a spacer to form a novel 2D perovskite phase in TPSCs, which shows the most promising effect on the performance enhancement in comparison with other cations like 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (2&#8208;TEA) and benzene&#8208;based 2&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (PEA). Theoretical calculations reveal that 3&#8208;TEA enables the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8208; octahedral layers, resulting in the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the 2D phase. This effect significantly enhances device efficiency and stability by facilitating more efficient carrier transfer within the 2D phase. These findings indicate that thiophene&#8208;based 2D perovskites are well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;performance TPSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8208;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M = Li&#8211;Cs). As predicted by VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level, and confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy as well as isotopic labeling, [OF3]&#8722; exhibits a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shaped structure with one short and two long O&#8208;F bond distances. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of 2c&#8208;2e bond and one 3c&#8208;4e bond. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8226;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8226;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M = Na&#8211;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8226;&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long&#8208;lived excited states and bathochromically&#8208;shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well&#8208;studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements. We report the unexpected ORTP of a series of heavy atom&#8208;free BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives. The creation of heteroatom&#8208;rich scaffolds, combined with stabilizing C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions in the solid&#8208;state, resulted in oxygen&#8208;tolerant heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphorescence without relying on the use of cryogenic temperatures, polymer matrices, or host&#8208;guest interactions. The observation of ORTP in these simple systems sets a blueprint for the further development of heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Interception of Alkynyl Tetracoordinate Borons with Sulfur Electrophiles beyond the Zweifel Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zweifel reaction is a powerful strategy to construct olefins from alkenyl tetracoordinate borons in organoboron chemistry, however, it usually only involves one functional group migration and then undergoes an elimination process affording alkenes or alkynes exclusively. Herein, we disclose several intriguing interception of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons with sulfur electrophiles. Wherein, the substituted benzothiophenes are accessed by consecutive 1,2&#8208;migrations and intramolecular electrophilic substitution, meanwhile, the challenging and elusive five/four&#8208;membered boracycles are easily assembled, and an approach to alkenyl sulfides with good stereoselectivity was developed as well. Moreover, by adding readily available deuterium sources, the tetrasubstituted deuterated alkenyl sulfides with high deuteration rates are constructed. These protocols not only improve atom economy by prohibiting the elimination of Zweifel intermediate, but also enriches the reaction modes of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons achieving versatile value&#8208;added sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride&#8208;type reagents (DAST&#8208;type) as surfur sources could promote dual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons, which are distinct from traditional Zweifel reaction, and the regulation of steric hindrance could also make four&#8208;membered boracycles and alkenyl sulfides feasible. And these transformations feature novel reaction modes and unusual reaction mechanisms with valuable products in high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on HBPDC bind to SnO2 through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb2+) atoms through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO2 and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron&#8208;deficient nature of HBPDC enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBPDC strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Aldimine Umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Cascade to Access Tetracyclic Dihydrochromeno Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8208;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox Reactions of Silver Hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue Analogue Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Zinc&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs. Herein, a vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6 (AgHCF&#8208;3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs. Herein, a vacancy and water-free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6 (AgHCF-3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework. It offers nearly four electrons involving two sequential redox reactions, namely, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0, to deliver a large capacity of 179.6 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 with Coulomb efficiency of ~100%. The Zn//AgHCF-3 cell delivers an estimated energy density of 200 Wh kg-1, surpassing reported PBAs-based ZIBs. The formation of Ag0 in the cycling process merits favorable rate performance of AgHCF-3 (156.4 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 with 80.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles). This investigation paves new pathways for high-capacity PBA cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triplet Energy Gap&#8208;Regulated Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8208;guest Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8208;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8208;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8208;guest doped materials, using Benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest&#8217;s triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET&#160;is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET&#160;is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption, and theoretical calculations, A bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET&#160;and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host&#8208;guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>

A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency.

&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real-time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non-invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost-effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2-fold increase in [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy-metal-containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE-SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3-fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof-of-concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%.

     alt="Alder-Ene Reaction-Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin-Lead Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long-term stability and performance of devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin-lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in reacting with oxygen through the Alder-ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1-sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all-perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high-performance and stable all-perovskite tandem solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

     alt="Bis-Silylene-Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis-silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterocycle. In the presence of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative Al&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; type complex. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene- and aluminylene-coordinated Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8722;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is rationally designed by the cation exchange method featuring self&#8208;limitation in the precise control over the composition and structure. The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual-atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion-exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self-limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual-atom in the IrMnO&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual-atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual-atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual-atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via the oxygen-oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir-SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir-SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a stable 2000-h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.







Abstract
A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>

         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

&lt;p&gt;The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard-to-obtain axially chiral 2-azaarene-functionalized quinazolinones.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS-related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X-ray structure of the crystals with &#960;-complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X-ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>

Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Migratory Hydroamidocarbonylation of Amide&#8208;Linked Alkenes to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Succinimides</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Artificial Polymerizations in Living Organisms for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>

         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

&lt;p&gt;The marine Bacteroidota &lt;i&gt;Zobellia galactanivorans&lt;/i&gt; has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;-3,6-anhydro-D-galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo-(&#945;-1,3)-3,6-anhydro-D-galactosidase &lt;i&gt;Zg&lt;/i&gt;GH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D-galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6-anhydro-D-galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;[&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and deglycosylation &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;[&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt; itineraries limited to the &lt;i&gt;Southern&lt;/i&gt; Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non-standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism-based inhibitor design for anhydro-type carbohydrate-processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche-based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate-active enzyme family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.
