         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks are of interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their&#160;structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching&#160;with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The photoluminescence quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6% to 90.4%. We found that the&#160;enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure&#160;optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8208;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in the MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3 + 2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li || CF  x  ) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X = PF  6  &#8722;  , TFSI  &#8722;  , BF  4  &#8722;  , ClO  4  &#8722;  , and CF  3  SO  3  &#8722;  ) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF  4  &#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li || CF  x  cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CF  x  cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF  4  &#8722;  anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li || CF  x  cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesopores in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated  in situ  ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize  C  &#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles using Visible&#8208;Light Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that both undergo isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, allowing for control of the number of monomers involved in cyclo&#8208;oligomerization, which were investigated using 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/VIS spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Pd Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While exposed support facet of supported catalysts plays a crucial role in catalysis, this is usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured ZIF&#8208;8x@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 composites (X represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, including ZIF&#8208;8C  exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD  exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD  exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring small Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, are rationally fabricated for hydrogenation of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Remarkably, the Pd electronic state is tailored by ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of &#8211;NO2  and &#8211;Cl group of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. As a result, the ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit excellent activity (97.6%) and selectivity (98.1%) to  p&#8208;chloroaniline, far superior to other counterparts. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports for modulating microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically require expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such transformation is relevant for industry as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine chemicals due to the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different set of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes avoiding the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last years paving the way for generating more sustainable protocols including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes utilizing more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is challenge but it is vital. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO  2  substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO  2  ) was synthesized as an excellent electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3 mA mg  Ru  &#8208;1  at &#8208;0.05 V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO  2  , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutileTiO  2  &#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutileTiO  2  facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti  4+  with P  5+  enhanced H  2  generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an important strategy for developing new reactions in stereodivergent synthesis. This strategy is also a simple and powerful approach for synthesizing all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters from the same set of starting materials. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and briefly gives perspectives for the future advancement of this field.







Abstract
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative&#8208;ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with CoCl2 and organolithium reagents.







Abstract
Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and High&#8208;Yielding Fluorination of Highly Basic Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>

         <dc:description>
By developing a sterically hindered fluorinating agent, N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved an unprecedented high&#8208;yield fluorination of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species.







Abstract
Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8722;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic polymers block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids giving an efficient protein and peptide encapsulation. Profiting from the high mass fraction of therapeutics (58.3&#8197;wt%), the mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times lower than that with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones. One injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites held the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
The control of cargo phase&#8208;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Herein, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright, forming a thick three&#8208;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8208;water interface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly prevented the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1&#8201;%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites (58.3&#8197;wt%) kept the blood glucose level within the normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days in type&#8197;1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene nanosheets introduced to SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells maximize the interface matching between SnO2 and perovskite and induce vertically aligned crystal growth. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by 15&#8201;%, reaching 23.07&#8201;%, and the short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, an unencapsulated device maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 500&#8197;h of storage in ambient air.







Abstract
Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15&#8201;% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after 500&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8211;40&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.

         <title>Reductive Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;Bond Formation in Alumaboranes: Facile Scission of Polar Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of rare Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bonds is facilitated employing a peri&#8208;AlI2/BMes2 naphthalene scaffold, which upon reduction forms an alumaborane diethyl ether adduct. Reagents with polar multiple bonds (C=O, C&#8801;N, C=S) undergo complete scission with insertion of the heteroatom into Al&#8722;B bond. The findings help to understand the differences between Al&#8722;C bonds widely employed in aluminum organyls and scarcely studied alumaboranes with Al&#8722;B bonds.







Abstract
We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1&#8208;(AlI2), 8&#8208;(BMes2) naphthalene (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) affords the alumaborane species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)(OEt2)&#8208;8&#8208;B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond performs the reductive scission of multiple bonds: S=C(NiPrCMe)2 affords the naphthalene bridged motif B&#8722;S&#8722;Al(NHC), NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, while O=CPh2 is deoxygenated to afford an B&#8722;O&#8722;Al bridged species with incorporation of the remaining &#8801;CPh2 fragment into the naphthalene scaffold. The reaction with isonitrile Xyl&#8208;N&#8801;C (Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H4) proceeds via a proposed (amino boryl) carbene species; which adds a second equivalent of isonitrile to ultimately form the Al&#8722;N&#8722;B bridged species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)&#8208;N(Xyl)&#8208;8&#8208;B{C(Mes)=C&#8722;N&#8722;Xyl}] with complete scission of the C&#8801;N triple bond. The latter reaction is supported with isolated intermediates and by DFT calculations.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed In&#8722;Cu metal pairs anchored on polymeric carbon nitride catalysts (InCu/PCN) were designed and produced by a facile thermal polymerization approach to support photocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol. The metal pairs exert synergistic interactions that enhance the activity and adsorption of metal sites to promote C&#8722;C coupling and subsequent formation of ethanol.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to C2+ solar fuel is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. This strategy is challenged by its low productivity due to low efficiency in multielectron utilization and slow C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. This work reports a dual&#8208;metal photocatalyst consisting of atomically dispersed indium and copper anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (InCu/PCN), on which the photoreduction of CO2 delivered an excellent ethanol production rate of 28.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 92&#8201;%. Coupled experimental investigation and DFT calculations reveal the following mechanisms underpinning the high performance of this catalyst. Essentially, the In&#8722;Cu interaction enhances the charge separation by accelerating charge transfer from PCN to the metal sites. Indium also transfers electrons to neighboring copper via Cu&#8722;N&#8722;In bridges, increasing the electron density of copper active sites. Furthermore, In&#8722;Cu dual&#8208;metal sites promote the adsorption of *CO intermediates and lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Controlling the Transition of Nanospheres to Superhelices in Aqueous Media by Using a &#8220;Smart&#8221; Pyrazine Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy to control the supramolecular chirality and morphology of co&#8208;assembled architecture of Pyra&#8208;Met in the presence of Au3+ ions and L&#8208;methionine in aqueous media has been described by fine tailoring of the chiral handle of the pyrazine building block.







Abstract
For the development of nature&#8208;inspired chiral nanostructures, controlling the chirality communication along the assembling pathways in aqueous media is a crucial task. Herein, we designed and synthesized pyrazine&#8208;based derivative Pyra&#8208;Met with an L&#8208;methionine group as a chiral handle. Due to the presence of flexible side chains in the Pyra&#8208;Met building block, its interactions with the solvent molecules in the assembled state are restricted, which leads to the generation of nanospheres in aqueous media. The Pyra&#8208;Met nanospheres selectively interact with Au3+ ions to generate dynamic helical fibers of the Pyra&#8208;Met:Au3+ ensemble with &#8216;hidden&#8217; chirality. Finally, superhelices with the desired helical sense are achieved in the presence of L/D&#8208;methionine via a co&#8208;assembly process. This work presents a feasible strategy to achieve the desired handedness of supramolecular assemblies for better understanding of chirality translation in supramolecular chemistry and it highlights the importance of fine tailoring of building block to control the morphology of the assembled architecture.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Ubiquitin&#8208;like Protein ISG15 Tools through Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Ligation Catalyzed by a Viral Protease Lbpro</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protease (Lbpro) from foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can ligate synthetic glycyl compounds to ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15), generating various ISG15 protein tools for cellular proteomic studies, as well as screening and evaluation of small molecules against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). This strategy can also synthesize ISG15&#8208;modified peptide and Ub (ubiquitin)/NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;like protein ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15) regulates innate immunity and links with the evasion of host response by viruses such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Dissecting ISGylation pathways recently received increasing attention which can inform related disease interventions, but such studies necessitate the preparation and development of various ISG15 protein tools. Here, we find that the leader protease (Lbpro) encoded by foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can promote ligation reactions between recombinant ISG15 and synthetic glycyl compounds, generating protein tools such as ISG15&#8208;propargylamide and ISG15&#8208;rhodamine110, which are needed for cellular proteomic studies of deISGylases, and the screening and evaluation of inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). Furthermore, this strategy can be also used to load ISG15 onto the lysine of a synthetic peptide through an isopeptide bond, and prepare Ub and NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride with nanoporous framework. However, pores in PTI are blocked by Li+ and halide ions, and a complete removal of ions leads to an impermeable AB stacking. We report an ion&#8208;exchange route which tunably opens pore channels while maintaining the AA&#8242; configuration leading to an improved proton conductivity.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.

         <title>Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized as benign electron&#8208;donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell&#8208;membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.







Abstract
Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g. by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake.

     alt="Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is utilized as benign electron-donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell-membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H-dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH-regeneration as it is performed, e.g. by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time-consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H-dependent redox reactions. The modular photo-electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme- or substrate-toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99&#8201;% and giving products with &amp;gt;99&#8201;% optical purity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereogradient Poly(Lactic Acid) from meso&#8208;Lactide/L&#8208;Lactide Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide mixtures was carried out at 180&#8201;&#176;C by employing a highly syndioselective catalyst based on a zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand. Stereogradient copolymers that exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers were obtained with the industrial catalyst.







Abstract
The production of L&#8208;lactide from L&#8208;lactic acid involves a substantial formation of meso&#8208;lactide as an impurity, and, upon polymerization with the industrial catalyst tin octanoate, results in poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) of reduced crystallinity due to stereoerrors randomly distributed along the polymer chains. We describe a new approach wherein, instead of avoiding stereoerrors by removing the meso&#8208;lactide prior to polymerization, the stereoerrors in the polymer are tolerated, by crowding them in a stereogradient copolymer. A zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand is found to exhibit very high syndioselectivity in the ring opening polymerization catalysis of meso&#8208;lactide at room temperature, and gives rise to stereogradient copolymers in the polymerization of mixtures of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide in the melt at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers obtained with tin octanoate, the stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities manifested in lower solubilities and higher melting temperatures and enthalpies.

         <title>P and Cu Dual Sites on Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbon Fuels with High C2H6 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu and P dual sites were constructed in carbon nitride matrix for achieving highly efficient separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Benefiting from the unique dual sites structure, P/Cu SAs@CN exhibited outstanding photocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2H6.







Abstract
The light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi&#8208;electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C2H6 evolution rate of 616.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge&#8208;enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible process for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C2H6 on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to high value&#8208;added carbon products.

The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures is achieved for the first time. In photocatalytic H2 production, the 2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF shows a unique &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;hybrid&#8221; effect, which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;identical&#8221; 2D, 3D, and 3D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF structures.







Abstract
A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure is attractive in material science because of its potential combined effects in catalysis. However, precisely controlling the growth pattern at the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nucleation stage to manipulate the metallic composition and structure dimensionality remain a challenge. Herein, we introduce a polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;assist kinetic&#8208;control strategy to achieve the &#8220;anti&#8208;epitaxial growth&#8221; pattern of a foreign MOF nucleus on the (111) facets of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 octahedron seeds, and construct diverse two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) MOF heterostructures (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni).

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanistic Pathway of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Driven by a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoI complex bearing a redox&#8208;active &#954;&#8208;N3P2 pentadentate ligand and its activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction is reported in this work. A combination of spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational techniques is employed to characterize the intermediate species, demonstrating an unusual homolytic coupling reaction pathway between two catalyst units.







Abstract
A cobalt complex bearing a &#954;&#8208;N3P2 ligand is presented (1+ or CoI(L), where L is (1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(3&#8208;(diphenylphosphanyl)propyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine). Complex 1+ is stable under air at oxidation state CoI thanks to the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the phosphine groups. Electrochemical behavior of 1+ reveals a two&#8208;electron CoI/CoIII oxidation process and an additional one&#8208;electron reduction, which leads to an enhancement in the current due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at Eonset=&#8722;1.6&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+. In the presence of 1&#8197;equiv of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, 1+ forms the cobalt hydride derivative CoIII(L)&#8208;H (22+), which has been fully characterized. Further addition of 1&#8197;equiv of CoCp*2 (Cp* is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) affords the reduced CoII(L)&#8208;H (2+) species, which rapidly forms hydrogen and regenerates the initial CoI(L) (1+). The spectroscopic characterization of catalytic intermediates together with DFT calculations support an unusual bimolecular homolytic mechanism in the catalytic HER with 1+.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a theranostic prodrug that could self&#8208;report the drug release, immunogenic cell death (ICD) progression, and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation with activated near&#8208;infrared afterglow chemiluminescence. Such an intelligent prodrug also shows a unique self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect, completely eradicating the existing tumor and preventing further tumor recurrence through enhanced antitumor immune response.







Abstract
Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that the prodrug can eradicate existing tumors and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salt for Ultrarapid Adsorption/Desorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting by Dual Hydrogen Bond System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we explored the application of crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) in atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) for the first time and synthesized a novel CPOS (CPOS&#8208;6), which showed excellent AWH performance attributed to its unique dual hydrogen bond system.







Abstract
In recent years, the porous sorbent&#8208;assisted atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) method has emerged as an effective approach for solving water crises without geographical restrictions. However, there is a limited array of porous adsorbent materials that can be used for AWH, which are inadequate to meet the needs under different climatic conditions. In light of this, herein, we synthesize a new crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS; denoted as CPOS&#8208;6) possessing a dual hydrogen bond system and verify its applicability toward AWH for the first time. Unlike other reported CPOSs, CPOS&#8208;6 displays an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm owing to the presence of the dual hydrogen bond system. Under simulated drought conditions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, CPOS&#8208;6 exhibits long&#8208;term water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycling stability, low water desorption temperature, and ultrarapid adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. The results confirm that CPOS&#8208;6 is an effective sorbent material for AWH.

         <title>Alloying at a Subnanoscale Maximizes the Synergistic Effect on the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase separation in nanoparticles is undesirable from the viewpoint of the synergistic effects between elements in catalytic applications. Here, we propose the general concept that subnanoparticles are not phase&#8208;separated and are an effective means for the expression of elemental synergies.







Abstract
Bonding dissimilar elements to provide synergistic effects is an effective way to improve the performance of metal catalysts. However, as the properties become more dissimilar, achieving synergistic effects effectively becomes more difficult due to phase separation. Here we describe a comprehensive study on how subnanoscale alloying is always effective for inter&#8208;elemental synergy. Thirty&#8208;six combinations of both bimetallic subnanoparticles (SNPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) were studied systematically using atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and catalyst benchmarking based on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results revealed that SNPs always produce greater synergistic effects than NPs, the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr. The atomic&#8208;scale miscibility and the associated modulation of electronic states at the subnanoscale were much different from those at the nanoscale, which was observed by annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.

         <title>Formation of a Strong Heterogeneous Aluminum Lewis Acid on Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al(OC(CF3)3)3(PhF) reacts with partially dehydroxylated silica to form very strong Lewis acid sites. The well&#8208;defined aluminum Lewis acids are significantly stronger than common molecular Lewis acids and engage in alkyl abstraction reactions that are uncommon using well&#8208;defined supported Lewis acids.







Abstract
Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) reacts with silanols present on partially dehydroxylated silica to form well&#8208;defined &#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(O(Si&#8801;)2) (1). 27Al&#8197;NMR and DFT calculations with a small cluster model to approximate the silica surface show that the aluminum in 1 adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry by coordinating to a nearby siloxane bridge and a fluorine from the alkoxide. Fluoride ion affinity (FIA) calculations follow experimental trends and show that 1 is a stronger Lewis acid than B(C6F5)3 and Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) but is weaker than Al(OC(CF3)3) and iPr3Si+. Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with 1 to form [Cp2ZrCH3][&#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(CH3)] (3) by methide abstraction. This reactivity pattern is similar to reactions of organometallics with the proposed strong Lewis acid sites present on Al2O3.

         <title>Construction of Perylene&#8208;based Amphiphilic Micelle and Its Efficient Adsorption and In Situ Photodegradation of Bisphenol A in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new idea of designing self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic micelles containing photo&#8208;functional perylene blocks for &#8220;selective adsorption/catalytic degradation&#8221; of bisphenol A (BPA) has been put forward. The results show that the micelles possess high mass&#8208;transfer efficiency with ultrafast adsorption rate (within 10&#8197;s), high adsorption capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high selectivity for BPA, which greatly improves the BPA photodegradation efficiency.







Abstract
Low mass&#8208;transfer efficiency and reaction&#8208;driving force make it difficult to realize thorough purification in traditional low&#8208;concentration pollutant treatments. Herein, we propose an &#8220;adsorption/catalysis in situ&#8221; perylene based bifunctional micelle for efficient, accurate and rapid adsorption and catalytic degradation of low&#8208;concentration bisphenol A (BPA). They show super&#8208;fast (within 10&#8197;s), high capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and selectivity for BPA adsorption, due to &#960;&#8211;&#960;, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The BPA degradation efficiency improves by up to 8&#8197;times after forming micelles compared with simple perylene nanorods, which is primarily due to the superior mass&#8208;transfer from adsorption. Moreover, self&#8208;assembly can optimize the stacking of the perylene moieties and facilitate charge transfer in micelle, and the regular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of inside perylene units enhances the response to visible light, resulting in high catalytic capacity and good cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;A new idea of designing self-assembled amphiphilic micelles containing photo-functional perylene blocks for &#8220;selective adsorption/catalytic degradation&#8221; of bisphenol A (BPA) has been put forward. The results show that the micelles possess high mass-transfer efficiency with ultrafast adsorption rate (within 10&#8197;s), high adsorption capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and high selectivity for BPA, which greatly improves the BPA photodegradation efficiency.

         <title>Nearly&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield and 12&#8208;Hour Afterglow from a Transparent Perovskite of Cs2NaScCl6:Tb</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent Cs2NaSc1&#8722;xCl6:xTb3+ single crystals with ca. 98.2&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) were grown by a hydrothermal method. The doped crystal exhibited an intense green afterglow of 12&#8197;hours upon ceasing the X&#8208;ray excitation. Based on this improved output of the transparent crystals, a radiation&#8208;storage battery was designed, which has a linear&#8208;scaling capacity with loading weight.







Abstract
Unlike afterglow phosphors, transparent crystals free of scattering issues hold great potential in applications such as volumetric displays and three&#8208;dimensional encryption. Here, a double&#8208;perovskite host of ca. 85&#8201;% transparency, a Cs2NaScCl6 single crystal, was grown in aqueous solution. Through heavy doping of Tb ions, the crystal exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) up to 98.2&#8201;%. Both steady&#8208;state and transient PL spectroscopic investigation revealed a cross&#8208;relaxation efficiency (&#951;CR&#8776;99&#8201;%) between Tb ions, greatly mitigated the electron saturation on the 5D3 level and encouraged the radiative route against quenching. The doped crystal displayed an intense afterglow of up to 12&#8197;h after ceasing the X&#8208;ray excitation, allowing it to be used in a radiation&#8208;storage battery which has a linear scaling capacity with loading weight. Our work opens possibilities in photo&#8208;stimulated volumetric display and three&#8208;dimensional information storage.

         <title>Efficient Gene Silencing in Intact Plant Cells Using siRNA Delivered By Functional Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) can be used to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) into intact plant cells by forming a small, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex. The GONs&#8208;siRNA complex could cross the intact cell wall and internalize into plant cells, resulting in highly efficient and transient gene silencing. This provides an efficient, transient, simple, and safe strategy for plant gene engineering.







Abstract
Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to intact plants for gene silencing mainly relies on viral vectors and Agrobacterium&#8208;mediated transformation due to the barrier of intact plant cell wall. Here, we reported that polymer functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) enable siRNA transfer into intact plant cells and bring about efficient gene silencing. We found that sheeted GONs could efficiently load siRNA to form small sized, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex, which could be across the cell wall and internalize in the plant cell. The GONs&#8208;siRNA exhibited transient and strong silencing (97.2&#8201;% efficiency) in plant tissues at 24&#8197;h after treatment and returned to normal level at 5&#8197;days after treatment. This method has the obvious advantages of efficient, transient, simple, stability and well biocompatibility, which should greatly stimulate the application of nanomaterials as gene&#8208;engineering tools in plant research.

Alder&#8208;Longo reaction between aldehyde groups of CDs based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CDs) and dipyrrolo methane results in porphyrin patterns connecting the F&#8208;CDs. This gives a light&#8208;sensitive organic network. This can initiate photopolymerization following a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol upon 405 LED excitation. End&#8208;group fidelity was shown by block polymerization where CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722;, and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst resulted in formation of polymer.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CD) resulted in a photosensitive material after pursuing the Alder&#8208;Longo reaction. The porphyrin moiety formed connects the F&#8208;CDs in a covalent organic network. This heterogeneous material (P&#8208;CD) was characterized by XPS indicating incorporation of the respective C, N and O moieties. Time resolved fluorescence including global analysis showed contribution of three linked components to the overall dynamics of the excited state. Electrochemical and photonic properties of this heterogeneous material facilitated photopolymerization in a photo&#8208;ATRP setup where either CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722; or a metal free reaction setup activated controlled polymerization. Chain extension experiments worked in all three cases showing end group fidelity for activation of controlled block copolymerization using MMA and styrene as monomers. Traditional radical polymerization using a diaryl iodonium salt as co&#8208;initiator failed.

         <title>Ribbon&#8208;Type Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: Conformations, Dynamic Complexation and Electronic Properties</title>

We disclose photocyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension as an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped molecular ribbons. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including two isomers with the C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons were synthesized, and their contorted topological conformations, photochromism behaviors and electronic properties were demonstrated.







Abstract
Molecular ribbons (MRs), one&#8208;dimentional topological polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of importance for synthetic chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we disclose an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped MRs, i.e. photochemical cyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped PAHs that own multiple cove edges were synthesized using Mallory photoreaction in solution. Two of them feature isomeric C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons with 2.2&#8197;nm in length, thus representing a new kind of boron&#8208;doped MRs. The boron atoms endow them with sufficient Lewis acidity, and notably, the formed Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts based on boron&#8208;doped MRs display the photo&#8208;induced dual&#8208;dissociation behavior in the excited state and thus photochromism property. Moreover, despite of the highly contorted topological conformations, their potential utility as organic semiconductor was demonstrated by fabrication of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

&lt;p&gt;We disclose photocyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;-extension as an effective strategy to develop boron-doped molecular ribbons. A series of ribbon-type boron-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including two isomers with the C&lt;sub&gt;68&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#960;-skeletons were synthesized, and their contorted topological conformations, photochromism behaviors and electronic properties were demonstrated.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular ribbons (MRs), one-dimentional topological polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of importance for synthetic chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we disclose an effective strategy to develop boron-doped MRs, i.e. photochemical cyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;-extension. A series of ribbon-type boron-doped PAHs that own multiple cove edges were synthesized using Mallory photoreaction in solution. Two of them feature isomeric C&lt;sub&gt;68&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#960;-skeletons with 2.2&#8197;nm in length, thus representing a new kind of boron-doped MRs. The boron atoms endow them with sufficient Lewis acidity, and notably, the formed Lewis acid-base adducts based on boron-doped MRs display the photo-induced dual-dissociation behavior in the excited state and thus photochromism property. Moreover, despite of the highly contorted topological conformations, their potential utility as organic semiconductor was demonstrated by fabrication of organic field-effect transistors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unshared Pair Electrons of Zincophilic Lewis Base Enable Long&#8208;life Zn Anodes under &#8220;Three High&#8221; Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy by introducing Lewis basic solvent additive with unshared pair electrons in electrolyte is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefitting from the zincophilic feature and unique electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristic of Lewis basic unshared pair electrons, the designed electrolytes promote the Coulombic efficiency and lifespan in both Zn symmetric and full cells at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and dendrite issues are the notorious culprits of the limited lifespan and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn anodes, particularly at harsh test conditions. Herein, considering the Lewis acidic feature of Zn2+, abundant unshared pair electrons of zincophilic Lewis bases are proposed as decent electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions (high depth of discharge, high areal capacity and high current). The unshared pair electrons can remove H2O from Zn2+ solvated sheaths and confine the activity of H2O by breaking its hydrogen bonding network. The combination of these factors effectively restricts H2O&#8208;involved side reactions and enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, even at harsh conditions. The effectiveness of this strategy is fully proved by a series of Lewis base molecules. Noticeably, the Zn||Zn cell with an area of 20&#8197;cm2, using DMF&#8208;containing electrolyte can be stably cycled over 1000&#8197;h at 60&#8201;% DOD, with a 100&#8201;% CE.

         <title>Modular Construction of Heterobiaryl Atropisomers and Axially Chiral Styrenes via All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted VQMs</title>

         <dc:description>
A chiral all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted VQM is generated by chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed nucleophilic addition of 2&#8208;alkynylnaphthols to o&#8208;quinone methides or imines, and it can be captured intramolecularly by a cycloaddition reaction. A wide range of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a new type of chiral all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted VQMs generated via chiral phosphoric acids catalyzed nucleophilic addition of 2&#8208;alkynylnaphthols to o&#8208;quinone methides or imines, which can be captured intramolecularly as a result of cycloaddition reaction. A new class of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities. Noteworthy, the enantioselective cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with o&#8208;quinone methides proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition, followed by a retro&#8208;4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and a 6&#960; re&#8208;cyclization. While the cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with imines proceeded via a sequential [2+4] cycloaddition and an auto oxidation reaction. Moreover, the obtained axially chiral naphthols can be converted into valuable phosphine ligands and other functional molecules.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Effects for the Regioselective Zincation of Diazines Using TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (X=Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important N&#8208;heterocycles such as pyrimidines were regioselectively zincated using bimetallic bases of type TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br) and subsequently quenched with electrophiles. Trapping of key organometallic intermediates has shed light on their complex solution constitution and helped to explain the high regioselectivity observed as well as the stoichiometry of the base used.







Abstract
A new method for regioselective zincations of challenging N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates such as pyrimidines and pyridazine was reported using bimetallic bases TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br). Reactions occurred under mild conditions (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, using 1.75 equivalents of base without additives), furnishing 2&#8208;zincated pyrimidines and 3&#8208;zincated pyridazine, which were then trapped with a variety of electrophiles. Contrasting with other s&#8208;block metalating systems, which lack selectivity in their reactions even when operating at low temperatures, these mixed Li/Zn bases enabled unprecedented regioselectivities that cannot be replicated by either LiTMP nor Zn(TMP)2 on their own. Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.

Chemical modification of tin perovskites by biocompatible multidentate chelators realized &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; healing of structural imperfections and manipulation of carrier dynamics, delivering an efficiency up to 13.70&#8201;% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep&#8208;level defects in the perovskite film and under&#8208;optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2&#8208;Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep&#8208;level Sn&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with a small voltage deficit of &#8776;0.47&#8197;V has been achieved for the GAA&#8208;modified Sn&#8208;PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn&#8208;PSCs over 1200&#8197;hours.

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Photochemical 1,4&#8208;Bisalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene with Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective three&#8208;component photochemical 1,4&#8208;bisalkylation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene was achieved through synergistic palladium/copper catalysis. This transformation provided rapid access to &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing quaternary stereocenters in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies confirmed the involvement of excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis.







Abstract
Catalysis by excited&#8208;state palladium has emerged as an active area of research, but controlling the enantioselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis to accomplish the first three&#8208;component photochemical 1,4&#8208;bisalkylation reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. Consequently, &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing quaternary stereocenters were expeditiously synthesized from three simple starting materials: an alkyl bromide, butadiene, and an aldimine ester. Experimental and computational investigation of the reaction mechanism confirmed a radical pathway involving catalysis by an excited&#8208;state palladium species. The stereochemistry is mainly controlled by the chiral Cu catalyst.

         <title>Direct Dry Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts: A Study on Comminution and Alloying of Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic supported nanoparticles can be obtained by direct ball milling of the coarse powders of the metals and oxide support. The process was time&#8208;resolved via X&#8208;ray diffraction methods and electron microscopy so that a possible mechanism for the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles was developed. The study was extended to different systems, and it was found that final material features, like metal dispersion, can be predicted.







Abstract
Ball milling is growing increasingly important as an alternative synthetic tool to prepare catalytic materials. It was recently observed that supported metal catalysts could be directly obtained upon ball milling from the coarse powders of metal and oxide support. Moreover, when two compatible metal sources are simultaneously subjected to the mechanochemical treatment, bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained. A systematic investigation was extended to different metals and supports to understand better the mechanisms involved in the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles. Based on this, a model describing the role of metal&#8208;support interactions in the synthesis was developed. The findings will be helpful for the future rational design of supported metal catalysts via dry ball milling.

         <title>Highly Strained Bi&#8208;MOF on Bismuth Oxyhalide Support with Tailored Intermediate Adsorption/Desorption Capability for Robust CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF/BiOBr hybrid with high site&#8208;specific internal strain was engineered. The resulting alteration of p band center of the Bi nodes leads to a new (decreased) overlapping in the Bi 6p and CO2 (CO) 2p orbital hybridization. Therefore, favourable CO2 adsorption and accelerated dissociation of the *CO intermediate could be achieved, delivering high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoconversion efficiency.







Abstract
Herein, using as&#8208;designed surface&#8208;mounted Bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) on two&#8208;dimensional BiOBr support, as an operable platform for site&#8208;specific strain engineering to tailor the intermediate adsorption/desorption capability in CO2 photocatalytic conversion is proposed. Giant compressive strain up to 7.85&#8201;% is successfully induced on the surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF revealed by HRTEM images and geometric phase analysis as well as in situ Raman characterization, which largely downshifts the p band center of Bi nodes and intensifies their unsaturated state. In&#8208;depth explorations are put onto p&#8208;p (Bi 6p and CO2/CO 2p) orbital hybridization. Taking the adsorption process as an example, the 1&#960; and 7&#963; frontier molecule orbitals of CO2 2p for both the strain&#8208;free and strained models shift downwards the Fermi level, indicative of fast adsorption of CO2. Meanwhile, strain engineering further induces new non&#8208;degenerate orbital overlapping near 1&#960; and intensified overlapping of 7&#963; orbitals, stimulating the fast activation of absorbed CO2 molecules.

         <title>Direct Observation of Li&#8208;Ion Transport Heterogeneity Induced by Nanoscale Phase Separation in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes of Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
HAADF and in situ DPC&#8208;STEM were used to directly observe Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity caused by phase separation, which elucidates the reason for the capacity limitation of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials with high specific capacities could significantly enhance the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the specific practical capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs are extremely low due to poor initial activation. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy with in situ differential phase contrast imaging was first used to study the initial activation mechanism of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2. Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity was observed in LLO grains and across the LLO/Li6PS5Cl interface, due to the coexistence of the nanoscale Li2MnO3 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 phases. Consequently, the severely constrained activation of Li2MnO3 during the first charging could be attributed to a nanoscale phase separation in LLO, hindering Li&#8208;ion transport through its particles, and causing high impedance in the Li2MnO3 domain/Li6PS5Cl interface. This study could facilitate interface design of high&#8208;performance LLO&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Initiative Collision at Microelectrodes with Vertically Mobile Micromotors</title>

Biocatalytic metal&#8211;organic framework micromotors with controllable vertical motion are applied to electrochemical impact measurements, which offer a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and the particles and shed light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.







Abstract
Impact experiments enable single particle analysis for many applications. However, the effect of the trajectory of a particle to an electrode on impact signals still requires further exploration. Here, we investigate the particle impact measurements versus motion using micromotors with controllable vertical motion. With biocatalytic cascade reactions, the micromotor system utilizes buoyancy as the driving force, thus enabling more regulated interactions with the electrode. With the aid of numerical simulations, the dynamic interactions between the electrode and micromotors are categorized into four representative patterns: approaching, departing, approaching&#8208;and&#8208;departing, and departing&#8208;and&#8208;reapproaching, which correspond well with the experimentally observed impact signals. This study offers a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and particles, shedding light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Catalyst for the Fluorination of Acyl Chlorides at Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). The Co1&#8722;N4@NC catalyst generated a stable Co&#8722;F intermediate in situ through an oxidative fluorination pathway to replace the substitution fluorination of the unstable high&#8208;valent Co system. In the presence of Co&#8722;F intermediates, KF can be used to replace AgF. Co1&#8722;N4@NC exhibited ultrahigh catalytic activity for the fluorination of acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt&#8208;catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8722;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co1&#8722;N4@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high&#8208;valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale&#8208;up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON=1.58&#215;106). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for follow&#8208;up studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.

         <title>A CO2&#8208;Masked Carbene Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) decorated covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2) heterogeneous catalyst is prepared. COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 catalyzes the hydrosilylation of CO2 and the N&#8208;formylation of amines with CO2 to produce methanol and formamides. The activities rank COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 among the most active heterogeneous catalysts for these CO2 fixation reactions.







Abstract
Free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are generally prepared by treatment of imidazolium precursors with strong alkali reagents, which usually produces inactive NHC dimers. This treatment would destroy porous supports and thus make supported NHC catalysts difficult to recovery and reuse. Herein, we report the first stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) grafted on a porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF). The stable NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties in the COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 could be transformed in situ into isolated NHCs by heating, which exhibit superior catalytic performances in hydrosilylation and N&#8208;formylation reactions with CO2. The NHC sites can reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 and thus can be easily recycled and reused while maintaining excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations revealed that NHC sites can be fully exposed after removal of CO2&#8208;masks and rapidly react with silanes, which endows COF&#8208;NHC with high catalytic activity.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence of Perovskites with Reduced Dimensionality Achieved by Manipulating Adsorption&#8208;Energy Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have exemplified the critical role of adsorption&#8208;energy differences in the structural regulation of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites by complementing theoretical calculations and experiments. As a result, we achieved deep&#8208;blue PeLED peaking at 457&#8197;nm with a record EQE of 4.62&#8201;% accompanied by stable electroluminescent spectra. Our findings provide a way for PeLEDs to develop their full technological potential.







Abstract
The lagging development of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) heavily impedes their practical applications in full&#8208;color display due to the absence of spectrally stable emitters and the mismatch of carrier injection capacity. Herein, we report highly efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high&#8208;purify phase in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption&#8208;energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n&#8208;value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination. As a result, an external quantum efficiency of 4.62&#8201;% is achieved in PeLEDs with a stable EL peak at 457&#8197;nm, demonstrating the best reported result for deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs so far.

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Mediated &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acidic Diketones with ortho&#8208;Substituted Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular, bismacycle&#8208;mediated method is disclosed for the oxidative coupling of cyclic and fluoroalkyl diketones with ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. A wide range of functionality is tolerated on both partners, providing direct access to agrochemically and pharmaceutically important motifs that are currently inaccessible by other approaches.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic and fluoroalkyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is made challenging by the highly stabilized nature of the corresponding enolates, and is especially difficult for sterically demanding aryl partners. As a general solution to this problem, we report the Bi&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling of acidic diones and ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. Starting from a bench&#8208;stable bismacycle precursor, a sequence of B&#8208;to&#8208;Bi transmetallation, oxidation and C&#8722;C bond formation furnishes the arylated diones. Development of methodology that tolerates both sensitive functionality and steric demand is supported by interrogation of key reactive intermediates. Application of our strategy to cyclic diones enables the concise synthesis of important agrochemical intermediates which were previously prepared using toxic Pb reagents. This methodology also enables the first ever arylation of fluoroalkyl diones which, upon condensation with hydrazine, provides direct access to valuable fluoroalkyl pyrazoles.

         <title>Reconstruction of Highly Dense Cu&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Characterized by Operando Synchrotron Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando synchrotron radiation identifies the reconstruction process of highly dense Cu&#8722;N4 sites transforming to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and then to Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under potential&#8208;driver, which could regulate the d&#8208;band center of metal atom and balance the competition of rate&#8208;determining step for ORR, thus optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance.







Abstract
The emerging star of single atomic site (SAS) catalyst has been regarded as the most promising Pt&#8208;substituted electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the metal loading in SAS directly affects the whole device performance. Herein, we report a dual nitrogen source coordinated strategy to realize high dense Cu&#8722;N4 SAS with a metal loading of 5.61&#8197;wt% supported on 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes/graphene structure wherein simultaneously performs superior ORR activity and stability in alkaline media. When applied in H2/O2 AEMFC, it could reach an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.90&#8197;V and a peak power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Operando synchrotron radiation analyses identify the reconstruction from initial Cu&#8722;N4 to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and the subsequent Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under working conditions, which gradually regulate the d&#8208;band center of central metal and balance the Gibbs free energy of *OOH and *O intermediates, benefiting to ORR activity.

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;propelled microreactors producing chiral molecules with a high enantiomeric excess are proposed as a complementary approach with respect to classic stereoselective electroorganic synthesis. The straightforward concept is based on a spontaneous redox reaction occurring at the surface of zinc (micro)wires covered with chiral oligomers.







Abstract
The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.

         <title>Identification of a Novel Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Type IV IDO1 Inhibitor Chemotype</title>

         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;natural products are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by existing NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of the novel pseudo&#8208;NP class termed apoxidoles. Biological investigation revealed potent reduction of cellular kynurenine levels by apoxidoles through selective targeting of apo&#8208;indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (apo&#8208;IDO1).







Abstract
Natural product (NP)&#8208;inspired design principles provide invaluable guidance for bioactive compound discovery. Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) are de novo combinations of NP fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of apoxidoles, a novel pseudo&#8208;NP class, whereby indole&#8208; and tetrahydropyridine fragments are linked in monopodal connectivity not found in nature. Apoxidoles are efficiently accessible by an enantioselective [4+2] annulation reaction. Biological evaluation revealed that apoxidoles define a new potent type IV inhibitor chemotype of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a heme&#8208;containing enzyme considered a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration, autoimmunity and cancer. Apoxidoles target apo&#8208;IDO1, prevent heme binding and induce unique amino acid positioning as revealed by crystal structure analysis. Novel type IV apo&#8208;IDO1 inhibitors are in high demand, and apoxidoles may provide new opportunities for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage&#8208;Based Prodrug Activation Strategy Applied to &#946;&#8208;Lapachone for Cancer&#8208;Specific Targeting</title>

A C&#8722;C bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrug activation strategy is described and applied to &#946;&#8208;lapachone for cancer&#8208;specific targeting. The prodrug is activated through the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond and releases &#946;&#8208;lapachone for treating NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;overexpressing cancers. This strategy provides a valuable addition to the existing prodrug strategies.







Abstract
Prodrugs are one of the most common strategies for the design of targeted anticancer agents. However, their application is often hampered by the modifiable groups available on parent drugs. Herein, a carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrug activation strategy is reported, which was successfully used to design prodrugs of &#946;&#8208;lapachone (&#946;&#8208;lap), an ortho&#8208;quinone natural product without traditional modifiable groups for the construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrugs. The designed &#946;&#8208;lap prodrug with a reactive oxygen species&#8208;specific trigger was quickly activated, releasing &#946;&#8208;lap. It exerted anticancer efficacy via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;mediated futile redox cycling, resulting in potent cytotoxicity that was highly selective for NQO1&#8208;rich cancer cells over normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. This significantly amplified the therapeutic window of &#946;&#8208;lap. This study provides a practical strategy for the design of prodrugs for parent drugs that do not contain traditional modifiable groups.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Plus Reversible Supramolecular Adhesives Achieved by Regulating Intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new class of reversible supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive systems by integrating adhesive chains with cyclometalated platinum(II) units in the same covalent skeleton. By manipulating intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, the organoplatinum(II) adhesives exhibit stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa.







Abstract
Surface adhesion has a great contradiction in high strength and good reversibility given their mutually exclusive requirements of fixed crosslinked networks and dynamic chain motion. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive system regulated by intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions that can simultaneously achieve high&#8208;strength and excellent reversible adhesion to various substrates. Upon alternating temperature, the assembly of suitably substituted organoplatinum(II) molecules can switch between well&#8208;ordered and disordered states via tuning PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, resulting in stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa and a large on&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;25. Along with the switch of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII contacts, the surface adhesion of organoplatinum(II) adhesives can be monitored by their changes in electrical signals. This study will open up new inspirations for developing high&#8208;performance reversible adhesives.

         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde&#8208;derived iminium ions 1 form benzoxacyclic products 2 in a photochemical reaction cascade (n=0,1). Structurally different products 3 (meta photocycloaddition) and 4 (aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction) are observed depending on two key substituents (R, R1).







Abstract
While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955;=366&#8197;nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955;=420&#8197;nm, 2.5&#8197;mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a)&#8197;Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b)&#8197;If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a meta photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8211;79&#8201;% yield). (c)&#8197;If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and an azetidine was formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8211;98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale View of Protein&#8208;PEG Interactions that Redirect the Thermal Unfolding Pathway of PEGylated Human Galectin&#8208;3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylation of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human Galectin&#8208;3 dramatically redirected the protein thermal unfolding pathway. NMR spectroscopy showed PEG localized to the protein surface consistent with a &#8220;shroud&#8221; molecular model. Subtle changes in the PEG localization and corresponding thermal unfolding profiles were realized by replacing lysines near the protein&#8208;PEG interface.







Abstract
PEGylation is a promising approach to address the central challenge of applying biologics, i.e., lack of protein stability in the demanding environment of the human body. Wider application is hindered by lack of atomic level understanding of protein&#8208;PEG interactions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties. We deployed an integrative structural and biophysical approach to address this critical challenge with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cell adhesion and potential biologic. PEGylation dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability, forming a stable intermediate and redirecting its unfolding pathway. Structural details revealed by NMR pointed to a potential role of PEG localization facilitated by charged residues. Replacing these residues subtly altered the protein&#8208;PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing insight into rationally designing conjugates while preserving PEGylation benefits.

         <title>Phase Separation of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 upon Specific RNA&#8208;Binding Observed by Magnetic Resonance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble model of free dispersed full&#8208;length heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was generated from magnetic resonance data based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling and from a small&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering curve. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with this model provides insight into the interplay of specific single&#8208;stranded RNA recognition by hnRNP A1 and its liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.







Abstract
Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single&#8208;stranded RNA and its relation to liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) were studied in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low&#8208;complexity domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid&#8208;droplet formation. Such LLPS depended on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that an interplay of sequence&#8208;specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation of specific RNA segregation during stress response.

         <title>The Origin of High&#8208;Voltage Stability in Single&#8208;Crystal Layered Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The drastic H2/H3 phase transition and destructive H3b phase formation presented in PC electrode are effectively suppressed in SC cathodes when cycling at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, in which the origin of excellent high&#8208;voltage stability in single&#8208;crystal was clearly clarified.







Abstract
Compared with the polycrystal (PC) Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, the single&#8208;crystal (SC) counterpart displayed excellent structural stability, high reversible capacity and limited voltage decay during cycling, which received great attention from academics and industry. However, the origin of fascinating high&#8208;voltage stability within SC is poorly understood yet. Herein, we tracked the evolution of phase transitions, in which the destructive volume change and H3 phase formation presented in PC, are effectively suppressed in SC when cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, further clarifying the origin of high&#8208;voltage stability in SC cathode. Moreover, SC electrode displayed crack&#8208;free morphology, and excellent electrochemical stability during long&#8208;term cycling, whereas PC suffered severe capacity and voltage fade because of the spinel&#8208;like phase, decoding the failure mechanisms of PC and SC during cycling at high cut&#8208;off voltages. This finding provides universal insights into high&#8208;voltage stability and failure mechanisms of layered Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Phen&#8208;DC3 Induces Refolding of Human Telomeric DNA into a Chair&#8208;Type Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex through Ligand Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phen&#8208;DC3 is one of the most widely used specific G&#8208;quadruplex ligands. This work reveals that Phen&#8208;DC3 intercalates in an antiparallel chair&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex adopted by human telomeric sequence, with the ligand positioned between two G&#8208;quartets on the one side, and a dynamic yet fully formed G&#8208;quartet capped by a T&#8208;A&#8208;A triad on the other side.







Abstract
Human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target's polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen&#8208;DC3, one of the most prominent G&#8208;quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)3 to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid&#8208;1 to an antiparallel chair&#8208;type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two&#8208;quartet unit and a pseudo&#8208;quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high&#8208;resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex.

This work reveals that Phen-DC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intercalates in an antiparallel chair-type G-quadruplex adopted by human telomeric sequence, with the ligand positioned between two G-quartets on the one side, and a dynamic yet fully formed G-quartet capped by a T-A-A triad on the other side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target's polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen-DC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, one of the most prominent G-quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid-1 to an antiparallel chair-type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two-quartet unit and a pseudo-quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high-resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G-quadruplex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent CO2 Activation by Tuning the Lewis Acid in Iron&#8208;Based Bimetallic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting CO2 activation reactivity using bimetallic Fe0/Lewis acid combinations is reported. The use of gold promotes irreversible CO2/N2 exchange, whereas push&#8208;pull CO2 fixation structures emerge from the use of acidic zinc and borane compounds. The use of an alane, Al(C6F5)3, promotes bimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Computational studies support the observed divergent reactivity and substantiate the bonding scenario.







Abstract
Bimetallic motifs mediate the selective activation and functionalization of CO2 in metalloenzymes and some recent synthetic systems. In this work, we build on the nascent concept of bimetallic frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to investigate the activation and reduction of CO2. Using the Fe0 fragment [(depe)2Fe] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) as base, we modify the nature of the partner Lewis acid to accomplish a divergent and highly chemoselective reactivity towards CO2. [Au(PMe2Ar)]+ irreversibly dissociates CO2, Zn(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3 yield different CO2 adducts stabilized by push&#8208;pull interactions, while Al(C6F5)3 leads to a rare heterobimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and thus to contrasting reduced products after exposure to dihydrogen. Computational investigations provide a rationale for the divergent reactivity, while Energy Decomposition Analysis&#8208;Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) method substantiates the heterobimetallic bonding situation.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of Methyl Esters and CO in Lignin Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete utilization of lignin: the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates (applied to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals), and the remaining carbon atoms of lignin react with oxygen to form CO predominantly, which may be used directly in carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
Lignin is an abundant renewable carbon source. Due to its complex structure, utilization of lignin is very challenging. Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the simultaneous utilization of lignin, in which the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates and the other alkyl and phenyl carbons react with oxygen to predominantly form CO that can be used directly in carbonylation reactions. The method was applied to the methylation of various functionalized aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids, including natural compounds, to produce valuable chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. No solid or liquid residues remain after the reaction. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that a well&#8208;ordered C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond activation sequence takes place to realize total transformation of lignin. This work opens a way for transformation of the entire lignin polymer into valuable products, exemplified by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical, Ramipril, on a gram scale.

         <title>Cobaloxime Photocatalysis for the Synthesis of Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime was employed as the sole photocatalyst in the cyclization phosphorylation of isocyanides and Csp2&#8722;H phosphorylation. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, a series of phosphorus&#8208;substituted phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines, and common heteroaromatics were obtained in good to excellent yields without any aid of electrolysis, metal reductants, or oxidants, and with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct.







Abstract
Herein, cobaloxime is used for the first time as a catalyst for the synthesis of phosphorylated heteroaromatics, which is an intriguing and versatile functional motif. With visible&#8208;light irradiation, cobaloxime not only oxidizes phosphine oxides to form phosphorus radicals (P&#8208;radicals) for a subsequent reaction with radical acceptor isocyanides or heteroaromatics, but also combines the radical intermediate with &#946;&#8208;H elimination, thereby producing phosphorylated heteroaromatics with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct. Phosphine oxides with dialkyl, alkylaryl, and diaryl substituents could be directly transformed into phosphorylated phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines, and common heteroaromatics. This catalytic system features extremely mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields. Scale&#8208;up reaction and sunlight reaction show the great application potential in the green synthesis of important organophosphorus chemicals.

A photothermally selective AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP laminated nanofiber film with Janus structure is prepared by fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly method. The two sides of AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP reveal different photothermal performances. Such lightweight, breathable and conductive nanofiber&#8208;hybrid textile enables applications in thermoregulatory garments that possess the performances of heat preservation in winter and cooling in summer.







Abstract
Given health threat by global warming and increased energy consumption in regulating body temperature, it is an urgent need to construct smart temperature&#8208;regulating materials. Herein, a novel fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly (FACA) method is proposed to construct nanofiber materials with asymmetric photothermal properties. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) with opposite thermal radiation are assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film, imparting AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP film with Janus structure that can realize the AgNWs side consistently keeps temperature of ca. 11&#8201;&#176;C lower than the side of PVDF&#8208;HFP nanofiber regardless of the irradiation directions under 1 sun, suggesting the adjustable photothermal regulation. Such photothermally selective hybrid nanofiber film provides great potential as fabrics to achieve all&#8208;weather smart clothes, promoting controllable and comprehensive utilization of solar energy.

Small but effective: only few small additives are potent antiscalants, extremely solubilizing CaCO3. These underlying molecular mechanisms act beyond standard concepts of nucleation inhibition: they trigger, stabilize, and feed PNCs, presetting key properties of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). This study reveals how small molecules may co&#8208;regulate biomineralization and breaks grounds for sustainable antiscalants.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW) additives can strongly impact amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), playing an elusive role in biogenic, geologic, and industrial calcification. Here, we present molecular mechanisms by which these additives regulate stability and composition of both CaCO3 solutions and solid ACC. Potent antiscalants inhibit ACC precipitation by interacting with prenucleation clusters (PNCs); they specifically trigger and integrate into PNCs or feed PNC growth actively. Only PNC&#8208;interacting additives are traceable in ACC, considerably stabilizing it against crystallization. The selective incorporation of potent additives in PNCs is a reliable chemical label that provides conclusive chemical evidence that ACC is a molecular PNC&#8208;derived precipitate. Our results reveal additive&#8208;cluster interactions beyond established mechanistic conceptions. They reassess the role of small&#8208;MW molecules in crystallization and biomineralization while breaking grounds for new sustainable antiscalants.

         <dc:description>
The first example of a double&#8208;helical metal&#8208;chain metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8) is prepared. It shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The highly conjugated ZUT&#8208;8 structure was introduced into a cathodic metal&#8208;protection system where it significantly decreases metal corrosion.







Abstract
The development of novel metal organic framework (MOF) friction power generation materials with high stability is important. This paper reports the first example of a double&#8208;helix metal chain organic framework with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8). ZUT&#8208;8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT&#8208;8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker. The theoretical calculation results showed that an increase in the degree of conjugation could significantly reduce the band gap, thereby affecting the friction power output signal. This study opens the door to constructing MOF materials with a double&#8208;helix metal chain and will promote their potential applications in self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.

         <title>Enantioselective para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization of Alkyl Benzene Derivatives via Cooperative Catalysis of Gold/Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid
</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of non&#8208;activated arenes via cooperative catalysis is disclosed. The strategy merges gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) in the synthesis of a variety of chiral diaryl esters with high site&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkyl benzene derivatives was successfully developed via cooperative catalysis of gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), leading to synthetically useful chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs. Chiral phosphoric acid, ligand, and molecular sieves were found to be crucial for enantioselectivity control of this transformation. The salient features of this protocol include mild conditions, high efficiency, commercially available starting materials, highly chemo&#8208; and site&#8208; as well as enantioselective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization, broad substrate scope, and extensive applications of the chiral products. The mechanistic studies suggested that two CPAs might be involved in chiral induction.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover and Its Relation to Hydrogenation: Observations on Structurally Defined Single&#8208;Atom Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to common belief, hydrogen spillover can be either beneficial or detrimental to the catalytic performance of hydrogenation catalysts. This was determined through in&#8208;depth studies of structurally well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom catalysts as well as conventional Pt/WO3.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the transfer of H atoms from metal sites onto the catalyst support, is ubiquitous in chemical processes such as catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogen storage. Atomic level information concerning the kinetics of this process, the structural evolution of catalysts during hydrogen spillover, as well as the nature of participation of the spilled over H in catalysis, remain vastly lacking. Here, we provide insights to those questions with a solubilized polyoxometalate&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalyst which allows for the use of characterization techniques generally inaccessible to the study of heterogeneous catalysts. Hydrogenation kinetics together with poisoning studies further reveal that hydrogen spillover can be either detrimental or beneficial for catalysis, the direction and magnitude of which depends mostly on the nature of the reducible functional group. Similar trends were observed on one of the most prototypical hydrogen spillover catalysts&#8212;Pt/WO3.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence Duality in Tetracationic Binaphthyl&#8208;Based Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetracationic enantiopure cyclophanes have been synthesized by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. These highly charged fluorescent cyclophanes exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emissions and display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state.







Abstract
Here, we report an approach to the synthesis of highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. Remarkably, these fluorescent tetracationic cyclophanes exhibit a significant AIE compared to their neutral optically active binaphthyl precursors. A combination of theoretical calculations and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the AIE originates from limited torsional vibrations associated with the axes of chirality present in the chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl units and the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic landscape when incorporated within the cyclophane structure. Furthermore, these highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state. This unique duality of AIE and CPL in these tetracationic cyclophanes is destined to be of major importance in future development of photonic devices and bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>What Matters for a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant?</title>

This Viewpoint Article provides tips on how to increase the chances of securing a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant.







Abstract
European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grants are arguably the most competitive grants in Europe and their prestige is fully justified considering that they (i) allow focus on a high risk/high gain project through generous funding of 1.5&#8211;2&#8197;million Euros, (ii) they can enable the foundation of a new academic group and earn the submitting principal investigator a professorship, and (iii) they serve as a highly reputable award that can either facilitate tenure/promotion or assist in securing a subsequent academic position. However, the journey to getting one is far from easy. In this Viewpoint Article, I will discuss my first two unsuccessful attempts to secure an ERC Starting Grant and how the lessons learned during the process led me to ultimately secure a grant upon my third attempt.

Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a pivotal precursor in biomineralization, central to geological and industrial calcification. Some small organic molecules have the ability to affect ACC formation, composition, and stability powerfully. In their Research Article (e202208475), Asher Schmidt, Dirk Zahn, Stephan&#8197;E. Wolf et&#8197;al. decode the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate both prenucleation cluster and solution composition and proceed outside the established conceptional framework.

Enter stereogradient PLA: A tripodal zirconium complex catalyzes the polymerization of L&#8208;lactide contaminated with meso&#8208;lactide to yield stereogradient poly(lactic acid) (PLA), as described by Moshe Kol and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202207652). The stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers derived from tin octanoate, and may alleviate the need for L&#8208;lactide purification.

Grafting N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on porous materials to realize high activity and recyclability is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202207478), Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang, Rong Cao, and co&#8208;workers describe the development of a facile method for utilizing NHC sites generated in&#8197;situ from CO2&#8208;masked precursors anchored on a covalent organic framework (COF) for sustainable catalytic CO2 conversion. The NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties can be transformed into NHC sites by heating in a catalytic process, in which the CO2 molecules mask the NHC sites and reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 after catalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels as well as recent advances form the focus of this Minireview. The feasibility of these bio&#8208;inspired channels for exploring physiological events, the detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion is presented along with prospects for the future development of this vibrant field.







Abstract
Highly efficient biological ion channels with sophisticated transport characteristics in living organisms have inspired the design of artificial channels that are functionally comparable to those of their natural counterparts and applicable on a much larger scale. Self&#8208;assembly currently offers a facile approach for producing nanoconfined ion channels that exhibit smart ion&#8208;transport properties, including ion selectivity, gating, and rectification, and have shown great potential for various applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of strategies for engineering bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels. We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem&#8208;based fabrication, and polymer&#8208;based integration. The applications of these bio&#8208;inspired channels in the exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion are concisely presented. Finally, future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.

The possibility of generating unidirectional, controlled rotary motion by chemical conversion is a major challenge. This Review provides an overview of approaches to the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of various classes of atropisomers that can perform controlled switching or directional rotational motion under the influence of a chemical stimulus. Future strategies and challenges for the development of autonomous molecular motors are also provided.







Abstract
Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are major steps towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this Review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized as molecular switches, rotors, motors, and autonomous motors according to their type of response. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.

         <title>Design and Growth of Branched Organic Crystals: Recent Advances and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional hierarchical organic crystals with branched architectures are suitable fundamental building blocks in integrated photonic devices because of their inherent multichannel characteristics for the efficient generation and processing of optical signals. This Review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis and photonic applications of organic branched crystals as well as the challenges and prospects for their future development.







Abstract
The rapid development of information technology has resulted in a growing demand for low&#8208;dimensional photonic materials. Organic semiconductor materials play an important role in various photonic devices due to their adjustable physicochemical properties, while individual organic crystals do not exhibit the desired performance due to the limitations of their simple structure. Branched organic crystals with inherent multichannel characteristics based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are favorable components in optoelectronics. However, the preparation of branched organic crystals still faces great challenges before they can be applied in integrated optoelectronic devices. In this Review, the development and representative examples of branched organic crystals in terms of molecular design, synthesis, and advanced applications are discussed. We also provide a summary and outlook for the direction of future research on branched organic crystals as excellent candidates in photonic integrated circuits.

Organic semiconductor materials play an important role in various photonic devices due to their adjustable physicochemical properties, while individual organic crystals do not exhibit the desired performance due to the limitations of their simple structure. Branched organic crystals with inherent multichannel characteristics based on &#960;-conjugated molecules are favorable components in optoelectronics. However, the preparation of branched organic crystals still faces great challenges before they can be applied in integrated optoelectronic devices. In this Review, the development and representative examples of branched organic crystals in terms of molecular design, synthesis, and advanced applications are discussed. We also provide a summary and outlook for the direction of future research on branched organic crystals as excellent candidates in photonic integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Formation of B&#8722;N Bonds for BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Multiple Resonance Emitters with Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access multiple resonance (MR) emitter is constructed by simplifying multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds, while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned N atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, m[B&#8208;N]N1 and m[B&#8208;N]N2, exhibit impressive maximum EQE values of 36.0&#8201;% and 33.4&#8201;%, with narrowband emissions at 480 and 486&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of only 26 and 32&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable multiple resonance (MR) optoelectronic properties of organic nanographenes with boron and nitrogen atoms disposed para to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490&#8197;nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34&#8197;nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of &gt;33.0&#8201;%, which remained above 24.0&#8201;% even at a high brightness of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first example of MR emitters with a B&#8722;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Over Atomically Dispersed Synergistic Ni/Co Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (a&#8208;NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are synthesized through a templated assisted atom migration&#8208;trapping route. Due to the delicately designed dual&#8208;metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the a&#8208;NiCo/NC electrocatalyst exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance compared with atomically dispersed single&#8208;metal&#8208;site counterparts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are being pursued as economical electrocatalysts. However, their low active&#8208;site loading, poor interactions, and unclear catalytic mechanism call for significant advances. Herein, atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (a&#8208;NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the obtained a&#8208;NiCo/NC sample exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and kinetics towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong synergistic interactions from heteronuclear paired Ni/Co dual sites lead to the optimization of the electronic structure and the reduced reaction energy barrier. This work provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;efficiency atomically dispersed dual&#8208;site SACs in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Azoarenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Silicon&#8208;Masked Diazenyl Anions and (Hetero)Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric azobenzene derivatives by an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling is presented. N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;silyldiazenes are employed as diazenyl anion equivalents that can be selectively coupled under palladium catalysis with a large array of (hetero)aryl bromides in high yields. The functional&#8208;group tolerance on either (hetero)aryl ring is excellent.







Abstract
The photoswitchable motif of azobenzenes is of great importance across the life and materials sciences. This maintains a constant demand for their efficient synthesis, especially that of non&#8208;symmetric derivatives. We disclose here a general strategy for their synthesis through an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling where functionalized aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes masked with a silyl group are employed as diazenyl pronucleophiles. These equivalents of fragile diazenyl anions couple with a diverse set of (hetero)aryl bromides under palladium catalysis with no loss of dinitrogen. The competing denitrogenative biaryl formation is fully suppressed. The reaction requires only a minimal excess, that is 1.2 equivalents, of the diazenyl component. By this, a broad range of azoarenes decorated with two electron&#8208;rich/deficient aryl groups can be accessed in a predictable way with superb functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation with a Carbon&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst and Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation can be achieved over a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon nitride, in which hydrogen protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are sequentially added to various unsaturated bonds. In&#8208;depth characterization confirms the direct hydrogenation mechanism and links the outstanding performance to reduced barriers for hydrogenation and accelerated proton supply from water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds has received considerable attention in the research area of sustainable organic synthesis; however, water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen, has rarely been investigated due to the high barrier associated with splitting of water molecules. We report a carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst with unparalleled performance in photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation compared to its nanoparticle counterparts. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments and operando nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirm the direct hydrogenation mechanism using in situ&#8208;generated protons from water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Density functional theory calculations attribute the high activity to lower barriers for hydrogenation, facilitated desorption of ethylbenzene, and facile hydrogen replenishment from water on the atomic palladium sites.

The dideoxy analogs are found to exhibit remarkable in cellulo and in vitro properties, are stable against degradation by poxvirus immune nucleases, and exhibit superior tumor growth control in a mouse model.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP is a cyclic A&#8208; and G&#8208;containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferons and cytokines. The development of STING&#8208;binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumor or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP (1) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary ribose&#8208;OH groups, form a group of poxin&#8208;stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cAAMP (2), features an unusually high antitumor response in mice.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Isolation of An Aza&#8208;Triangulene and Its Cation in Crystalline Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene and its cation were synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. The cation is an isoelectronic structure of triangulene, showing a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of about 0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (i.e., aza&#8208;triangulene) (NT) and its cation (NT+) in single&#8208;crystal form. Notably, the cation NT+ can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all&#8208;carbon triangulene. Both NT and NT+ show reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral NT has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation NT+ exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of +0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This study provides a rational strategy to access high&#8208;spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Stereoselective Three&#8208;Step One&#8208;Pot Cascade Combining Amino&#8208; and Biocatalysis to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Nitro Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic cascades offer a simple and efficient way to rapidly build structural complexity. A three&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process is reported in which a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;mediated asymmetric conjugate addition, and a bioreduction step were combined to access chiral nitro alcohols from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives in good overall yields and excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The combination of small&#8208;molecule catalysis and enzyme catalysis represents an underexploited area of research with huge potential in asymmetric synthetic chemistry due to both compatibility of reaction conditions and complementary reactivity. Herein, we describe the telescopic synthesis of chiral nitro alcohols starting from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives through the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade combination of a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysed asymmetric conjugate addition, and ketoreductase&#8208;mediated reduction to access the corresponding target compounds in moderate to excellent overall isolated yields (36&#8211;80&#8201;%) and high diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios (up to &gt;97&#8201;:&#8201;3). This represents the first example of the combination of an organocatalysed asymmetric conjugate addition via iminium ion activation and a bioreduction step catalysed by ketoreductases.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol over a Carbon&#8208;Coated CuOx Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;coated CuOx catalyst achieves a remarkable ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 46&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, substantially higher than those over most reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. The surface carbon coating can effectively stabilize the abundant Cu+ species, thus facilitate C&#8722;C coupling by improving *CO adsorption, and tune the key intermediate *HOCCH in the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.







Abstract
The design of efficient copper(Cu)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for CO2 electroreduction into multiple carbon products. However, most Cu&#8208;based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains a great challenge. Herein, we design a carbon&#8208;coated CuOx (CuOx@C) catalyst through one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), which exhibits high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with Faradaic efficiency of 46&#8201;%. Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than that of most reported catalysts. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon coating can efficiently stabilize Cu+ species under CO2 electroreduction conditions, which promotes the C&#8722;C coupling step. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the carbon layer can tune the key intermediate *HOCCH goes the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.

         <title>Tuning the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Polymerization through Cocrystallization of the Monomer with an Inert Isostere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the regioselectivity of topochemical reactions is challenging as they occur under reagent&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Employing a cocrystal strategy, we rationally tuned the regiochemistry of a topochemical polymerization. A monomer, known to polymerize topochemically to give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of two differently linked polymers, was cocrystallized with a dummy molecule. This cocrystal underwent topochemical polymerization regioselectively.







Abstract
Regiochemistry of topochemical reactions depends on the crystal packing and biasing the regiochemistry necessitates precise crystal engineering. The pristine crystals of monomer 1 upon topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymers due to the presence of two self&#8208;sorted reactive conformers in the crystal. We designed a binary isomorphous cocrystal of monomer 1 and a structurally similar dummy molecule 2 to limit the number of reactive conformers of 1 to one and thus to get one type of polymer. Equimolar solution of 1 and 2 in chloroform&#8208;acetone mixture gave two 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals Co&#8208;I and Co&#8208;II. The Co&#8208;II, a chloroform adduct, on heating undergoes desolvation and polymorphic transition to Co&#8208;I. Co&#8208;I is isomorphic to 1 and 2 and possess self&#8208;sorted arrays of 1 and 2. Heating Co&#8208;I results in the TAAC polymerization giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer of 1 selectively, showing the power of crystal engineering in regiocontrol.

The pristine crystals of monomer &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; upon topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of 1,4- and 1,5-triazole-linked polymers due to the presence of two self-sorted reactive conformers in the crystal. We designed a binary isomorphous cocrystal of monomer &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and a structurally similar dummy molecule &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to limit the number of reactive conformers of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to one and thus to get one type of polymer. Equimolar solution of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in chloroform-acetone mixture gave two 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals &lt;b&gt;Co-I&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Co-II&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;b&gt;Co-II&lt;/b&gt;, a chloroform adduct, on heating undergoes desolvation and polymorphic transition to &lt;b&gt;Co-I&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Co-I&lt;/b&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and possess self-sorted arrays of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Heating &lt;b&gt;Co-I&lt;/b&gt; results in the TAAC polymerization giving 1,4-triazolyl-linked polymer of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; selectively, showing the power of crystal engineering in regiocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fano Resonance in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers the first direct observation of the Fano resonance effect in single&#8208;molecule junctions by the charge injection on the nitrogen atom using an EC&#8208;STM&#8208;BJ technique at room temperature, which provides a facile way to manipulate electron tunneling in the single&#8208;molecule junctions and opens a new avenue toward the design of interference&#8208;based molecular electronic devices.







Abstract
The Fano resonance in single&#8208;molecule junctions could be created by interaction with discrete and continuous molecular orbitals and enables effective electron transport modulation between constructive and destructive interference within a small energy range. However, direct observation of Fano resonance remains unexplored because of the disappearance of discrete orbitals by molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We demonstrated the room&#8208;temperature observation of Fano resonance from electrochemical gated single&#8208;molecule conductance and current&#8211;voltage measurements of a para&#8208;carbazole anion junction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the negative charge on the nitrogen atom induces a localized HOMO on the molecular center, creating Fano resonance by interfering with the delocalized LUMO on the molecular backbone. Our findings demonstrate that the Fano resonance in electron transport through single&#8208;molecule junctions opens pathways for designs of interference&#8208;based electronic devices.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Donor&#8208;Acceptor Strategy Enables Fast Spin&#8208;Flip of Multiple Resonance Emitters for Suppressing Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

A &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy is presented to boost the kRISC of multiple resonance emitters to &#8764;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a high EQEmax of 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have experienced great success in assembling narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of MR&#8208;emitters (103&#8211;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) that will lead to severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off has received extensive attention and remains a challenging issue. Herein, we put forward a &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy to accelerate RISC process. The introduction of SCDA units onto the MR&#8208;skeleton induces intermediate triplet states, which leads to a multichannel RISC process and thus increases kRISC. As illustrated examples, efficient MR&#8208;emitters have been developed with a sub&#8208;microsecond delayed lifetime and a high kRISC of 2.13&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Direct Arene Trifluoromethylation Enabled by a High&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound enables direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes for the first time. Thermolysis of CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond provides concurrently CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant, which synergistically engage in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. This study establishes an unprecedented fundamental reactivity of CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds, and thus represents a significant progress for CuIII chemistry.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds have often been invoked in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound is disclosed for the first time. The CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound serves CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond, which engage synergistically in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. The presence of K2S2O8 co&#8208;oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late&#8208;stage functionalization. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and CuIII chemistry.

         <title>Electronic Character of &#945;,3&#8208;Dehydrotoluene Intermediates Generated from Isolable Allenyne&#8208;Containing Substrates</title>

         <dc:description>
&#945;,3&#8208;Dehydroluenes (DHT), a relatively rare class of reactive intermediate(s), can be formed by warming isolable allenynes bearing a remote alkyne or nitrile. The product distributions produced in solvents of different polarity give insight to the electronic nature/structure of the DHTs (zwitterion vs. diradical vs. cyclic allene).







Abstract
We report here the generation of &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluenes, a relatively rare subset of reactive intermediates of the dehydroaromatic family, from isolable allenynes. The substructure motif in the allenyne substrates is distinct from, and complementary to, those found in Myers&#8208;Saito/Schmittel&#8208;type cycloisomerizations. The reactions reported here give rise to product profiles that provide insight about the electronic nature (i.e., diradical vs. zwitterion vs. cyclic allene) of the particular isomeric DHT(s) that is(are) produced under different reaction conditions differing most significantly in the polarity of the reaction solvent. One example also revealed previously unobserved carbene&#8208;like reactivity of the DHT.

         <title>Bright and Photostable Fluorescent Metal Nanocluster Supraparticles from Invert Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are formed by drying the water droplets in invert emulsions, resulting in a profoundly enhanced photoluminescence emission and resistance to photobleaching. The supraparticle structure greatly enhances the performance, where the inhibition of the twisted intermolecular charge transfer is one of the responsible causes.







Abstract
Fluorescent supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are synthesized by simply drying of invert emulsions, resulting in a dozen&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (up to &#8776;80&#8201;%) and a significant improvement in photostability. The inhibition of the ligand twisting during the intramolecular charge transfer is found to be responsible for the enhancement, especially for the gold nanocluster supraparticles. This research provides a general, flexible, and easy method for producing highly luminescent and photostable metal nanocluster&#8208;based materials that promise practical applications in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Acrylamides via Lewis&#8208;Base&#8208;Mediated Aryl/Hydrogen Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DABCO&#8208;induced polar aryl migration allows for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides from sulfonyl acrylimides. This reaction proceeds through a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange, including SO2 loss. A range of valuable building blocks have been synthesised and the underlying reaction mechanism has been explored using quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides leveraging polar S&#8208;to&#8208;C aryl migrations induced by a Lewis basic organocatalyst. In contrast to previously reported radical aryl migrations of sulfonyl acrylimides, this polar process enables subsequent elimination, ultimately leading to a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange including SO2 extrusion. This reaction is selective for electron&#8208;deficient aromatic groups, while tolerating a variety of substituents on nitrogen and in the &#946;&#8208;position, and it delivers useful building blocks for further transformations, including cycloaddition and cyclisation reactions. The mechanism was investigated in detail using quantum chemical calculations, which unexpectedly revealed the Lewis base to be involved in several decisive steps.

         <title>pH&#8208;Induced Symmetry Conversion of DNA Origami Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motifs, like i&#8208;motif sequence, can be inserted into prescribed dimensions through strict dimensional manipulation strategy, to trigger in situ reversible expansion and shrinkage in 3D DNA origami frameworks.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has provided credible approaches for assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lattices with complex patterns. However, the symmetries are strictly dependent on their initial configurations and difficult to alter via non&#8208;thermal treatments. While switchable nucleic acid structures have been employed to construct deformable DNA motifs, it remains challenging to arrange them anisotropically in 3D lattices to trigger directed collective shape transition and dynamic symmetry conversion. In this work, we used octahedral DNA origami frames to synthesize four DNA origami lattices by placing the pH&#8208;reactive i&#8208;motif sequences in the desired dimensions. Thereinto, lattices with an anisotropic design can switch between simple cubic (SC) and simple tetragonal (ST) upon pH change. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results reveal the feasibility of obtaining 3D lattices with sensitive responses to external stimuli, expanding the way to obtain low&#8208;symmetry lattices.

         <dc:description>
Robust mononuclear AuI emitters are prepared by harnessing intramolecular Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions. The new emitter displays appealing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as well as thermal and photo&#8208;stability, leading to high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off and good operational stability. This work shows the potential of secondary interactions for developing optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes which display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). A highly rigid and groove&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;donating aryl ligand has been used to form dual Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal&#8208;ligand interactions have been authenticated by single&#8208;crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF AuI complex exhibits appealing emission properties (photoluminescence quantum yield=76&#8201;%; delayed fluorescence lifetime=1.2&#8197;&#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo&#8208;stability. Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. An estimated LT50 longer than 77&#8201;000&#8197;h with initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 reveals good operational stability. This work suggests a way for design of stable luminescent gold(I) complexes.

         <title>A Rebuilding&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Strategy Enables Ultrasensitive Genotyping, N&#8208;in&#8208;1 Logic Screening and Accurate Multiplex Assay of Dangerous Pathogens</title>

         <dc:description>

Abstract
Sensitive, rapid and low&#8208;cost nucleic acid detection is critical for controlling infectious pathogens. Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides &#8776;zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45&#8197;copy/&#956;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221; OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.

Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross-interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ca2+:Cu2+ A&#8208;site Order in a Ferrimagnetic Double Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaCuFeReO6 adopts the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. Ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins is observed at TC=567&#8197;K and the magnetoresistance displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases.







Abstract
Cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO6 with the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO6 occurs in the same phase field as CaCu3Fe2Re2O12 demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO6 has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below TC=567&#8197;K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO6 displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8242;=Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for this family.

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 splitting is achieved with a simple Mo complex at a carbon electrode. Controlled reduction (a 3 electron transfer process) at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (vs. SCE) and ambient conditions (room T and atmospheric P) afforded a Mo nitride complex in 30&#8201;% yield. DFT studies support the transient formation of a MoI&#8722;N2&#8722;MoI bridging dimer.







Abstract
Nitrogen reduction under mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently been shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. We report electrochemical N2 splitting with a MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which is confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reductions of the starting Mo species, coordination of a N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT studies support the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) conversion studies of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids to Derivatize or Degrade Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acid side chains in macromolecules was explored as a robust post&#8208;polymerization modification strategy. Multiple transformations of copolymers were achieved, including derivatization with olefin units, functionalization with pendent alkenes, and backbone degradation. These decarboxylative processes were rapid, selective, and displayed high atom economy.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;mediated direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acids with an acridine photocatalyst is a convenient and powerful method to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals in polymer chains. Advantageously, this process proceeds under mild conditions, without preactivation of the acid groups. We utilize decarboxylation in the presence of a hydrogen atom donor to form statistical acrylate&#8208;ethylene and acrylate&#8208;propylene copolymers, which are challenging to obtain by direct polymerization. We additionally show that decarboxylation of methacrylic acid units within polymethacrylates can trigger degradation of the polymer backbones. Moreover, a dual catalytic approach, which combines the function of an acridine photocatalyst with that of a cobaloxime catalyst, is leveraged to furnish unique copolymers with pendent alkenes. Our work indicates that direct decarboxylation is a versatile technique for the synthesis of functional materials with tailored compositions and properties.

         <title>Integrating Light&#8208;Harvesting Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based Units into Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional metal covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs) with stp topology were constructed by integrating ruthenium(II)&#8208;based units in the skeleton, which exhibited superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
Three metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely RuCOF&#8208;ETTA, RuCOF&#8208;TPB and RuCOF&#8208;ETTBA, were synthesized by incorporating the photosensitive RuII tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) unit into the skeleton. Interestingly, each RuCOF contains three isostructural covalent organic frameworks that interlock together with the RuII centers serving as point of registry. The covalently linked network coupling with uniformly distributed RuII units allowed the RuCOFs to exhibit superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, and high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work illustrates the potential of developing versatile MCOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts from functionalized metal complex building unit and further enriches the MCOFs family.

         <title>Proton Chemistry Induced Long&#8208;Cycle Air Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) battery was developed in acidic electrolyte. The Pb/PTO batteries display excellent cycle stability during repeated self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging process because the self&#8208;charging behavior in acidic medium can effectively avoid the formation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrode.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries usually suffer from capacity loss after self&#8208;charging cycles due to the formation of basic salts on cathodes in the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries based on proton chemistry are developed in acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of H+ uptake/removal endows the battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. Owing to the high standard electrode potential of oxygen in acid electrolyte, the discharged cathodes are spontaneously oxidized by oxygen in air along with H+ extraction and thus achieve self&#8208;charging without external power supply. Notably, the air self&#8208;charging mechanism involved H+&#8208;based redox can effectively avoid the generation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrodes and thus guarantee long&#8208;term self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles of Pb/PTO batteries. This work provides a promising strategy for designing long&#8208;cycle air self&#8208;charging systems.

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;couplings follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that were reported to undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretic and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible&#8208;light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;couplings. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give Sn(II) systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two V donor ligand set to a mixed V&#8208;donor / S&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Molecular Springs with Varying Spring Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general synthetic route toward freeform helical ladder polymers with&#160; varying &#160;spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal&#160;  1  H NMR relaxation times (  T  1  ) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with&#160; varying mechanical properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a general synthetic route toward freeform helical ladder polymers with&#160; varying &#160;spring constants, built with chirality-assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape-persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs.

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture restricted potential applications. Here, we report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into LaN lattice that form La&#8208;Al metallic bond (La&#8208;Al&#8208;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting  TM  /La&#8208;Al&#8208;N (  TM  = Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported  TM  /LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8208;Al&#8208;N is responsible for N  2  absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, allowing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;nitride to co&#8208;host chemical stability and catalytic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This perspective highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of 'permanent' reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#176; to 125.3&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>H+&#8208;H&#8208; Pairs in Partial Oxidized MAX Phases for Bifunctional Catalytic Conversion of Furfurals into Linear Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the less favorable C=O hydrogenation and weak concerted acid catalysis cause unsatisfactory catalytic performance in the upgrading biomass&#8208;derived furfurals (i.e., furfural, 5&#8208;methyl furfural, and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural) to ketones (i.e., cyclopentanone, 2,5&#8208;hexanedione, and 1&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;hexanedione). Herein, a series of  partial oxidized MAX phase  (i.e., Ti  3  AlC  2  , Ti  2  AlC, Ti  3  SiC  2  ) supported Pd catalysts were fabricated, which showed high catalytic activity, particularly the Pd/Ti  3  AlC  2  displayed high efficiency to the target ketones. Detailed studies of catalytic mechanism confirm that in situ hydrogen spillover generates Frustrated Lewis H  +  &#8208;H  &#8722;  pairs, which not only act as the hydrogenation sites for the selective C=O hydrogenation but also provide acid sites for the ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites largely promote the bifunctional catalytic reactions, substantially reducing the reported minimum reaction temperature of various furfurals by at least 30&#8211;60 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical assembly of a micro&#8208; and macroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic molecular framework with tailored single&#8208;crystal size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>:  Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (  MM&#8208;TPY  )  with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates.  The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growt  h. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8208;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH  3  )  5  Ru  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz)Ru  II  (NH  3  )  5  ]  4+  . The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {Ru  III&#8211;&#948;  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz  &#8226;&#8211;  )Ru  II+&#948;  } transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500 cm  &#8208;1  , revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element H  DA  = 3750 cm  &#8208;1  . DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8208;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.</dc:description>

The excited-state Creutz-Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli responsive silylene: Electromerism induced reversible switching between mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene  1  , [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ] (  L  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound  1  has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic Cu(I)X (X = Mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a  de novo  designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH 7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH 3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active  N&#8208;  trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented.

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for&#160;Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for  19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;thymidine (T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  ) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high  19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  make it a valuable  19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (  E  )&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the  E/Z  selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs  2  CO  3  ) to obtain more stable intermediates and evaluate the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is significant and challenging to use CO  2  to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO  2  &#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break &gt; 600% is able to be used as an elastomer. The communication proposes a method to provide polyester elastomer from CO  2  and olefins for the first time, and expands the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Germapyramidane Switches Between 3D Cluster and 2D Cyclic Structures in Single Electron Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;substituted diphosphete&#8208;diide, (IPr)2C2P2 (IDP), with GeCl2&#8729;dioxane and KBArF24 [(BArF24)&#8722; = tetrakis[(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate)] afforded the dicationic spherical&#8208;aromatic nido&#8208;cluster [Ge(&#951;4&#8208;IDP)]2+ ([1]2+) (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions which yield the radical cation [2] &#8226;+  and the neutral Ge(II) species 3. Both [2] &#8226;+  and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspective for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We wish that this minireview can provide inspirations in the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfenofunctionalization of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Synthesis of SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a new method for synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF  3  , SCF  2  R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF  3  functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF  3  allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site selectivity based on formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Isoxazole as a Native Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker for Photoaffinity Labeling and Chemoproteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique to interrogate drug&#8208;protein interactions in native cellular environments. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers are instrumental for this technique. However, the introduction of unnatural photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers may significantly reduce the bioactivity of the drug, thus impairing the chemoproteomic outcomes. Herein, we developed a common pharmacophore, isoxazole, into a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics, which minimally perturbs the drug structure. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking reactions of the isoxazole were thoroughly investigated for the first time. Functionalized isoxazoles were then designed and applied to protein labeling, demonstrating the superior photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking efficiency. Subsequently, two isoxazole&#8208;based drugs, Danazol and Luminespib, were employed in chemoproteomic studies, revealing their potential cellular targets. These results provide valuable strategies for future chemoproteomic study and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it incredibly easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the wild&#8208;type enzyme's low activity toward unnatural substrates like D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT) restricts its application. Herein, DAAO from  Rhodotorula gracilis  (  Rg  DAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinctive catalytic properties to hydrophilic substrates compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provided a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Boroaminomethylation of Olefins to &#947;&#8208;Boryl Amines with CO as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boroaminomethylation of olefins is an efficient process to convert hydrocarbons directly into boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Such chemicals are a good handle for obtaining more complexed amine derivatives through the various transformations of organoboron. However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8208;H bond. This method affords valuable  &#947;  &#8208;boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the  &#947;  &#8208;boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably,  13  C labeling studies revealed that the &#8208;CH  2  &#8208; building block was derived from one molecule of CO.</dc:description>

Ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide synthesis proceeded via a reaction mechanism that is completely different from that of conventional coupling reagents, and exhibited remarkable superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue concerned by peptide community. Herein, we presented a systematic mechanistic analysis, including kinetics study, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type structure&#8208;reactivity study, and density functional theory calculations, providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation. Based on these mechanistic studies, significant improvements were achieved, and the applicability scope of ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation has been successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Economic Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) polymers via green approaches is highly desirable but remains unexplored. We report the creation of an atom&#8208;economic enzymatic cascade catalysis, consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), that enables high&#8208;throughput reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) synthesis of UHMW polymers at volumes down to 50 &#956;L. FOx transforms formic acid, a C1 substrate, and oxygen to CO2 and H2O2, respectively. CO2 can escape from solution while H2O2 is in situ harnessed by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen&#8208;tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96&#8208;well plates to produce libraries of well&#8208;defined UHMW polymers, representing the first example of high&#8208;throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive adsorbents capture significant attention due to their tailorable performance upon light irradiation. The modulation of such adsorbents is mainly based on weak (physical) interactions caused by steric hindrance while tuning strong interaction with target adsorbates is scarce. Here we report smart &#960;&#8208;complexation adsorbents, which can adjust the &#960;&#8208;complexation of active sites via light irradiation. A typical metal&#8208;organic framework, MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH  2  , was decorated with azobenzene motifs, and Cu  +  as &#960;&#8208;complexation active sites were introduced subsequently. The reversible light&#8208;induced isomerization of azobenzene regulates the surface electrostatic potentials around Cu  +  from &#8211;0.038 to 0.008 eV, causing shielding and exposure effects. The alteration of CO uptake is achieved up to 54% via changing light, while that on MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH  2  is negligible. This study provides a clue for designing target&#8208;specific smart materials to meet the practical stimuli&#8208;responsive adsorption demands.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Reversible NIR&#8208;II Redox&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Probes for Imaging of Inflammation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent imaging shows great potential for deep tissue analysis at high resolution in living body owing to low background autofluorescence and photon scattering. However, reversible monitoring of redox homeostasis using NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate probes. In this study, a series of stable and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II dyes (  NIR&#8208;II  Cy3s  ) were constructed based on  trimethine skeleton.  Significantly, introducing the 1,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;decahydroquinoxaline group to the  NIR&#8208;II  Cy3s  not only effectively increased the wavelength, but also served as an effective response site for HClO, which can be restored by reactive sulfur species (RSS). Based on this,  NIR&#8208;II  Cy3s  were used for reversible monitoring of HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox processes in the pathophysiology environment. Finally,  NIR&#8208;II  Cy3&#8208;988  was successfully utilized for assessment of the redox environments and  drug treatment  effects in acute inflammation model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;Z metal&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (nMOFs) with photosensitizing ligands can enhance radiation damage to tumors via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RT&#8208;RDT) process. Here we report Monte Carlo (MC) simulation&#8208;guided design of a Th&#8208;based nMOF built from Th  6  &#8208;oxo secondary building units and 5,15&#8208;di(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (DBP) ligands, Th&#8208;DBP, for enhanced RT&#8208;RDT. MC simulations revealed that the Th&#8208;lattice outperformed the Hf&#8208;lattice in radiation dose enhancement owing to its higher mass attenuation coefficient. Upon X&#8208;ray or &#947;&#8208;ray radiation, Th&#8208;DBP enhanced energy deposition, generated more reactive oxygen species, and induced significantly higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells over the previously reported Hf&#8208;DBP nMOF. With low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, Th&#8208;DBP suppressed tumor growth by 88% in a colon cancer and 97% in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable and Red&#8208;Emissive Radical Cation for Mutp53 Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with conventional closed&#8208;shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non&#8208;emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive and water&#8208;stable pyrrole radical cation P  &#8226;+  &#8208;DPA&#8208;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8208;DPA&#8208;Zn by air oxidation. The deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive P  &#8226;+  &#8208;DPA&#8208;Zn can be used for imaging&#8208;guided mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of Zn  2+  into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53&#8208;manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanosheets (NSs) of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni have been produced by the post&#8208;modification of robust guanine&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;linked metal&#8208;free 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;containing HOF&#8208;25 followed by exfoliation.

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Platinum (II) Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small molecule that can activate cGAS&#8208;STING in a photocontrollable way is reported. Upon irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 can damage mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear envelope and nuclear DNA sequentially, which effectively releases DNA into cytoplasm to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two PtII complexes (Pt1 and Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>In Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle was achieved by dark&#8208;field microscopy and disclosed the transformation of amorphous SeNPs into polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2.







Abstract
Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.

         <title>Ultrasmall Copper Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO2 photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.







Abstract
Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8211;shell architecture is very challenging but of interest for CO2 reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into a series of benchmark Zr&#8208;MOFs, without Cu NCs aggregation, via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8211;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs, regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at the atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the CuI sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze CO2 photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8722;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in strategies for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation are summarized in this Review. Strategies developed to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic borylation, such as approaches controlled by electronic effects, auxiliaries, and steric factors, are also discussed. EDG=electron donating group, DG=directing group, TM=transition metal.







Abstract
Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8722;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed and nondirected strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8722;H functionalizations, C&#8722;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoboron compounds. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective strategies have been developed. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation procedures is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination by metal precursors in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation. We believe that this Review will help to increase interest in this field and stimulate further progress.

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula can be precisely determinated from mass spectroscopy. However, a complete structure characterization by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution. The results not only correlate well to their crystallographic structures, but also allow the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.

         <title>Understanding the Nature and Strength of Noncovalent Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new series of fullerene&#8208;based molecular torsion balances and examined their folding equilibrium to understand the nature and strength of noncovalent face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8722;fullerene interactions. The contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions were experimentally quantified by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.







Abstract
Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8722;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a tessellated triangle T1 and the construction of a tessellated octahedron O1 containing metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels are demonstrated. O1 has a diameter on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and a molecular weight greater than 84&#8197;kDa. After hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions. Whereas two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons are plentiful, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels and formed via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and molecular weights greater than 84&#8197;kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed from the tessellated triangles and octahedrons, respectively, through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. In addition, after hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.

         <title>2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biphenol&#8208;based Ultrathin Microporous Nanofilms for Highly Efficient Molecular Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging membrane separation technology, which urgently requires robust, easily processed, OSN membranes possessing high permeance and small solutes&#8208;selectivity to facilitate enhanced industrial uptake. Herein, we describe the use of two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives&#160;to fabricate hyper&#8208;crosslinked, microporous polymer nanofilms through IP. Ultra&#8208;thin, defect&#8208;free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (~5 nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino&#8208;BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut&#8208;off as low as 233 Da and MeOH permeance of ~13 LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W.&#160;based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization catalyzed by a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.







Abstract
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer&#8208;targeting glycosylated gold&#8208;based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) has a domain structure in which regions that are modified by epimerization and sulfonation (NS domains) are interspersed by unmodified fragments (NA domains). There is data to support that domain organization of HS can regulate binding of proteins, however, such model has been difficult to probe. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide HS oligosaccharides composed of two or more NS domains separated by NA domains of different length. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a HS oligosaccharide that enzymatically was extended by various GlcA&#8208;GlcNAc units and terminated in GlcNAc having an azido moiety at C&#8208;6 position. HS oligosaccharides having an azide and alkyne moiety could assembled by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to give compounds having various NS domains separated by unsulfonated regions. Competition binding studies showed that the length of an NA domain modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Asymmetric Cyclization  of Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Substituted 1,6&#8208;Enynes for the Synthesis of Seletracetam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing groups into organic molecules can significantly affect their physical and chemical properties and has long been used as an effective strategy for drug discovery and development. Consequently, the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles is highly desirable and sought after. Herein, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed defluorination&#8208;triggered asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes, providing an expedient access to synthetically attractive 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones&#160;in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (90&#8208;99% ee, &gt; 35 examples). This protocol features readily available starting materials and excellent&#160;functional group compatibility, and exhibits complementary regioselectivity. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Molecular Activation and Proton Feeding by Dual Active Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO  2  provides an appealing way to alleviate the energy crisis and manage the global carbon balance but is limited by the high activation energy and the rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer. We now develop a dual&#8208;site strategy for high&#8208;efficiency CO  2  conversion through polarizing CO  2  molecules at pyridine N vacancies and accelerating the intermediate protonation by protonated pyridine N adjacent to nitrogen vacancies on polymeric carbon nitride. Our photocatalysts with atomic&#8208;level engineered active sites manifest a high CO production rate of 1835 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8208;1  , 183 times higher than the pristine bulk carbon nitride. Theoretical prediction and experimental studies confirm that such excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between vacant and protonated pyridine N in decreasing the formation energy of the key *COOH intermediates and the efficient electron transfer relay facilitated by the defect&#8208;induced shallow trap state and homogeneous charge mediators.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster is a complex organometallic cofactor whose assembly and installation requires three dedicated accessory proteins referred to as HydE, HydF, and HydG. The roles of these maturases and the precise mechanisms by which they synthesize and insert the H&#8208;cluster are not fully understood. This mini&#8208;review will focus on new insights into the [FeFe]&#8208;maturation process that have been provided by&#160;  in vitro  &#160;approaches in which the biosynthetic pathway has been partially or fully reconstructed using semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;based approaches. Specifically, the application of these&#160;  in vitro  , semisynthetic, and fully defined approaches has shed light on the roles of individual maturation enzymes, the nature of H&#8208;cluster assembly intermediates, the molecular precursors of H&#8208;cluster ligands, and the sequence of steps involved in [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We leveraged the recent increase in synthetic accessibility of SF5Cl and Ar&#8208;SF4Cl compounds to combine chemistry of the SF5 and SF4Ar groups with strain&#8208;release functionalization.&#160; By effectively adding SF5 and SF4Ar radicals across [1.1.1]propellane, we accessed structurally unique bicyclopentanes, bearing two distinct elements of bioisosterism.&#160; Upon evaluating these &#8220;hybrid isostere&#8221; motifs in the solid state, we measured exceptionally short transannular distances; in one case, the distance rivals the shortest nonbonding C&#183;&#183;&#183;C contact reported to date.&#160; This prompted SC&#8208;XRD and DFT analyses that support the notion that a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction involving the &#8220;wing&#8221; C&#8211;C bonds is playing an important role in stabilization.&#160; Thus, these heretofore unknown structures expand the palette for highly coveted three&#8208;dimensional fluorinated building blocks and provide insight to a more general effect observed in bicyclopentanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Aluminosilicate Nanosheets as Universal Precursors for the Synthesis of Diverse Zeolite Nanosheets for Polymer&#8208;Cracking Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites catalyze some reactions in their molecular&#8208;sized pores, but large molecules can react only on their external surface. Zeolite&#8208;nanosheets (NSs) have been developed as catalysts for large molecules. The previously reported methods to synthesize zeolite&#8208;NSs are specialized for each crystal. Here we propose a new method to synthesize various zeolite&#8208;NSs from the same amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs) as a universal precursor. We successfully synthesized the unprecedented AAS&#8208;NSs in the hydrophilic space of the stable hyperswollen lyotropic lamellar (HL) phase. The four zeolite types could be obtained from the single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs. These results imply that this method enables us to synthesize almost all types of zeolite&#8208;NSs. Moreover, the synthesized CHA&#8208;NSs have great potential for various applications because of their thickness and large external surface area.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of&#160;ortho&#8208;carborane and lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that BoCb3&#160;is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for the Asymmetric Preparation of &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic Allyl Silanes, Germanes, and Boronate Esters via Dual Copper Hydride&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Stereogenic allyl metalloids are versatile synthetic intermediates which can undergo various stereocontrolled transformations. Most existing methods to prepare &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids involve multi&#8208;step sequences that curtail the number of compatible substrates and are limited to the synthesis of boronates. Here, we report a general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids utilizing dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208; catalysis. This approach leverages a stereospecific&#160;Cu&#8208;to&#8208;Pd transmetalation of an  in situ  generated alkyl copper species to allow access to enantioenriched allyl silanes, germanes, and boronate esters with broad functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [  cis  &#8208;terpyOsNCl  2  ]PF  6  inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Enzyme Substrate Scope Complementarity for Promiscuous Cascade Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic cascades are uniquely powerful for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. However, high substrate specificity can hinder the scope of biocatalytic cascades because the constituent enzymes may have non&#8208;complementary activity. Here, we implement a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase (ObiH) and a decarboxylase for the production of chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. To generate a promiscuous cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on &#946;&#8208;OH amino acids while avoiding activity on  l  &#8208;threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leverage this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scopes to produce a variety of enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This demonstration shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C&#8208;C bond forming cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Photoactivatable Tag Attached to Fluorophores Enables Their Use for Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells. We developed a general strategy for photoactivatable fluorophores, using 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiine group (SO) as a tag to attach to various skeletal structures, including coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, and cyanine. The conjugation of SO resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Under the irradiation of excitation light, singlet oxygen generated by the fluorophores converted the SO moiety into its ester derivative, terminated the PeT process, and restored the fluorescence. Single molecule localization imaging was achieved using a dual functional illuminating beam in the visible, acting as both the activating and the exciting source. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubule structures in neurons.Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells.

         <title>Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO  2  and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO  2  utilization. Currently, problems include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal&#8208;free access to recyclable PCPC by copolymerization of CO  2  and CPO using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0 kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near&#8208;quantitative yield (&gt;99%). The preparation and depolymerization of PCPC along with in depth understanding of related mechanisms would be helpful for further development of advanced catalysts and recyclable plastics.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unsaturated Bond Strategy to Regulate Active Centers of Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks&#160;for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated environment is the key to affect catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unveiling the effect of unsaturated sites toward ORR activity is of importance due to the vague unsaturated states. Reported here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy on the evaluation of unsaturated bonds (UBs) on adjacent carbon environment by precisely developing two metal&#8208;free vinyl&#8208;/azo&#8208;decorated covalent organic frameworks (  Vinyl&#8208;COF  and  Azo&#8208;COF  ) as catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared UB&#8208;COFs exhibit good performance than the control  Py&#8208;COF  and comparable to the most reported carbon catalysts. Supported by theory calculations and in situ Raman spectra&#8208;electrochemistry, it is revealed that the UBs in organic catalysts can produce  para  &#8208;activation, identifying the  para  C=N groups as active centers. Importantly, the intrinsic UBs can induce local charge redistribution, and make the molecular skeleton possess high isosurface map distribution, with an efficient affinity for oxygen intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolated, reduced Pd nanoclusters with resolved structures for the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although thiolated, reduced Group 11 metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity have been repeatedly reported in the past decade, their Pd analogs have not been reported thus far. In this work, we provide a resolution for the challenging synthesis and obtain for the first time an atomically monodisperse thiolated, reduced Pd (q=+0.75)nanocluster with a ditetrahedron Pd  8  kernel and a +3 charged interstitial B atom, as revealed by ESI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, etc. &#181;&#8208;6 B is found for the first time in Group 10 and 11 metal nanoclusters. More importantly, the as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to the newly synthesized ~1.4 nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd  2  complex and even a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), having significant implications for the influence of the metal charge state and space structure on the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with a small environmental footprint. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years, more complex oxides have emerged. This Review discusses different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials having a small environmental footprint and excellent performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate between the role of free versus that of bound charges within the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of the overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. wastewater treatment and ultimately water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamidation of (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with excellent reaction scope by using oxalamides or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides as the ligands. For bromides, only 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% CuI and oxalamides were required. For chlorides, increasing catalytic loadings to 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu2O and ligands was needed. Direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs were achieved under these conditions.







Abstract
Direct N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing pharmaceutically important N&#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulting from the previous condensation method. Most known catalytic methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu2O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible and fast vapor&#8208;triggered mechanical response of an actuating composite film based on crystalline organic cages.







Abstract
The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (Oba&#8208;cage) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Morphological Anisotropy in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Micro/Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework micro/nanoparticles (MOF MNPs) are reviewed with a focus on their morphological anisotropy, which plays a unique role in producing innovative structures and regulating properties with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order construction of MOF&#8208;based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bambusuril macrocycle is utilized for selective stripping of [Au(CN)2]&#8722; anion from activated carbon&#8212;a process relevant to industrial gold production. The efficient stripping is due to the complex of the macrocycle and [Au(CN)2]&#8722; formed at micromolar concentration in aqueous media.







Abstract
Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)2]&#8722;, plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8211;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)2]&#8722; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)2]&#8722; over [Ag(CN)2]&#8722;.

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* analogue [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; resisted all coordination attempts for more than 40&#8197;years. Now its first transition metal complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] is reported. The exceptionally weak binding character of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is proved by DFT calculations and substitution reactions with arenes, allowing to switch between ligand and weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
The reaction of AgBF4 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H)] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+ is &#8776;70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722; due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.

         <title>Diterpene Biosynthesis from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogues with Changed Reactivities Expands Skeletal Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogues of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bond were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases. The double bond shift causes a change of reactivity that results in the formation of many diterpenes with novel skeletons. A total number of 28 new diterpenes is reported and their mechanism of formation is discussed.







Abstract
Two analogues of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bonds, named iso&#8208;GGPP I and iso&#8208;GGPP II, were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases from bacteria, fungi and protists. The changed reactivity in the substrate analogues resulted in the formation of 28 new diterpenes, many of which exhibit novel skeletons.

         <title>Insight into the Overlooked Photochemical Decomposition of Atmospheric Surface Nitrates Triggered by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to the decomposition of surface nitrates. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be gradually decomposed to NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. The presence of water vapor promotes the generation of gas&#8208;phase products because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by the abundant surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides (NOx) formed by photochemical reaction of surface nitrates raise significant concerns. However, little is known about the effect of visible light (&gt;380&#8197;nm) on nitrate decomposition and the reaction mechanism. Herein, the decomposition of surface nitrates is investigated under visible light. The results indicate that visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to nitrate decomposition. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be decomposed into NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. Water vapor promotes NOx generation because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions. Alternatively, b&#8208;NO3&#8722; can be directly decomposed to NO2&#8722; by NO attack, but this process is subject to photocatalytic oxidation. This work brings a new focus on the atmospheric NOx sources and provides a more nuanced understanding of nitrates decomposition processes.

         <title>Mild and Chemoselective Carboxylic Acid Reduction Promoted by Borane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, chemoselective method for the reduction of carboxylic acids, in the presence of both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic functional groups is reported. Experiments and DFT calculations point to a mechanism driven by hidden borane catalysis.







Abstract
Although considerable advances have been made in developing chemoselective transformations of ubiquitous carboxylic acid groups, many challenges still exist. For instance, their selective reduction is problematic if both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic groups are present in the starting material. Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench&#8208;stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro&#8208;groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds via hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of in situ generated BH3 playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.

Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench-stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro-groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds via hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of in situ generated BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Growth Mechanism of a Conductive MOF Thin Film in Spray&#8208;based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limited and self&#8208;repairing growth mechanism was demonstrated for the preparation of LBL&#8208;LPE thin films. The method provides a high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientation at its bottom part.







Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy (LBL&#8208;LPE) method is widely used in preparing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) thin films with the merits of controlling thickness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for superior performances in applications. The LBL&#8208;LPE growth mechanism related to the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation is critical but very challenging to study. In this work, a novel &#8220;in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limiting and self&#8208;repairing&#8221; thin&#8208;film growth mechanism is demonstrated by the combination study of the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation of Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;xC thin film via microscopic analysis techniques and electrical measurements. This mechanism results a desired high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientations at its bottom for the first time and is very helpful for optimizing the LBL&#8208;LPE method, understanding the growth cycle&#8208;dependent properties of MOF thin film, and inspiring the investigations of the biomimetic self&#8208;repairing materials.

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos: Highly Advantageous Properties as Molecular Photoswitches
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole, pyrrole, or indole substitution of heterocyclic hemithioindigo chromophores can deliver advanced photoswitching properties: combining full visible light responsiveness, high overall absorptions, pronounced absorption changes, up to quantitative isomer interconversions in both directions, tunable thermal isomerization speeds, and very high quantum yields. Precise geometry changes can be controlled by balancing isomer&#8208;specific chalcogen and hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A survey of heterocyclic hemithioindigo photoswitches is presented identifying a number of structural motives with outstanding property profiles. The highly sought&#8208;after combination of pronounced color change, quantitative switching in both directions, exceptional high quantum yields, and tunable high thermal stability of metastable states can be realized with 4&#8208;imidazole, 2&#8208;pyrrole, and 3&#8208;indole&#8208;based derivatives. In the former, an unusual preorganization using isomer selective chalcogen&#8208; and hydrogen bonding allows to precisely control geometry changes and tautomerism upon switching. Heterocyclic hemithioindigos thus represent highly promising photoswitches with advanced capabilities that will be of great value to anyone interested in establishing defined and reversible control at the molecular level.

         <title>Salt&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Reinforced Carbonate Electrolyte for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt strategy is proposed to boost LiNO3 solubility in carbonate electrolytes using multivalent salt carrier. The NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing anion complexes and multivalent cations as interphase adsorbing components promote the anion&#8208;derived SEI formation. The designed electrolyte presents a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;% and enables the NMC811 full cells with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The instability of carbonate electrolyte with metallic Li greatly limits its application in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Here, a &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; strategy is applied to boost the LiNO3 solubility in the carbonate electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 carrier, which enables the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for excellent Li metal anode performance and also maintains the cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, both NO3&#8722; and PF6&#8722; anions participate in the Li+&#8208;solvent complexes, thus promoting the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Our designed electrolyte has achieved a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;%, enabling the high&#8208;loading NCM811||Li (4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) full cell with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles. The enhancement of LiNO3 solubility by divalent salts is universal, which will also inspire the electrolyte design for other metal batteries.

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of non&#8208;centrosymmetric hybrid Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites are reported, showing second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. The largest SHG signal from CH3NH3GeBr3 is likely due to the perferable alignment of the polar cation with the lone pair electrons of Ge2+ along the [111] direction.







Abstract
Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for second harmonic generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid 3D Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites AGeBr3, A=CH3NH3 (MA), CH(NH2)2 (FA), Cs and FAGe0.5Sn0.5Br3, crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr3 shows the strongest SHG intensity (5&#215;potassium dihydrogen phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge2+ along [111] direction and the relatively strong interactions between lone pair electrons of Ge2+ and polar MA cations along the c&#8208;axis. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.

Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; along [111] direction and the relatively strong interactions between lone pair electrons of Ge&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and polar MA cations along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine-tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell ZnO@Microporous Organic Polymer Nanospheres as Enhanced Piezo&#8208;Triboelectric Energy Harvesting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;shell nanospheres were prepared by the homogeneous coating of piezoelectric ZnO nanorod aggregates with triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP). The small energy harvesting performance of ZnO@MOP was significantly enhanced, compared with those of ZnO and MOP, due to the piezoelectrificationinduced polarization of inner ZnO and the enhanced generation of tribopositive charges of MOP. Piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerators (PTENGs) fabricated with ZnO@MOP showed peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 529 V and maximum power density of 1.19 mW/cm  2  . In addition, the PTENGs showed excellent durability for 30000 cycles, demonstrating as efficient power sources for charging electrolytic capacitors and for operating 200 green light emitting diode bulbs.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceeding 30% External Quantum Efficiency in Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Utilizing Solution Processable TADF Emitters with High Horizontal Dipole Orientation via Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies to enhance the ratio of the molecular horizontal emitting dipole orientation (&#920;//) for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have unlocked the full potential of efficiencies for the evaporated devices, which, however, remain elusive for the solution&#8208;processed ones. Here, a strategic molecular design for solution processable TADF emitters featuring high &#920;//s is proposed by attaching flexible chains ended with bipolar 9,9'&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core. It&#8217;s unveiled that the anchoring groups not only enhance the horizontal orientation via enlarging molecular planarity, but also benefit the high photoluminescence in pristine films. The corresponding non&#8208;doped solution processable OLEDs substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) &gt; 30%. Meanwhile, combining these compounds as TADF sensitizers, and multiple resonance final emitter, solution&#8208;processed OLEDs achieve an EQEmax of 25.6% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 29 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>The Story of the Little Blue Box: A Tribute to Siegfried H&#252;nig</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene), also known as the little blue box, constitutes a modular receptor that has facilitated the discovery of many host&#8208;gust complexes and mechanically interlocked molecules during the past 35 years. Its versatility in binding small &#960;&#8208;donors in its tetracationic state, as well as forming trisradical tricationic complexes with viologen radical cations in its doubly reduced bisradical dicationic state, renders it valuable for the construction of various stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Since the first reports in 1988, the little blue box has been featured in over 500 publications in the literature. All this research activity would not have been possible without the seminal contributions carried out by Siegfried H&#252;nig, who, not only pioneered the syntheses of viologen&#8208;containing cyclophanes, but also revealed their rich redox chemistry in addition to their ability to undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8208;dimerization. This review describes how his pioneering research led to the design and synthesis of the little blue box, and how this redox&#8208;active host evolved into the key component of molecular shuttles, switches and machines.</dc:description>

         <title>What X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Can Tell Us About the Active State of Earth&#8208;Abundant Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC&#8208;XAS experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triplet Label Extends Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy from Pico&#8208; to Microseconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, the inherently short vibrational lifetimes limit the time window to observe molecular dynamics typically to tens of picoseconds. The rather complex dynamics of organized molecular systems (  e.g.,  glass formers, polymers, membranes, proteins), however, span a wide range of timescales from femto&#8208; to microseconds and beyond. Vibrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance (VIPER) 2D&#8208;IR negates the limitations of 2D&#8208;IR spectroscopy, for its signal decays with the electronic lifetime. Here, we present 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone as the first VIPER 2D&#8208;IR probe to exploit intersystem crossing, thereby covering even the microsecond timescale. We achieved the required signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and resolution by introducing the Fourier&#8208;transform approach to the VIPER 2D&#8208;IR pulse sequence. Now, we are in a position to monitor dynamics via spectral diffusion several orders of magnitude beyond the vibrational lifetime of 2D&#8208;IR labels.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8220;Unclear&#8221; Infection Imaging?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides summary and critical evaluation, including the challenges and pitfalls, of antibiotic&#8208;derived positron emission tomographic radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging either considered for radiotracer development for infection imaging or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization.







Abstract
The excellent features of non&#8208;invasive molecular imaging, its progressive technology (real&#8208;time, whole&#8208;body imaging and quantification), and global impact by a growing infrastructure for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are encouraging prospects to investigate new concepts, which could transform clinical care of complex infectious diseases. Researchers are aiming towards the extension beyond the routinely available radiopharmaceuticals and are looking for more effective tools that interact directly with causative pathogens. We reviewed and critically evaluated (challenges or pitfalls) antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging. We considered both radiotracer development for infection imaging and radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization; overall, a total of 20 original PET radiotracers derived from eleven approved antibiotics.

         <title>One and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Reduced AIEgen&#8208;Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;reduced TPE&#8208;cored ligand was applied for the construction of MOFs with dense packing structures, which are beneficial to the improvement of one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent properties, achieving high TPA cross&#8208;sections of &#8776;3000&#8197;GM.







Abstract
By designing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based AIEgen&#8208;ligand with reduced symmetry, we obtained two alkaline&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based MOFs (LIFM&#8208;102 and LIFM&#8208;103) with dense packing structures and low porosity as proved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and CO2 sorption data. Excitingly, the desolvated MOFs with rigid environment and reduced lattice free solvent exhibit high quantum yields (QY, 64.9&#8201;% and 79.4&#8201;%) and excellent two&#8208;photon excited photoluminescence (TPA cross&#8208;sections, 2946.6&#8197;GM and 2899.0&#8197;GM), while maintaining the external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties suitable for anticounterfeit fields. The effect of ligand conformation was validated by comparing the structure and fluorescence properties of the samples before and after desolvation and further verified by theoretical calculations. This work expands the study on TPE&#8208;cored materials to symmetry&#8208;reduced ligand and might bring forward novel structures and excellent photoluminescent properties in the future.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Human Cell Membranes Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was able to resolve the distribution of molecules in human pancreatic cancer cell membranes. TERS imaging revealed the arrangement of different cell membrane components with a spatial resolution down to 2.5&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Lack of appropriate tools for visualizing cell membrane molecules at the nanoscale in a non&#8208;invasive and label&#8208;free fashion limits our understanding of many vital cellular processes. Here, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the molecular distribution in pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC&#8208;3) membranes in ambient conditions without labelling, with a spatial resolution down to ca. 2.5&#8197;nm. TERS imaging reveals segregation of phenylalanine&#8208;, histidine&#8208;, phosphatidylcholine&#8208;, protein&#8208;, and cholesterol&#8208;rich BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane domains at the nm length&#8208;scale. TERS imaging also showed a cell membrane region where cholesterol is mixed with protein. Interestingly, the higher resolution TERS imaging revealed that the molecular domains observed on the BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane are not chemically &#8220;pure&#8221; but also contain other biomolecules. These results demonstrate the potential of TERS for non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free imaging of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Integrating Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Two&#8208;Dimensional Elastic&#8208;Bending and Reconfigurable Plastic&#8208;Twisting Deformations into an Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations were successfully implemented and could be controlled independently in an organic crystal. The multiple flexibilities enabled both spatial control of the optical transmission for cryogenic applications and the reusability of light polarization rotations.







Abstract
Integrating plasticity and elasticity in anisotropic molecular crystals is theoretically possible and is beneficial in enabling rich and complex deformations; however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Herein, we report a centimeter&#8208;long organic crystal that is two&#8208;dimensionally (2D) elastically bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C). The straight crystal can also be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helical structures. The integration of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant (LTR) 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility. Taking advantage of the unique multiple flexibility characteristics, spatial controllability of optical transmission for cryogenic applications and reusability of light&#8208;polarization rotations have been implemented simultaneously in an organic crystal.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Regulated Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Scalable Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
A hole transport material (BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F) is designed, and it can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility, a decreased energy disorder and high scalability. The perovskite solar cells based on BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F without any dopant obtain promising power conversion efficiencies of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%) for small&#8208;area devices (0.062&#8197;cm2) and 20.17&#8201;% for large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport materials (HTMs) remain highly desirable for stable and efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) but rarely succeed. Here, we propose a molecular assembly strategy to overcome the limited optoelectronic properties of organic HTMs by precisely designing a linear organic small molecule BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F from the atomic to the molecular levels. BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility and decreased energy disorder. The resultant pero&#8208;SCs showed a promising efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%), which is the highest certified value of pero&#8208;SCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs, to date. These devices also showed a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 22.50&#8201;% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 20.17&#8201;% for 15.64&#8208;cm2 module. For the first time, the pero&#8208;SCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs realized ultralong stabilities with T80 lifetimes over 1200&#8197;h under operation or thermal aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Characterization of a Proposed Terminal Iron(III) Nitride Intermediate of Nitrogen Fixation Stabilized by a Trisphosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation and low&#8208;temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl) borane), a plausible intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, is reported. EPR spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations define a 2A ground state electronic structure for this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride, placing an unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector.







Abstract
Terminal iron nitrides (Fe&#8801;N) have been proposed as intermediates of Fe&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, and well&#8208;defined synthetic iron nitrides have been characterized in high oxidation states, including FeIV, FeV, and FeVI. This study reports the generation and low temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), which is a proposed intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation by the P3BFe&#8208;catalyst system. CW&#8208; and pulse EPR spectroscopy (HYSCORE and ENDOR), supported by DFT calculations, help to define a 2A ground state electronic structure of this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride species, placing the unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector; this electronic structure is distinct for an iron nitride. The unusual d5&#8208;configuration is stabilized by significant delocalization (&#8776;50&#8201;%) of the unpaired electron onto the axial boron and nitrogen ligands, with a majority of the spin residing on boron.

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyisoprenes with an appropriate mixture of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures were synthesized by scandium catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of isoprene. The polyisoprenes exhibited excellent elasticity and self&#8208;healability without any external intervention, which is a result of microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a highly flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix at the nanoscale.







Abstract
The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.

         <title>Sorbents for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: From Design Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) holds great promise in offering decentralized solutions for broad access to safe drinking water. This Review systematically discusses the moisture extraction mechanisms and related design rules of various sorbent materials. Device engineering and multifunctional applications are also discussed to present a comprehensive picture of sorbent&#8208;based AWH.







Abstract
Water scarcity caused by climate change and population growth poses a grave threat to human society. Of the different water purification technologies put forward, one presents a promising strategy that is spatially or temporally non&#8208;restricted&#8212;atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Here we review recent progress in the design and study of AWH sorbents, ranging from the innovative chemistries to the integration of sophisticated architectures and functional components, and clarify the structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship that governs the water capture and release processes. Features and limitations of each type of sorbents are summarized to elucidate the optimal working environments and modes. Progress in applications extending from water generation to thermal management and agriculture are discussed. Future developments regarding material modifications, performance measurements, and system optimizations are provided to overcome lingering barriers to sorbent design and implementation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>

         <dc:description>
In neutral aqueous solution, a single&#8208;atom nanozyme Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic active sites exhibited ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and durability of 100&#8197;h for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO2, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97&#8201;% over &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE reached a maximum of 1.23&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (turnover frequency of 69.7&#8197;s&#8722;1) with an FE of 99.6&#8201;%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has an increase and a decrease in the 
 and dxz/yz orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site is more superior to activate CO2 molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.

The biosynthesis of the oxetane nucleoside albucidin was demonstrated in vitro to proceed in two steps involving the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction reaction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which is responsible for the elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. These activities are uncommon among the presently described radical SAM enzymes.







Abstract
Oxetanocin&#8197;A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin&#8197;A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in Streptomyces. Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes alsA and alsB are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study (Myronovskyi et&#8197;al. Microorganisms 2020, 8, 237). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed in vitro by the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;pro&#8208;R hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Splitting of Mono&#8208; and Dibranched Hexane Isomers by a Robust Zinc&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high surface area and optimal pore aperture has been used for the discrimination of alkane isomers. It adsorbs linear and monobranched alkanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, with high capacities and selectivities, outperforming other splitters for alkane isomers.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency separation of C6 alkanes, particularly the mono&#8208; and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size&#8208;exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn&#8208;tcpt (H3tcpt=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine), with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of hms nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono&#8208; and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C6 alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt, and the size&#8208;exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by ab initio materials modeling. The high&#8208;efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Based Supramolecular Access to Full&#8208;Scale Phase&#8208;Diagram Structures through in situ Phase&#8208;Volume Ratio Phototuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy was demonstrated based on the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules (persulfurated arenes) and block polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions, leading to a progressive and wide&#8208;ranging phase transitions across the phase diagram under different irradiation periods.







Abstract
Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.

Highly efficient asymmetric intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrones were combined with C3&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a tandem fashion. The resulting diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure cycloadducts were successfully converted into (+)&#8208;lycopladine A and lycoposerramine R.







Abstract
2&#8208;Pyrones with a chiral branched allylic silyl ether substituent underwent intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with remarkably high &#960;&#8208;facial&#8208; and endo&#8208;selectivities.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but different functional groups ranging from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing on the pore channel were pre&#8208;designed as TENGs platform and further used to protect the cathodic current of carbon steel. Besides, the corresponding output performance of the COF&#8208;TENG to be precisely tuned through the transmit effects of surface sites to the polygonal backbones.







Abstract
Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420&#8197;V and 64&#8197;&#956;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.

         <title>An Inorganic Huisgen Reaction between a 1,2&#8208;Diboraallene and an Azide to Access a Diboratriazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the regioselective cycloaddition of 1,2&#8208;diboraallene with aryl azide, namely, Huisgen 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, affords an aromatic diboratriazole derivative. The diboratriazole readily releases N2 without the aid of any catalysts to furnish a 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative.







Abstract
Regioselective Huisgen cycloaddition reaction between 1,2&#8208;diboraallene and azide proceeds under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions to furnish a diboratriazole (2). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N3 five&#8208;membered ring of (2), indicating its aromatic features. Molecule (2) spontaneously releases N2 to form the 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative (3). The mechanism of a whole reaction profile was extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Chloride Ion Adsorption Enables Ampere&#8208;Level CO2 Electroreduction over Silver Hollow Fiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordination adsorbed Cl&#8722; on the surface of silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) not only suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction but also optimizes the kinetics of CO2 reduction to CO at ampere&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable feedstocks is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. However, it remains a challenge to possess a large current density, a high faradaic efficiency and excellent stability for practical applications of CO2 utilization. Herein, we report a facile tactic that enables exceedingly efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of low&#8208;coordination chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption on a silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) electrode. A CO faradaic efficiency of 92.3&#8201;% at a current density of one ampere per square centimeter (1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 3.0&#8197;M KCl with a sustained performance observed during a 150&#8208;hour test was achieved, which is better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a low&#8208;coordination Cl&#8722; adsorption on surface of Ag HF, which not only suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also facilitated the CO2 reduction kinetics.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries via a Semi&#8208;Conductive Bipolar&#8208;Type Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) with a moderate electronic conductivity of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated as the cathode material for aqueous Zn battery. With the synergetic benefits of the semi&#8208;conductive nature and bipolar&#8208;type reaction of PDAN, the Zn//PDAN cell shows a promising capacity and a perfect cycle stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (&#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (&#8776;2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation can get electrochemical performance improved by introducing functional groups. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PANI&#8208;H+/CNT organic composite cathode via fluoridized treatment provides a capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for PF6&#8722; storage, which may facilitate sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries with long cycle life and stable energy/power outputs.







Abstract
The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8722; storage. F&#8722; in PF6&#8722; is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8722;NH&#8722; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8722; can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/7720&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical Conjugation of Aptamers on a Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Enables Highly Stable and Selective In&#8197;Vivo Neurosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple approach to interface aptamers with implantable electrodes for in&#8197;vivo sensing is reported. The strategy employs direct electrochemical conjugation to couple aptamers onto carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes (CFEs) with high controllability, efficiency, and stability. The covalent linkage improves the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, thereby allowing the continuous in&#8197;vivo probing of dopamine (DA) dynamics in the brain.







Abstract
Interfacing aptamers with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) provides a versatile platform to probe the chemical activity in a living brain at the molecular level. However, new approaches are needed for the efficient and stable modification of electrode surfaces with aptamers. Here, we present an electrochemical conjugation strategy to covalently couple aptamers onto CFEs with high chemoselectivity, efficiency, and stability for sensing in the brain. The strategy employs an initial electrochemical coupling of catechol on an CFE, thereby generating a thin layer of quinone intermediates that couple rapidly with thiol&#8208;containing oligonucleotides under a controlled potential. This approach dramatically simplifies and improves the efficiency for modifying carbon surfaces, thereby allowing direct conjugation of high levels of aptamers on CFEs within 5&#8197;minutes. Importantly, the covalent linkage between the aptamers and carbon surfaces enables a greatly improved sensitivity and stability for the sensing of dopamine, offering a robust system for continuously probing dopamine dynamics in the living brains of animals.

Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diversified bioactive compounds, but asymmetric synthesis of chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction of N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodo&#8208;aryl)&#8208;propiolamides with nitrones has been developed, affording chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones as single diastereomers with high yields and good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diverse bioactive compounds. Current efforts to synthesize spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are limited to chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines]. Asymmetric synthesis of structurally similar chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/aryl C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction is described. This provides a straightforward access to densely functionalized chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones in good yields and with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn&#8208;S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent&#8208;Catalyst Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible Zn&#8722;S chemistry in aqueous media is realized by introducing tetraglyme cosolvent and iodine catalyst. The cosolvent&#8208;catalyst synergy can not only activate the polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple for S conversion but also generate an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase on Zn in situ, thus resulting in boosted cathode activity and anode stability. The strategy presents a new paradigm to stabilize aqueous Zn&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery with high energy density represents a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co&#8208;solvents and I2 as additive. The G4&#8208;I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn&#8722;S cell delivers a high capacity of 775&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and retains over 70&#8201;% capacity after 600 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte design strategy.

[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species. This compound is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 to generate an ion&#8208;separated species featuring a significantly short Al&#8722;C bond with Al=C &#960; bonding character.

Abstract
[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion (3) and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species (4). Compound (4) is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 gas under the mild reaction condition to generate an ion&#8208;separated species 5. An X&#8208;ray study shows that the anionic part of 5 bears a considerable short exocyclic Al&#8722;C bond, and computational studies involving molecular orbital and natural bond orbital analysis indicate the Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety of 5 undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation. Moreover, reaction of 5 with a diazo compound leads to the reduction and complete cleavage of the N=N double bond.

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction strategy is taken to synthesize diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu catalysts on 2D phosphorene. On the strength of the unique synergistic effect of PdCuP4 coordination, the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the transfer of intermediates, and the formation of N&#8801;N bond are all enhanced, leading to the high NO3&#8722; removal rate and N2 selectivity.







Abstract
The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP4 coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3&#8201;% NO3&#8722; removal rate and 95.2&#8201;% N2 selectivity. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO2&#8722;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N2.

The synergistic effect of PdCu dual-atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy was proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY). In this way, Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY are periodically interrupted to reformat and strengthen the delocalized electronic states, ultimately yielding excellent electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing decoration.







Abstract
&#960; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8722;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Halogen Atom Participation in Guiding the Stereochemical Outcomes of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic additions to &#945;&#8208;haloacetals proceed via an oxocarbenium ion intermediate where the carbon&#8208;halogen bond can either adopt a pseudo&#8208;axial or a pseudo&#8208;equatorial position. trans&#8208;Selectivity is typically observed when a halogen atom is positioned at C&#8208;2 of an acetal because hyperconjugative interactions involving the pseudo&#8208;axial carbon&#8208;halogen bond stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.







Abstract
Acetal substitution reactions of &#945;&#8208;halogenated five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings can be highly stereoselective. Erosion of stereoselectivity occurs as nucleophilicity increases, which is consistent with additions to a halogen&#8208;stabilized oxocarbenium ion, not a three&#8208;membered&#8208;ring halonium ion. Computational investigations confirmed that the open&#8208;form oxocarbenium ions are the reactive intermediates involved. Kinetic studies suggest that hyperconjugative effects and through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions can both contribute to the stabilization of halogen&#8208;substituted oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. The most stable isomer of Be4B12+ cluster is a closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms.







Abstract
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. When beryllium is gradually added to the B12 motif, it undergoes drastic structural modifications. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is an Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium forms strong bonding with the boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interactions. For instance, the bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ fragment in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12, followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) was proposed. The ACAC treatment can enlarge the grain size, and the EDA treatment stabilizes the perovskite against oxidation. A 13.0&#8201;% efficiency with improved stability was reported, which is one of the top efficiencies and stabilities for tin halide perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by the fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13&#8201;% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or amines are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a phthalocyanine, through simple solid&#8208;state static aging, is reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209033) by Sandra Kaabel, Eduardo Anaya&#8208;Plaza et al. This greener approach diminishes up to 100&#8208;fold the solvent usage of the traditional solution synthesis. Several metal derivatives (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), as well as electron&#8208;deficient derivatives were synthesized. The image shows the crude zinc tetra(tBu)phthalocyanine as obtained.

         <title>Reactive Solubilization of Heterometallic Clusters by Treatment of (TrBi3)2&#8722; Anions (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) with [Mn{N(SiMe3)2}2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The otherwise insoluble binary Zintl anions (TrBi3)2&#8722; (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) can be solubilized in THF on treatment with the low&#8208;coordinate manganese complex [Mn(hmds)2] (hmds=N(SiMe3)2), yielding new heterometallic Zintl clusters [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722;, [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (see figure), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722;. The electronic properties of the Bi22&#8722; anion&#8208;containing coordination compounds are disclosed.







Abstract
Lowering the charge of Zintl anions by (element&#8208;)organic substituents allows their use as sources of (semi)metal nanostructures in common organic solvents, as realized for group 15 anions or Ge94&#8722; and Sn94&#8722;. We developed a new strategy for other anions, using low&#8208;coordinate 3d metal complexes as electrophiles. [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of (TrBi3)2&#8722; anions dissolved in situ in Et2O and/or THF when reacted with [Mn(hmds)2]. Work&#8208;up afforded soluble [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722; (in 1), [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (in 2), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722; (in 3) (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; Tr=Ga, In, Tl; hmds=N(SiMe3)2), representing rare cases of Zintl clusters with open&#8208;shell metal atoms. 1 comprises the first coordination compound of the (TlBi3)2&#8722; anion, 2 features a diamond&#8208;shaped {Pn2M2} unit, and 3 is a mixed&#8208;valent MnI/MnII compound. The uncommon electronic structures in 1&#8211;3 and magnetic coupling were studied by comprehensive DFT calculations.
