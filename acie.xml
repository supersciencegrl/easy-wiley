         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8211;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272; = 1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.</dc:description>

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2a and 2b, "framed" and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium 2a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8208;Rh(I) complex 2aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8208;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4a) or C&#8208;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2b C&#8208;H was found to reversibly activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Ion Channels: From Natural to Artificial Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Mobility Differential Amplifier: Enhancing Pressure&#8208;Induced Voltage Response in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressured&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0 &#8211; 1 kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa with a fast response time of 18.1 ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate a human somatosensory network analogous PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin using arrayed pressure sensing. These capabilities hold great promise for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in&#8208;situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells Using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER&#8208;luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells.

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect   VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants.

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000 covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100 endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of novel targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Inorganic&#8208;Organic Dual&#8208;Photosensitizing Dinuclear&#8208;Metal Self&#8208;Assembly System for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis without Sacrificial Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct a novel inorganic&#8208;organic dual&#8208;photosensitizing dinuclear metal molecular catalyst, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. In photocatalytic reactions, this self&#8208;assembly hybrid not only optimized the charge transfer between inorganic PS and molecular catalysts, but also boosted the development of artificial photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.







Abstract
Owing to the unique synergistic effect, dinuclear&#8208;metal&#8208;molecule&#8208;catalysts (DMCs) show excellent performance in catalytic fields. However, for overall photocatalytic CO2 reaction (CO2RR), it is still a challenge to construct well&#8208;matched photosensitizer (PS) components for DMCs&#8208;based photocatalysts. Inorganic&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot PS possesses capacities of multiple exciton generation and catalyzing water oxidation but is incompatible with DMCs. In contrast, organic PS can be covalently linked with DMCs but inescapable of using sacrificial electron donors. For overall photocatalytic CO2RR, organic&#8211;inorganic dual&#8208;photosensitizing system might be a promising candidate. Herein, we employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;sensitized Co2L DMCs (Py&#8208;Co2L) and perovskite (PVK) quantum dots, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. Using H2O as an electron donor, PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L] realized 105.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 CO yield in photocatalytic CO2RR, much higher than PVK (15.44&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) and PVK@Co2L (32.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), ascribing to the efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer. The experimental results and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the pyrene linked on Co2L boosted the electron delivery from PVK to DMCs. Besides, this strategy could also be extended to the photocatalytic H2 evolution coupled with alcohol oxidation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work lightens the integration of DMCs, organic and inorganic PS components, promoting the development of photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a Unique Bacterial Alkaloid Assembled by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase and non&#8208;Enzymatic Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pyrrolizwilline produced by XhpA&#8208;G was elucidated in Xenorhabdus hominickii using a promoter exchange approach together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli. We also report the structural characterization of XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline.







Abstract
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from Xenorhabdus hominickii, xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of X. hominickii promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).

         <title>Constructing Ag/Cu2O Interface for Efficient Neutral CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of Ag/Cu2O interface significantly enhanced the C2H4 partial current density from 250.9 (Cu2O) to 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the neutral electrocatalytic CO2RR, showing a great breakthrough in activity and selectivity toward single products. Analytical results reveal partially preserved Cu+ species and increased CO coverage at interface synergistically promote C&#8722;C coupling, which enhances the understanding of bimetallic interface functions.







Abstract
Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag&#8208;Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6&#8201;% at 650&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0&#8201;% with a partial current density of 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8722;C coupling at the Ag/Cu2O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 performance and provided an in&#8208;depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.

         <title>A Discrete Four&#8208;Stranded &#946;&#8208;Sheet through Catenation of M2L2 Metal&#8211;Peptide Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discrete four&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet was precisely constructed by metal&#8208;induced folding and assembly of a short peptide. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) pentapeptide, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. The structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and various NMR measurements.







Abstract
Methods for precisely constructing a &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly with number&#8208;defined strands in solution remains quite limited due to its intense aggregation property. Here, we report the precise construction of a four&#8208;stranded anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet by utilizing a non&#8208;covalent approach. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and a pentapeptide (1) with the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) sequence, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. NMR analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies characterized the structure of the discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly as well as the remarkable structural selectivity in terms of strands&#8217; number, orientation and the sheet type.

         <title>A Poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Edges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New connecting positions of anthracene have been developed to construct an unprecedented poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges via the AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling followed by the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Its reactivity towards the full cyclodehydrogenation was investigated by solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted conditions. The peri&#8208;fusion endows a narrow band gap and near&#8208;infrared absorption with the title polymer.







Abstract
Anthracene has served as an important building block of conjugated polymers with the connecting positions playing a crucial role for the electronic structures. Herein, anthracene units have been coupled through their 2,7&#8208;carbons to develop an unprecedented, conjugated polymer, namely, poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) featuring additional peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges. The synthesis starts from a 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;nickel(II) porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene as the pivotal precursor. Polymerization is achieved by an AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling, followed by a polymer&#8208;analogous oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to obtain a peri&#8208;fusion between porphyrin and anthracene moieties. Although further cyclodehydrogenation between the repeating units cannot be achieved in solution, the thermal treatment of the precursor polymer derived from 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene on a metal surface realizes the full cyclodehydrogenation. The difference between solution and on&#8208;surface reactivity can be rationalized by the larger dihedral angle between repeat units in solution, which is reduced under the pronounced interaction with the metal surface. The peri&#8208;fusion in the title polymer gives rise to a narrow electronic band gap optical absorptions extending far into the near&#8208;infrared region. Oligomeric models are synthesized as well to support the analyses of the electronic and photophysical properties.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Magnetocapacitance Spanning 97K Hysteresis in Molecular Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) possess superior magnetocapacitance and a record thermal hysteresis width of 97&#8197;K. The magnetocapacitance comes from their intrinsic nature, rather than the composite results found in inorganic materials. Meanwhile, this is still the first time so far to study magnetocapacitance in molecule&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Magnetic capacitor, as a new type of device, has broad application prospects in fields such as magnetic field sensing, magnetic storage, magnetic field control, power electronics and so on. Traditional magnetic capacitors are mostly assembled by magnetic and capacitive materials. Magnetic capacitor made of a single material with intrinsic properties is very rare. This intrinsic property is magnetocapacitance (MC). The studies on MC effect have mainly focused on metal oxides so far. No study was reported in molecular materials. Herein, two complexes: (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) are reported. There exist strong H&#8722;Br and Br&#8722;Br interactions and other weak interactions in complex 2, so the phase transition energy barrier is high, resulting in the widest thermal hysteresis loop on a molecular level to date. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 2 show large MC parameters of 0.247 and 1.614, respectively, which is the first time to observe MC effect in molecular material.

Cupric&#8208;(di)amine complexes, such as those made using n&#8208;butylamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine or its enantiomer, constitute versatile and complementary reagents for promoting the diverse regio&#8208; and atroposelective intramolecular dehydrogenative couplings of galloyl groups in chemical syntheses of glucopyranosic ellagitannins, such as tellimagrandin I and pedunculagin, and C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins, according to routes mimicking their postulated biosynthesis.

Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.

         <title>Regulation of Exciton Effects in Functionalized Conjugated Polymers by B&#8208;N Lewis Pairs for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a B&#8722;N Lewis pair and adjusting Lewis acid basicity could minimize the exciton binding energy and prolong the lifetime of the exciton, thus significantly improving the charge separation and transfer efficiency. PyPBM exhibits an exponentially enhanced activity towards photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production with visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Strong excitonic effects are common in organic conjugated polymer semiconductors, severely hindering the generation of free charge carriers for conducting photocatalysis. Therefore, exploring new channels to modulate exciton dissociation in polymers is far&#8208;reaching in facilitating photocatalysis. A series of B&#8722;N Lewis pair functionalized conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize exciton effects by modulating charge transfer pathways. Theoretical studies have shown that introducing B&#8722;N Lewis pairs can dramatically increase the distance of charge transfer (D index) and the amount of electron transfer and reduce the Coulomb attraction energy (EC), which contributes to breaking the equilibrium of the coexistence of excitons and charge carriers. Further experimental results show that the singlet excitons are efficiently dissociated into more free&#8208;charge carriers under photoexcitation to participate in surface reactions. The optimized polymer PyPBM shows an exponential increase in photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production performance by visible light illumination.

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A band structure regulation strategy is proposed to design a HER&#8208;suppressed MnP alloy anode for aqueous Mn metal batteries, where the severe HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the high HOMO energy level and low electron escape work function of metallic Mn. Therefore, the MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 could deliver an extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation (88.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8722;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Separation of Integratively Self&#8208;Sorted Pd2LA2LB2 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two shape&#8208;complementary ligands coordinate with Pd(II) to form either heteroleptic or homoleptic cage species. The equilibrium of the products can be controlled by choosing DMSO or MeCN as a solvent. Joint experimental and theoretical analyses elucidate the driving force behind this separation.







Abstract
The integrative implementation of multiple different components into metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assemblies requires sophisticated strategies to avoid the formation of statistical mixtures. Previously, the key focus was set on thermodynamically driven reactions of simple homoleptic into complex heteroleptic structures. Using Pd2LA2LB2&#8208;type coordination cages, we herein show that integrative self&#8208;sorting can be reversed by a change of solvent (from DMSO to MeCN) to favor narcissistic re&#8208;segregation into coexisting homoleptic species Pd2LA4 and Pd3LB6. Full separation (&#8220;unsorting&#8221;) back to a mixture of the homoleptic precursors was finally achieved by selective precipitation of Pd3LB6 with anionic guest G1 from MeCN, keeping pure Pd2LA4 in solution. When a mixture of homoleptic Pd3LB6 and heteroleptic Pd2LA2LB2 is exposed to a combination of two different di&#8208;anions (G1 and G2) in DMSO, selective guest uptake gives rise to two defined coexisting host&#8211;guest complexes. A joint experimental and deep theoretical investigation via liquid&#8208;state integral equation theory of the reaction thermodynamics on a molecular level accompanied by solvent distribution analysis hints at solvent expulsion from Pd2LA4 to favor the formation of Pd2LA2LB2 in DMSO as the key entropic factor for determining the solvent&#8208;specific modulation of the cage conversion equilibrium.

         <title>Fundamentals and Challenges of Ligand Modification in Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

By systematically reviewing the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios towards heterogeneous electrocatalysis, this work aims to propose methodological guidance from the preparation of ligand&#8208;modified catalysts and the regulation of interfacial properties, thus providing a potential protocol for promoting in&#8208;depth research and further applications of ligand&#8208;modified catalytic systems.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalytic materials in the energy field could promote the structural transformation from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ligand modification is an effective way to regulate both electronic and steric structures of catalytic sites, thus paving a prospective avenue to design the interfacial structures of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. Although great achievements have been obtained for the study and applications of heterogeneous ligand&#8208;modified catalysts, the systematical refinements of ligand modification strategies are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios by focusing on heterogeneous electrocatalysis. We elucidated the ligand&#8208;modified catalysts in detail from the perspectives of basic concepts, preparation, regulation of physicochemical properties of catalytic sites, and applications in different electrocatalysis. Notably, we bridged the electrocatalytic performance with the electronic/steric effects induced by ligand modification to gain intrinsic structure&#8208;performance relations. We also discussed the challenges and future perspectives of ligand modification strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Karl Ziegler &#8211; Early Career of a Scientist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Karl Ziegler is still known today for his outstanding achievements in chemical research, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963. But who was the person behind this brilliant scientist? This article outlines Ziegler's biography. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, his postdoctoral period and especially his role in the Nazi era.







Abstract
Karl Ziegler is considered one of the most outstanding chemists of the 20th century. In particular, his work on organometallic mixed catalysts, which allows the polymerization of ethylene at normal pressure, led to a revolution in plastics production and changed the everyday life of all mankind. In 1963, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, together with Giulio Natta. This article focuses on Ziegler's early career, which has received little attention to date. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, which partly coincide with the First World War. Subsequently, his postdoctoral period is examined, which led him via Marburg and Frankfurt to his first associate professorship in Heidelberg. Special attention is paid to his relationship to National Socialism, which he opposed. As a result, Ziegler experienced professional difficulties in the 1930s, such as repeated rejection when filling various professorships. His appointment as a full professor in Halle and his subsequent directorship at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung (Coal Research), where he finally achieved his greatest research achievement, are described in the following.

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) acts as a strong oxidant under visible light irradiation. This excited&#8208;state reactivity provides a potent manifold to perform heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of amines into imines under flow conditions with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. The inline generation of imine can be telescoped to Ugi&#8208;3CR under batch and flow conditions toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.







Abstract
Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8901;&#8722;)=+1.67&#8197;V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;Perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We determine the speciation in mechanosynthesized formamidinium (FA+) and rubidium (Rb+)&#8208;containing lead&#8208;halide perovskite formulations by NMR. We discover that a secondary non&#8208;perovskite Rb&#8208;based phase incorporates up to 60&#8201;% formamidinium.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3 in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+ or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+ dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+ does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use 1H&#8722;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+ incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5 and &#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the 1H and 87Rb chemical shifts, 1H&#8722;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and 87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60&#8201;% FA+ incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+ into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Chiral Helicene&#8208;Indenido ansa&#8208; and Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes and Their Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereocontrolled syntheses of chiral (oxa)helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich (Rh) or ansa&#8208;metallocene (Fe) complexes were developed. The enantio&#8208; and diastereopure half&#8208;sandwich Rh(III) complexes were used as catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation to form axially chiral biaryls in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er, and an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer was described.







Abstract
Despite recent tremendous progress in the synthesis of nonplanar chiral aromatics, and helicenes in particular, their conversion to half&#8208;sandwich or sandwich transition metal complexes still lags behind, although they represent an attractive family of modular and underexplored chiral architectures with a potential catalytic use. In this work, starting from various chiral helicene&#8208;indene proligands, we prepared the enantio&#8208; and diastereopure oxa[6]&#8208; and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhI and RhIII complexes and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;bisindenido ansa&#8208;metallocene FeII complex. To document their use, oxahelicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhIII complexes were employed as chiral catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to afford a series of axially chiral biaryls in mostly good to high yields and in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er. Thus, we developed stereocontrolled synthesis of chiral helicene&#8208;indenido ansa&#8208; and half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes, successfully demonstrated the first use of such helicene Cp&#8208;related metal complexes in enantioselective catalysis, and described an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

&lt;p&gt;Stereocontrolled syntheses of chiral (oxa)helicene-indenido half-sandwich (Rh) or &lt;i&gt;ansa&lt;/i&gt;-metallocene (Fe) complexes were developed.

         <title>Stereospecific 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement Interrupted Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI). Both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities by means of enantioselective allylic arylation and atroposelective alkenylation, respectively.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution with alkyl and heteroaryl carbon nucleophiles has been well&#8208;established. However, the asymmetric allylic arylation of acyclic internal alkenes with aryl nucleophiles remains challenging and underdeveloped. Herein we report a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI) that enables asymmetric allylic arylation. By means of this stepwise strategy, both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities. Experimental studies support a mechanism involving a cascade of asymmetric allylic amination, stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement and alkene isomerization. Density functional theory studies detailed the reasons of achieving the high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile helicenation of two (hetero) arenes linked by an alkynylcyclopropane: Weakly aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes from hydroarylation of heterole&#8208;substituted alkynylcyclopropanes reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative and controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening aromatization of the dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene gives the acylmethyl&#8208;shifted aromatization products, which are readily helicenated with the neighboring (hetero) arenes.







Abstract
In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero) arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method to evaluate bacterial electrochemical activity for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). By probing the intrinsic electric field (IEF) in outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes through the characteristic Raman properties of endogenous CO, we reveal a correlation between higher IEF and increased cell activity, enabling high&#8208;throughput bacterial screening.







Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29&#8197;V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot blending of a pair of tris&#8208;monodentate ligands and Pd(II) resulted in a mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;3D&#8208;cavity coordination cage, for the first time, as driven by orientational compatibility of ligand strands. Mixing Pd(II) with these ligands in separate&#8208;pots afforded homo&#8208;ligated cages where orientational compatibility of ligand strands is modulated by &#8220;neighbouring cage participation&#8221;.







Abstract
Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands in 3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.

However, one-pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris-monodentate ligands in 3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio produced an integratively self-sorted mixed-ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis-monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer-arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed-ligated double-cavity and the homo-ligated triple cavity cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Allylic Nitriles via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Cyanation of Biaryl Diallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitriles in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks.







Abstract
Axially chiral nitriles are common motifs in organic photoelectric materials, biological compounds, and agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the limited synthetic approaches to axially chiral nitriles have impeded their availability. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitrile structures in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that both steric and electronic interactions play crucial roles in determining the enantioselectivity of this transformation. Moreover, this mild and facile protocol is also applicable for gram&#8208;scale preparation of the chiral nitriles.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds in Organic Cathode Materials to Realize Ultra&#8208;stable, Flexible and Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding regulation strategy in organic cathode materials can realize ultra&#8208;stable, fast&#8208;charging/discharging, flexible, and low&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc&#8208;organic battery.







Abstract
Rational design of molecular structures is one of the effective strategies to obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials. However, besides the optimization of single&#8208;molecule structures, the influence of the &#8220;weak&#8221; interaction forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds) in organic cathode materials on the performance of batteries should be fully considered. Herein, three organic small molecules with different numbers of hydroxyl groups (namely nitrogen heterocyclic tetraketone (DAB), monohydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (HDA), dihydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (DHT)) were selected as the cathodes of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), and the effect of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds on their electrochemical performance was studied for the first time. Clearly, the stable hydrogen&#8208;bond networks built through the hydroxyl groups significantly enhance the cycle stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes and facilitate rapid proton conduction between the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks through the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby endowing them with excellent rate performance. In addition, a larger and more dense two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bond network can be constructed through multiple hydroxyl groups, further enhancing the structural stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes, giving them better cycle tolerance, excellent rate performance, and extreme environmental tolerance.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Site&#8208;Assisted Chain End Control Stereospecific Alternating Copolymerization of Chiral Cyclic Diesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfectly alternating sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization of cyclic esters with remarkably different reactivities be a challenge, in this work, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide, and a perfectly alternating copolymer with a high alternating level was achieved and exhibited a high break strain.







Abstract
Stereospecific alternating copolymerization of different chiral cyclic esters is one feasible approach to enrich the structural diversity of copolyesters and tailor their properties. However, dramatically different reactivities of different cyclic esters let a perfectly stereospecific alternating polymerization of these cyclic esters be a challenge, thus the catalyst is required to balance their reactivities. Herein, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was discovered and successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide (S, S&#8208;LA) and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide (R, R&#8208;EG)/R, R&#8208;propylglycolide (R, R&#8208;PG) during their heterospecific alternating copolymerization. The enantiomorphic site of R, R&#8208;SalenAl complex can increase the relative reactivity of R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG and suppress that of S, S&#8208;LA, then a perfectly alternating sequence of the copolymer of S, S&#8208;LA and R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG can be achieved (Palt=0.96/0.91); inversely, using S, S&#8208;SalenAl complex, the significant enantiomorphic site effect enlarges the reactivity difference of two monomers, the alternating level was just 0.70/0.68 even to 0.61. Poly(S, S&#8208;LA&#8208;alt&#8208;R, R&#8208;EG) with a high alternating regularity exhibits lower glass transition temperatures and a dramatically higher elongation at break (&#1013;B=449&#177;51&#8201;% (Palt=0.96) vs &#1013;B=6&#177;1% (Palt=0.70)).

         <title>The Photodynamic Agent Designed by Involvement of Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Enhancing Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) involving hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to enhance photodynamic therapy. As proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;based Type&#8208;I PS was developed, which produces carbon&#8208;centered radicals to oxidize NADH and generates superoxide radicals under light&#8208;irradiation. This PS exhibits strong photocytotoxicity under hypoxic conditions and excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Although Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type&#8208;I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;involved Type&#8208;I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon&#8208;centered radicals under light&#8208;irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene&#8208;substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light&#8208;irradiation, photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8901;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon&#8208;centered radical which is well characterized. The resulting carbon&#8208;centered radicals efficiently oxidize NADH by HAT reaction. This photosensitizer demonstrates remarkable photocytotoxicity even under hypoxic conditions, along with outstanding in vivo antitumor efficacy in mouse models bearing HeLa tumors. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by involvement of HAT.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Catalysis on Carbon Nanotubes in Electromicrofluidic Reactors: Monoterpene Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies on the cyclization of monoterpenes on carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic devices support that electric&#8208;field catalysis under scalable bulk conditions can stabilize both anionic and cationic transition states, can provide access to reactions general Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; catalysts do not to really catalyze, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products.







Abstract
The control over the movement of electrons during chemical reactions with oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) has been predicted to offer a general approach to catalysis. Recently, we suggested that many problems to realize electric&#8208;field catalysis in practice under scalable bulk conditions could possibly be solved on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic reactors. Here, we selected monoterpene cyclizations to assess the scope of our system in organic synthesis. We report that electric&#8208;field catalysis can function by stabilizing both anionic and cationic transition states, depending on the orientation of the applied field. Moreover, electric&#8208;field catalysis can promote reactions which are barely accessible by general Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and field&#8208;free anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products without the need for pyrene interfacers attached to the substrate to prolong binding to the carbon nanotubes. Finally, interfacing with chiral organocatalysts is explored and evidence against contributions from redox chemistry is provided.

         <title>Solvent Polarity&#8208;Induced Regulation of Cation Solvation Sheaths for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries with a 1.94 V Discharge Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient and universal strategy that utilizes solvent polarity&#8208;induced cation solvation sheath regulation to enhance the discharge voltage platform (up to 1.94&#8197;V) of Zn&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
To address the challenge of low discharge platforms (&lt;1.5&#8197;V) in aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries, highly concentrated salts have been explored due to their wide electrochemical window (~3&#8197;V). However, these electrolytes mainly prevent hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth at the anode without significantly enhancing voltage performance. Herein we introduce an approach by adjusting solvent polarity to regulate cation solvation sheaths in hybrid electrolytes, reducing Zn/Zn2+ oxidation potential and water activity. Through strong cation&#8208;water coordination and hydrogen bonding between dimethylsulfoxide and water, the designed electrolyte, at a low concentration, achieves a broader electrochemical window (4&#8197;V) than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Using this electrolyte, a Zn/Zn battery showed an impressive cycle life of 4340&#8197;cycles, while a Zn/lithium manganate battery delivered a high discharge platform of over 1.9&#8197;V with exceptional cycling stability. A Zn&#8208;based micro&#8208;battery with a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based hybrid electrolyte also achieved a record&#8208;high discharge platform of 1.94&#8197;V. This work presents a promising strategy for developing low&#8208;concentration electrolytes for high&#8208;performance sustainable energy storage.

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Click Chemistry Approach to Di&#8208;Ubiquitylate H1 Variants Reveals Position&#8208;Dependent Stimulation of the DNA Repair Protein RNF168</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a click chemistry approach to di&#8208;ubiquitylate histone H1 at relevant DNA repair&#8208;associated positions (H1KxUb2) to probe its effect on the E3 ligase RNF168. We demonstrate that H1KxUb2 stimulate RNF168 activity in vitro depending on the Ub2N3 attachment site on H1. Moreover, we show that H1K17Ub2 can recruit RNF168 to chromatin in cells, underlining the hypothesis that poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 directs RNF168 to DNA damaged sites.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysines 13 and 15 by the E3 ligase RNF168 plays a key role in orchestrating DNA double&#8208;strand break (DSB) repair, which is often deregulated in cancer. RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63&#8208;linked poly&#8208;ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly&#8208;ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site&#8208;specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole&#8208;linked di&#8208;ubiquitin on four DNA repair&#8208;associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position&#8208;dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di&#8208;ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U&#8208;2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.

         <title>Stabilisation of Bromenium Ions in Macrocyclic Halogen Bond Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first evidence of a macrocyclic effect for halenium (X+) ions is reported. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate the selective endotopic complexation of Br(I) species, remarkably facilitating the isolation of a stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; analogue and the first report of chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes. XRD studies of the macrocyclic Br(I) complexes and Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provide rare insight concerning halenium vs. metal cation coordination behaviors.







Abstract
Halenium ions (X+) are highly reactive electron deficient species that are prevalent transient intermediates in halogenation reactions. The stabilisation of these species is especially challenging, with the most common approach to sequester reactivity through the formation of bis&#8208;pyridine (Py) complexes; [(Py)2X]+. Herein, we present the first example of a macrocyclic stabilisation effect for halenium species. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate that preorganised macrocyclic ligands stabilise bromenium cations via endotopic complexation, impressively facilitating the isolation of a bench stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8722;&#8217; species. Solid state X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural comparison of macrocyclic Br(I) complexes with Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provides insightful information concerning similarities and stark contrasts in halenium/metal cation coordination behaviors. Furthermore, the first chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes are reported between acyclic [(Py)2Br]+ species and a bis&#8208;pyridine macrocyclic donor ligand which importantly highlights a macrocycle effect for halenium cation stabilisation in the solution phase.

         <title>Stable Xanthene Radicals and Their Heavy Chalcogen Analogues Showing Tunable Doublet Emission from Green to Near&#8208;infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues have been synthesized, which exhibit doublet emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527&#8211;714 nm) in solution and solid&#8208;state matrix. Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41% when doped into its precursor solid.







Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals, unlike traditional closed&#8208;shell fluorescent emitters, exhibit distinct luminescence mechanisms, offering promising potential for optoelectronic devices. To date, stable luminescent radicals have predominantly been confined to polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals, underscoring the need for new platforms to expand their emission spectra. In this study, we report the synthesis of stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues (1&#8201;a&#8211;c and 2&#8201;a&#8211;c), which exhibited excellent chemical stability and emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527&#8211;714&#8197;nm). Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical (1&#8201;c) demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41&#8201;% when doped into its precursor solid. Additionally, the introduction of methoxyphenyl groups has largely enhanced the stability of the radical, showcasing an excellent photostability with the longest half&#8208;life of around 1792&#8197;h. The high internal quantum efficiency of up to 81&#8201;% was further validated in organic light&#8208;emitting diode. This study introduces a novel class of stable carbon&#8208;centered radicals with high tunability and functionality for photoelectric applications.

Notably, the selenium-substituted radical demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41% when doped into its precursor solid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic luminescent radicals, unlike traditional closed-shell fluorescent emitters, exhibit distinct luminescence mechanisms, offering promising potential for optoelectronic devices. To date, stable luminescent radicals have predominantly been confined to polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals, underscoring the need for new platforms to expand their emission spectra. In this study, we report the synthesis of stable 9-aryl-substituted xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibited excellent chemical stability and emission ranging from green to near-infrared (527&#8211;714&#8197;nm). Notably, the selenium-substituted radical (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;) demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41&#8201;% when doped into its precursor solid. Additionally, the introduction of methoxyphenyl groups has largely enhanced the stability of the radical, showcasing an excellent photostability with the longest half-life of around 1792&#8197;h. The high internal quantum efficiency of up to 81&#8201;% was further validated in organic light-emitting diode. This study introduces a novel class of stable carbon-centered radicals with high tunability and functionality for photoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microfluidic Precision Manufacture of High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Microspheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic precision manufacture for high performance chromatographic microspheres was developed, with an unprecedented 100&#8201;% production yield, independent controllability of morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The microspheres&#8217; continuous adjustability of pore size enables resolution fine&#8208;tuning for protein chromatography. Microfluidic precision manufacture paves the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.







Abstract
A key bottleneck in developing chromatographic material is the chemically entangled control of morphology, pore structure, and material chemistry, which holds back precision material manufacture in order to pursue advanced separation performance. In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed, for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control over particle morphology, pore structure and material chemistry. The droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&lt;3&#8201;%), enabling a 100&#8201;% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re&#8208;optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of hmin=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine&#8208;tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super&#8208;throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high&#8208;performance droplet&#8208;synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced structural change of crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 films is investigated. Significant improvements in CO2&#8208;permeselectivity of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using an X&#8208;ray treatment method are demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
We report an X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;induced modification of the structure and gas permeation behavior of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. With 300&#8197;min irradiation time, CO2 permeance decreases by only 9&#8201;%, while N2 and CH4 permeances reduce by 75 and 65&#8201;%, respectively, leading to 3.7&#8208; and 2.6&#8208;fold enhancements in ideal selectivity for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4.

         <title>The Hidden Mechanism: Excited&#8208;State Proton&#8208;Electron Pair Transfer in Metal Nanocluster Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we explored the role of concerted electron&#8208;proton transfer (CEPT) in the luminescence of metal nanoclusters (NCs). CEPT can harness all available reaction energy and serves as a key limiting factor for the emission of metal NCs at physiological pH. Our findings also provide new insights into the pH&#8208;dependent luminescence of metal NCs, as the CEPT dynamics are closely correlated with the increase in transition state energy as pH decreases.







Abstract
Comprehending the underlying factors that govern photoluminescence (PL) in metal nanoclusters (NCs) under physiological conditions remains a highly intriguing and unresolved challenge, particularly for their biomedical applications. In this study, we evaluate the critical role of excited&#8208;state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer in the emission of metal NCs. Our findings demonstrate that hydronium ion (H3O+) binding can trigger a nonlinear, pH&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state concerted electron proton transfer (CEPT) reaction. This involves simultaneous electron transfer from the Au(0) core to the Au(I)&#8722;ATT (ATT denotes 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymidine) surface and proton transfer from H3O+ to the ATT ligand in a single step, greatly promoting vibrations and rotations of the Au(I)&#8722;ATT surface, resulting in substantial PL quenching of Au10(ATT)6 NCs. Further analyses show that the unique CEPT dynamics are strongly influenced by the opposing effects of increased reorganization energy and a larger pre&#8208;exponential factor on the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the proposed excited&#8208;state CEPT process is found to be prevalent in core&#8211;shell relaxation metal NCs, such as Au25(SR)18 (SR denotes thiolate) NCs, and serves as an important factor in limiting their PL emission. By simply controlling the pKa of the ligands, the emission performance of Au25(SR)18 can be easily regulated in physiological environments.

         <title>Highly Strained, Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Cyclophanes: Template&#8208;free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly strained porphyrin&#8208;based cyclophane (1) was synthesized using a template&#8208;free method starting from a porphyrin quinone (2). The neutral compound exhibits localized aromaticity, while its dicationic form demonstrates a combination of global aromaticity across the macrocycle and localized antiaromaticity within the porphyrin units.







Abstract
Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly&#160;Td&#160;symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;hybridized Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8208;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02%, surpassing the 13.31% achieved with Me&#8208;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered rings embedded in tetraphenylene derivatives and hetero&#8208;analogues exhibit unique properties and allow diverse applications. A conceptually viable and straightforward approach to these frameworks is [4+4] cycloaddition, which still remains elusive. In this study, we describe the stereoselective cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa&#8208;analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles were explored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expanded the inherently chiral library of medium&#8208;sized rings and also contributed to the advancement of asymmetric cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.</dc:description>

         <title>Declined Singlet&#160;but Constant Triplet&#160;Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap&#160;and high radiative constants&#160;are desired. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, which&#160;is at the expense of reducing radiative constants. Herein, we demonstrated a new singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation approach to construct TADF with high radiative constant, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted singlet&#160;but a constant triplet&#160;energy, and therefore reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that singlet&#160;state is delocalized while triplet&#160;state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is reduced from 0.60 eV, 0.46 eV to 0.25 eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 10^8/s) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (10^6 ~ 10^7/s). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics and material science.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes, etc. Small singlet-triplet energy gap&#160;and high radiative constants&#160;are desired. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor-acceptor molecular design, which&#160;is at the expense of reducing radiative constants. Herein, we demonstrated a new singlet-triplet energy gap modulation approach to construct TADF with high radiative constant, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red-shifted singlet&#160;but a constant triplet&#160;energy, and therefore reduced singlet-triplet energy gap controlled from monomer (IB), monomer-linker (IB-BF2), to dimer of IB-BF2-IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that singlet&#160;state is delocalized while triplet&#160;state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy gap is reduced from 0.60 eV, 0.46 eV to 0.25 eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 10^8/s) than that of conventional donor-acceptor molecules (10^6 ~ 10^7/s).

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Free Sulfate Groups in Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>General strategies for synthesizing sulfated oligosaccharides employ the protection of sulfate groups for glycosylation or post&#8208;sulfation after the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6&#8208;sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2&#8208;NTroc group or 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group using an ortho&#8208;hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;&#8208;glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2&#8208;NHTroc and 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6&#8208;position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxionium&#8208;cation via 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation. Additionally, glycosylation reactions under various counter cations of the sulfate group, such as Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+ and pyridinium were examined. Results showed that sodium and lithium salt donors yielded the products in good yield. These results were also supported by ab initio calculations. Practical glycosylation reactions between disaccharide donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with free sulfate groups successfully yielded the sulfated tetrasaccharides. This study also discusses how a sodium salt acts as a protecting group during glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors.  However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8208;7.5 &#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8208;6.5 &#197; along &#960;&#8208;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8208;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Single&#8208;Atom Modification of Hybrid Lead Chlorides for Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Effect and Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with intrinsic electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The covalent bonding between the electron&#8208;withdrawing organic groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitates charge separation but also enhances structural robustness, affording excellent photocatalytic activity in aerobic oxidation.







Abstract
Hybrid lead halides show significant potential in photocatalysis due to their excellent photophysical properties, but the atomically precise modification of their organic component to achieve synergistic interactions with the lead halide units remains a great challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have employed the crystal engineering strategy to construct a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The lead halide frameworks consist of 1D linear [PbCl]+ chains as inorganic building units and benzoxadiazole/benzothiadiazole/ benzoselenadiazole&#8208;funtionalized dicarboxylates as linkers. The covalent bonding between the organic ligands with electron&#8722;withdrawing groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitate the charge separation, but also enhance structural robustness that is critical for photocatalysis. The D&#8208;A structured lead halides serve as highly efficient heterogeneous photooxidation catalysts, including aerobic oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, oxidative coupling of primary amines, oxidation of phenylboronic acids and selective oxidation of sulfides that are demonstrated in 30 examples. Importantly, these photooxidation reactions are able to be driven by natural sunlight and ambient air to afford quantitative yields. Moreover, our lead halide photocatalysts are successful to fix into a photocatalytic flow system, which enables the flow&#8208;type synthesis of high value&#8208;added photooxidation products on a gram scale.

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a strategy to engineer active sites of supported Pt catalysts using WOx as stable oxide ligands, which selectively block Pt terraces. Adjusting the WOx coverage tunes the site composition, alters reactant adsorption, and shifts selectivity from the terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated pathways, as evidenced in furfural conversion.







Abstract
Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.

By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first-principles modeling, we show that the WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; coverage on Pt modifies the metal-to-acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal-acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support-dependent WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace- to step-dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyethylene Recycling via Water Activation by Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene degraded through an unreported reaction pathway, with water activation involved, resulting in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and ketones (Cn, n&#8818;50). The reaction was driven by ball milling, avoiding high temperature and pressurization. No noble&#8208;metal or complex catalysts were used. Only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n&#8818;50), with above 80&#8201;% of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Mg2IrH6, a predicted high temperature superconductor, the superconductivity results from the vibrations of the IrH64&#8722; molecules, whose eg* states are found near the Fermi level. In stark contrast, in Ca2IrH6 superconductivity is quenched via IrH64&#8722;&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation, as evidenced by a plot of the charge density of the occupied part of the metallic band, with contributions around Ca (yellow tetrahedra) and the molecular anion (blue octahedra).







Abstract
The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation Xn+ and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, have been identified as promising templates for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the anions IrH64&#8722; anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the

 set of orbitals, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir 

dx2-y2

 ${d_{x^2 - y^2 } }$



 or 

dz2

 ${d_{z^2 } }$



 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, 

eg*

 ${e_g^{\ast} }$



&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms, and may provide rules for identifying likely high&#8208;temperature superconductors in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.

         <title>Thermally Assisted Microfluidics to Produce Chemically Equivalent Microgels with Tunable Network Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally assisted microfluidics is utilized to produce thermoresponsive microgels with different network structures and morphologies. Monomers or star&#8208;polymers are used as microgel precursors at different temperatures. Microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offer a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Although micron&#8208;sized microgels have become important building blocks in regenerative materials, offering decisive interactions with living matter, their chemical composition mostly significantly varies when their network morphology is tuned. Since cell behavior is simultaneously affected by the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the gel network, microgels with variable morphology but chemical equivalence are of interest. This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.

         <title>Linker&#8208;Mediated Delocalized Excited States in Dimeric Acceptors Enable Efficient Exciton Dissociation with Negligible Energy&#8208;Level Offsets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkage mediates the molecular conformations of dimeric acceptors, influencing molecular assembly and promoting the generation of the delocalized singlet exciton. This strategy enables exciton dissociation at a near&#8208;zero energy offset, achieving 18&#8201;% power conversion efficiency and retaining 85&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after over 1400&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Efficient exciton dissociation at low energy offsets is key to overcoming voltage losses in organic solar cells. In this work, we developed two dimeric acceptors, i&#8208;YT and o&#8208;YT, by precisely controlling the position of an asymmetric electron&#8208;donating linker. It induced the foldamer conformation of i&#8208;YT with a para linkage (relative to the dicyano groups), while retaining the unfold conformation for o&#8208;YT. This subtle structural modification influenced the molecular assembly properties, enabled near&#8208;zero energy offset exciton dissociation and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 18&#8201;% for i&#8208;YT based organic solar cells. Detailed excitonic dynamics further revealed that the linker position critically influences three processes: the formation of delocalized singlet excited states, ultrafast charge transfer (~5&#8197;ps) in solid blends, and the suppression of exciton recombination. Additionally, devices based on i&#8208;YT demonstrated outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 85&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,400&#8197;hours of continuous illumination. These findings introduce a new class of dimeric acceptors that combine high efficiency with exceptional stability, offering a promising pathway toward low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes, synthetic vesicles mimicking cellular compartments, enable the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems such as microreactors and synthetic organelles. We report multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture formed through self&#8208;division, driven by the pH&#8208;triggered incorporation of a phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine tripeptide into the membrane. This process produces internal vesicles that colocalize enzymes, offering a method for engineering adaptive microreactors.







Abstract
Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi&#8208;compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre&#8208;formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture achieved through self&#8208;division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self&#8208;division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH&#8197;changes. This self&#8208;division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer&#8208;peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life&#8208;like properties.

     alt="Peptide-Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymersomes, synthetic vesicles mimicking cellular compartments, enable the creation of cell-like chemical systems such as microreactors and synthetic organelles. We report multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle-in-vesicle architecture formed through self-division, driven by the pH-triggered incorporation of a phenylalanine-phenylalanine-methionine tripeptide into the membrane. This process produces internal vesicles that colocalize enzymes, offering a method for engineering adaptive microreactors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell-like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi-compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre-formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle-in-vesicle architecture achieved through self-division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine-phenylalanine-methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self-division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH&#8197;changes. This self-division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer-peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life-like properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polar Order in a Fluid Like Ferroelectric with a Tilted Lamellar Structure &#8211; Observation of a Polar Smectic C (SmCP) Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of fluid states of matter with spontaneous bulk polar order is appreciated as a major discovery in the fields of soft matter and liquid crystals. Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop conventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase types. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen state of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it SmCP.







Abstract
The spontaneous polarisation of the SmCP phase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional ferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce the proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of experimental and simulated X&#8208;ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement. The materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than typical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of molecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated, a view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.

         <title>&#8216;Invisible&#8217; Molecular Dynamics Revealed for a Conformationally Chiral &#960;&#8208;Stacked Perylene Bisimide Foldamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interconversion of perylene bisimide (PBI) foldamer via an open meta&#8208;stable state into stereoisomers is normally &#8216;invisible&#8217; under equilibrium. We designed a kinetically trapped out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conformationally chiral PBI folda&#8208;dimer and used UV/Vis, NMR, CD and CPL spectroscopy to observe the opening and re&#8208;folding processes.







Abstract
Whilst energetic and kinetic aspects of folding processes are meanwhile well understood for natural biomacromolecules, the folding dynamics in so far studied artificial foldamer counterparts remain largely unexplored. This is due to the low energy barriers between their conformational isomers that make the dynamic processes undetectable with conventional methods such as UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy, making such processes &#8216;invisible&#8217;. Here we present an asymmetric perylene bisimide dimer (bis&#8208;PBI&#160;1) that possesses conformational chirality in its folded state. Owing to the large interconversion barrier (&#8805;116&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), four stereoisomers could be separated and isolated. Since the interconversion between these stereoisomers requires the foldamer to first open and then to re&#8208;fold, the transformation of one stereoisomer into others allowed us to &#8216;visualize&#8217; the dynamics of folding with time and determine its lifetimes and the energetic barriers associated with the folding process. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, we identified the open structure to be only a fleetingly metastable state of higher energy. Our experimental observation of the kinetics associated with the molecular dynamics in the PBI foldamer advances the fundamental understanding of folding in synthetic foldamers and paves the way for the design of smart functional materials.

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly (ISA) approach, where organic monomers are synthesized and simultaneously assembled into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks under consistent solvent conditions, resulting in the successful creation of a series of isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with tunable pore sizes and microenvironment.







Abstract
Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Regeneration of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Catalysis Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural collapse and the metal dissolution have limited the durability of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxygen pump strategy can efficiently restrain the collapse. The oxygen pump Ni4Mo provides electrons and oxygenous species for NiFe&#8208;LDH, boosting the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, so as to enhance the durability.







Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe&#8208;LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe&#8208;LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressive durability for over 60&#8197;h, much longer than that of NiFe&#8208;LDH counterpart with only 10&#8197;h. In situ spectra and first&#8208;principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH&#8722; is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of an Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorogenic Platform for In Vivo Orthotopic Tumor Imaging and Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have proposed a general fluorescent platform for designing activatable probes, and the representative probe termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE where 4&#8208;hydroxyl mandelic acid has three conjugating sites linked by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophore, a recognition moiety and a quencher. This probe could be well NIR light&#8208;activated and successfully guide the tumor resection, which may be extended to design other activatable probes for biomedical application.







Abstract
Rational and effective design of a universal near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbed platform employed to prepare diverse activatable NIR fluorogenic probes for in&#8197;vivo imaging and the imaging&#8208;guided tumor resection remains less exploited but highly meaningful. Herein, mandelic acid with a core structure of 4&#8208;hydroxylbenzyl alcohol to link recognition unit, a fluorophore and a quencher was employed to prepare activatable probes. We exemplified ester as carboxylesterase (CE)&#8208;recognized unit, ferrocene as quencher and phenothiazinium as NIR fluorophore to afford fluorogenic probes termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE and NBS&#8208;C&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE. These probes enabled the conversion toward CE with significant fluorescence increases and successfully discriminate CE activity in cells. NIR light enhances the tumor penetration and enable imaging&#8208;guided orthotopic tumor resection. This specific case demonstrated that this platform can be effectively used to construct diverse NIR probes for imaging analytes in biological systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Fluorescence Polyelectrolyte Nanoassemblies: Manipulate and Boost Singlet Oxygen in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on how to conquer the two major problems in clinical PDT: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Here we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling strategy that bestows a unique &#8220;confining isolated&#8221; inner microenvironment, which has for the first time allowed to synergistically manipulate and boost 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic modality that has shown great potential for cancer treatment. However, there exist two major problems hindering PDT applications: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Herein, we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling (photo&#8208;triggered PPN) strategy, in which porphyrin photosensitizer and photoswitchable energy accepter are assembled into polyelectrolyte micelles by a combined force of charge interaction and metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The polyelectrolyte&#8208;based PPN exhibits good biocompatibility, and bestows a unique &#8220;confining isolated&#8221; inner microenvironment for fully overcoming the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrins with significant photodynamic efficiency (123&#8208;fold enhancement). Due to the high F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (91.5&#8201;%) between porphyrin and photoswitch in closed&#8208;form, we could use light as a specific trigger to modulate photoswitch between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;form, and manipulate the 1O2 generation in three stages: pre&#8208;PDT (quenching 1O2 generation), during PDT (activating 1O2 generation), and post&#8208;PDT (silencing 1O2 generation). This de novo strategy has for the first time realized remotely manipulating and boosting 1O2 generation in PDT, well resolving the critical and general challenges of limited photodynamic efficiency and side effects from nonspecific phototoxicity.

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19:1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron "reservoir" that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (9.8 times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95% after 6 h.</dc:description>

         <title>GlutaR: A&#160;High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity, and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed&#160;in situ&#160;titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of GS and GLS differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR&#8217;s ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice&#160;in vivo.&#160;These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real-time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP-cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine-induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity, and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed&#160;in situ&#160;titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of GS and GLS differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments.

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter "RDC" to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super&#160;blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene, and the maximum selectivity for branched alkanes reported up to date is about 70%. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8208;C13) with yield of 73.3% over SO42&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280 &#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1% within the C4&#8208;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus via electronic effects of organic functional groups for enhanced hydrogen production activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP&#8217;s band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8208;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8208;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1 e&#8208; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80 V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3 e&#8208; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8208;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8208;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1 e&#8208;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1 e&#8208; to 3 e&#8208;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8208;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3 mmol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 35 and 8 times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8208;WOv with 0.077 min&#8208;1 of rate constant, 38 times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.</dc:description>

         <title>Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reactivity with Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides for the Synthesis of Heteroaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis acid activation promotes the addition of nucleophilic heterocycles to sulfondiimidoyl fluorides to provide a broad range of heteroaryl sulfondiimines. This new SuFEx reactivity capitalizes on mild reaction conditions to achieve high functional group tolerance. The imidic N&#8208;substituents are shown to modulate reactivity at the sulfur&#8208;center.







Abstract
Sulfur functional groups are ubiquitous in molecules used in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and within these collections sulfones hold a prominent position. The double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfones, sulfondiimines, offer significant potential in discovery chemistry but to date their applications have been limited by the lack of convenient synthetic routes. The existing methods mainly rely on imination of low&#8208;valent&#8208;sulfur intermediates, or the combination of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents and electrophilic S(VI)&#8208;functionalities. Herein, we describe a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides with (hetero)aryls. This new SuFEx reactivity benefits from broad functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and does not require the use of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents. The efficient use of unprotected indoles and pyrroles, as well as furan, thiophene and carbocyclic aromatics, further demonstrates the advantages of these reactions. We show that the reactivity of the sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be tuned by switching the N&#8208;substituents, allowing an expansion of the range of coupling partners. The utility of the transformation is exemplified by the synthesis of the sulfondiimine analogue of the HIV&#8208;I reverse transcriptase&#8208;inhibitor L&#8208;737,126.

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Using a New&#160;Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy = 3&#8208;chloropyridine, X = BF4&#8208;, OTf&#8208;, NO3&#8208;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5 hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates are&#160; interesting candidates for supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in&#160;energy conversion or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a polyoxometalate covalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8208;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8208;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Glycan Presentation in Liquid&#8208;Ordered or &#8208;Disordered Membrane Phases and its Effect on Lectin Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of sequence&#8208;defined, lipidated glycomimetics was synthesized and incorporated into phase&#8208;separating GUVs to mimic cellular lipid rafts. Depending on the lipid anchor, the glycomimetics partition into either the Lo or Ld domain of the vesicles, enabling the construction of spatially defined glycocalyx models. Moreover, ligands in the Lo domain were shown to engage more effectively in lectin recruitment than those in the Ld domain.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;protein interactions play a key role in various biological processes from fertilization to infections. Many of these interactions take place at the glycocalyx&#8212;a heavily glycosylated layer at the cell surface. Despite its significance, studying the glycocalyx remains challenging due to its complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature. This study introduces a glycocalyx model allowing for the first time to control spatial organization and heterogeneity of the glycan moieties. Glycan&#8208;mimetics with lipid&#8208;moieties that partition into either liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo, lipid rafts) or liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phases of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which serve as simplified cell membrane models mimicking lipid rafts, are developed. This phase&#8208;specific allocation allows controlled placement of glycan motifs in distinct membrane environments, creating heteromultivalent systems that replicate the natural glycocalyx's complexity. We show that phase localization of glycan mimetics significantly influences recruitment of protein receptors to the membrane. Glycan&#8208;conjugates in the ordered phase demonstrate enhanced lectin binding, supporting the idea that raft&#8208;like domains facilitate stronger receptor interactions. This study provides a platform for systematically investigating spatial and dynamic presentation of glycans in biological systems and presents the first experimental evidence that glycan accumulation in lipid rafts enhances receptor binding affinity, offering deeper insights into the glycocalyx&#8216;s functional mechanisms.

         <title>Dual Ion Co&#8208;Insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative electrolyte regulation strategy is developed to improve the performance of KCo[Fe(CN)6] cathode in aqueous zinc ion battery. The dissolution of high&#8208;spin metal ion (Co) in KCo[Fe(CN)6] is suppressed. The dual ion co&#8208;insertion induces a novel and reversible phase conversion reaction in which low&#8208;spin atom (Fe) in KCo[Fe(CN)6] are replaced. An ultra&#8208;long life aqueous zinc ion battery is achieved.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and dissolution of high&#8208;spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co&#8208;inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co&#8208;insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low&#8208;spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and metal&#8208;ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% over 4400&#8197;cycles at 40&#8197;C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co&#8208;intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Ethylene Glycol Oxidization Coupled with Hydrogen Generation Using Metal Oxide Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), achieving a faradic efficiency for formate production exceeding 85&#8201;% along with long&#8208;term stability. Additionally, we constructed an unassisted PEC tandem device that simultaneously facilitates EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a Cu2O photocathode.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents a promising approach for harnessing solar energy and transforming it into storable hydrogen. However, the complicated 4&#8208;electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO4/NiCo&#8208;LDH photoanode with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm2.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we developed a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), achieving a faradic efficiency for formate production exceeding 85&#8201;% along with long-term stability. Additionally, we constructed an unassisted PEC tandem device that simultaneously facilitates EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanode with a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photocathode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents a promising approach for harnessing solar energy and transforming it into storable hydrogen. However, the complicated 4-electron transfer process of water oxidation reaction imposes kinetic limitations on the overall efficiency. Herein, we proposed a strategy by substituting water oxidation with the oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), which is a hydrolysis byproduct of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. To achieve this, we developed and synthesized BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanodes capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 85&#8201;% for the oxidation of EG to formate in a strongly alkaline environment. The reaction mechanism was further elucidated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we successfully constructed an unassisted PEC device for EG oxidation and hydrogen generation by pairing the translucent Mo&#8201;:&#8201;BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH photoanode with a state-of-the-art Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photocathode, resulting in an approximate photocurrent density of 2.3&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our research not only offers a PEC pathway for converting PET plastics into valuable chemicals but also enables simultaneous hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Molecular Dispersion of Crown Ether&#8208;Decorated Cobalt Phthalocyanine on Carbon Nanotubes for Robust CO2 Reduction through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8208;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and K+ is able to simultaneously eliminate catalyst aggregation and stabilize catalyst/support interfaces, leading to a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. The catalytic interfaces show unchanged intrinsic activity at all loading conditions, breaking the trade&#8208;off between intrinsic activity and extrinsic activity.







Abstract
Immobilizing molecular catalysts on electro&#8208;conductive supports (for example, multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes, CNTs) represent a promising way to well&#8208;defined catalyst/support interfaces, which has shown appreciable performance for catalytic transformation. However, their full potential is far from achieved due to insufficient utilization of the intrinsic activity for each immobilized molecular catalyst, especially at loadings that should allow decent current densities. In the present work, we discover host&#8211;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and metal ions, for example K+ ions, not only eliminate catalyst aggregation at immobilization procedures but also reinforce catalyst/support interactions by additional electrostatic attractions under operational conditions. Through simple dip&#8208;coating procedures, a successful single molecular dispersion is achieved. Such a catalyst/electrode interface is stable and can selectively catalyze CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with Faradaic efficiency over 96%. Importantly, this interface maintains an almost unchanged turnover frequency (TOF) across all loading conditions, implying a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. Therefore, a simultaneous achievement of high TOF and high current density (TOF of 111&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is achieved, in an aqueous H&#8208;type electrolyzer at an overpotential of 570&#8197;mV.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO3 by Surface Oxidation of Mo2C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of MoO3 and Mo2C was achieved by in situ growing MoO3 on the interlayer and surface of Mo2C MXene. Through depth profiling, a unique near&#8208;surface reaction was found, which enabled Mo2C to provide a durable conductive skeleton and ion diffusion channel for MoO3, making Mo2C/MoO3 composites exhibit excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5&#8197;mAh/g for 200&#8197;cycles). The mechanism of H+/Al3+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction was studied. The first&#8208;principle calculation showed that Mo2C improved the MoO3 reaction kinetics. As a result, Mo2C/MoO3 batteries have higher specific capacity and stability. This work provides insights for improving the AAIBs cathode and expanding the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in water&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3 faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in situ growing MoO3 on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3 reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3 achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3 composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5&#8197;mAh/g after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.4&#8197;A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through ex situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3 reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIBs cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Strengthen Water O&#8722;H Bond in Electrolytes for Enhanced Reversibility and Safety in Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrated that the water activity of AAIBs can be effectively suppressed by elevating the electron density of water protons through interactions with exceptionally polar additives. Simultaneously, this strategic approach alleviates aluminum corrosion in the hybrid electrolyte, widens the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte, and effectively resolves the flammability issue associated with organic additives.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries present a promising prospect for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to the abundance, inherent safety, and the high theoretical capacity of aluminum. However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in&#8208;depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water&#8208;poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O&#8208;mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while retaining 71&#8201;% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first &#960;&#8208;complexes derived from non&#8208;classical diboriranes (three&#8208;membered aromatic B2C rings) and their carbonylative ring expansion to four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered cyclic ligands. The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; R&#8217;=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to an allylic &#960;&#8208;complex, which further reacts under side&#8208;on addition of CO to the B&#8722;B moiety to an &#951;5&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring. For R&#8217;=SnMe3, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond.







Abstract
Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R=H, SnMe3; Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion under formation of a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules.

The H-bridged diborirane (R=2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl; R&#8217;=H) initially reacts with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; to an allylic &#960;-complex, which further reacts under side-on addition of CO to the B&#8722;B moiety to an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated five-membered B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ring. For R&#8217;=SnMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CO is added end-on to the B&#8722;B bond.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non-classical H&#252;ckel-aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#960;-system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non-classical diboriranes cyclo-&#956;-RB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Dur&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh (R=H, SnMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; Dur=2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C ring to either four- or five-membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3-center-2-electron bond (3c2e): The H-bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; to the allylic &#960;-complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; results in the side-on ring expansion under formation of a five-membered B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl-bridged diborirane (R=SnMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) under the same conditions, CO is added end-on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn 3c2e-bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt; clusters, respectively, according to the Wade-Mingos rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Signature of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity through Spontaneous Resolution of 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate the first instance of achieving dual signature of chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity in 2D metal&#8211;organic framework materials, produced from a single and exclusively achiral system through spontaneous resolution method.







Abstract
The Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon within the realm of electron's spin manipulation, showcasing a unique interplay between electron's spin and molecular chirality. Subsequent to its discovery, researchers have been actively involved in exploring the new chiral molecules as effective spin filters. In the realm of observing the CISS effect, the conventional approach has mandated the utilization of two distinct enantiomers of chiral molecules. However, this present study represents a significant advancement by demonstrating the ability to control both spin states of electrons in a single system. In this work, we have demonstrated the preparation of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a &#8220;spontaneous resolution&#8221; process, obviating the requirement for chiral sources. This resulted in the production of chiral crystals exhibiting opposite handedness (1P and 1M) and these crystals were subsequently employed as a new class of spin filters based on CISS effect. Remarkably, this work signifies the first instance of achieving dual signature of spin selectivity from a single and exclusively achiral system through a spontaneous resolution process. This holds immense potential as it facilitates the production of two distinct spin&#8208;filtering materials from a unified system. Furthermore, we investigated the contact potential differences (CPD) of these chiral crystals and, for the first time, associated it with the preferential spin transport properties. Our findings revealed a correlation between the CPD and the chirality of the crystals, as well as the magnetization orientations of the ferromagnetic substrate, which can be elucidated by the CISS effect. In overall, the significant findings achieved using these robust and easily synthesized MOF crystals without the requirement for chiral medium represent a crucial advancement in enhancing the effectiveness of spin filtering materials to produce spintronic devices.

         <title>Removal of Residual Additive Enabling Perfect Crystallization of Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron delocalization effect is innovatively utilized to optimize the interaction between additives and PbI2, ensuring the regulation of the crystallization process while effectively avoiding the negative effects caused by additive residual. This strategy further enhanced the device performance, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.95&#8201;%.







Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinges on the precise control of the perovskite film crystallization process, often improved by the inclusion of additives. While dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is traditionally used to manage this process, its removal from the films is problematic. In this work, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO) was employed instead of DMSO to slow the crystallization rate, as MPSO is more easily removed from the perovskite structure. The electron delocalization associated with the benzene ring in MPSO decreases the electron density around the oxygen atom in the sulfoxide group, thus reducing its interaction with PbI2. This strategy not only sustains the formation of a crystallization&#8208;slowing intermediate phase but also simplifies the elimination of the additive. Consequently, the optimized PSCs achieved a leading power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95&#8201;% along with exceptional stability. This strategy provides a novel method for fine&#8208;tuning perovskite crystallization to enhance the overall performance of photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Cluster&#8208;based Spin Crossover Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive cluster transformations in the cluster&#8208;based spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are firstly realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation, which are accompanied by the topological changes from 3,4,6&#8208;T108 to urk and magnetic modulations.







Abstract
Cluster&#8208;based spin crossover (SCO) frameworks are a new class of smart metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse structures and topologies and unique bistable physicochemical properties. Here, we report a cluster&#8208;based SCO framework [Fe3{Ag4(CN)6(H2O)}2(TPBA)3](ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7DMF (1) with an extremely rare 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology, in which the tripodal [Ag{Ag(CN)2}3(H2O)]2&#8722; clusters axially link the Fe2+ ions to form 2D&#8594;3D n&#8208;fold Borromean entangled networks. Under the guidance of reticular chemistry, the post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) from 1 with 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology to [Fe3{Ag8X8(CN)6}(TPBA)3] (2_X, X=Cl, Br, I) with urk topology is firstly achieved via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Moreover, the successive SCSC transformations from 2_Cl to 2_Br and then to 2_I are realized for the first time. Their SCO behaviors are also modified by halogen&#8208;driven stepwise cluster transformations. Hence, these findings provide new strategies for the development of cluster&#8208;based SCO MOFs towards the smart functional porous materials.

         <title>Encapsulation of an Au25 Nanocluster inside a Porphyrin Nanoring Enhances Singlet Oxygen Generation and Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8208;guest system formed by binding atomically precise Au nanoclusters inside zinc porphyrin nanorings has been studied. The assembly is based on the interaction between the zinc porphyrin units and the pyridine ligands of the cluster. The assembly shows increased stability and (electro&#8722;)photo catalytic activities in CO2 reduction to CO and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation compared to the pristine cluster.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecular host&#8211;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.

         <title>Accelerated First&#8208;Principles Exploration of Structure and Reactivity in Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches to computational chemistry provide atomistic insight into graphene oxide. This work showcases how ML potentials can be fitted by combining accelerated first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics and graph neural&#8208;network models. Large&#8208;scale simulations, driven by the resulting potential, reveal how functional groups in a graphene oxide sheet evolve and graphitic domains form during thermal reduction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic&#8208;scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine&#8208;learning methods, combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly acceleration for first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics with message&#8208;passing neural&#8208;network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten&#8208;nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Activation of DNAzyme Nanoassembly for Synergistically Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA nanoassembly with a built&#8208;in RNA walker system was programmed for endogenous miR&#8208;10b&#8208;triggered successive decaging of therapeutic DNAzyme, and the as&#8208;integrated negative feedback loop could counteract the overexpressed TWIST/miR&#8208;10b for abrogated tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
DNAzyme represents a promising gene silencing toolbox yet is obstructed by the poor substrate accessibility in specific cells. Herein, a compact DNA nanoassembly, incorporating multimeric therapeutic DNAzyme, was prepared for selective delivery of gene&#8208;silencing DNAzyme with requisite cofactors and auxiliary chemo&#8208;drugs. By virtue of the sequence&#8208;conservative duplex&#8208;specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR&#8208;10b&#8208;stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR&#8208;10b, thus acquiring the self&#8208;sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR&#8208;10b signaling nodes (self&#8208;adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance issues.

         <title>Paired&#160;Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emitting Copper(I) Indenediyltrisphosphine Complexes with Minimized Skeletal Vibrations and Configurational Disorder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials.&#160;Particularly for the red&#160;emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color.&#160;For example, the red color (lem&#160;=&#160;616&#8211;677 nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl backbone (ITP).&#160;Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of&#160;ITP&#8208;MX&#160;and&#160;the&#160;congeners, showcasing genuinely deep&#8208;red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56 nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader&#8208;emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds of PS. We show herein that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS susbstrates into benzoic acid (BAc) up to 40%, with small proportions of acetophenone and formic acid, under visible light (456 nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77% of the photons absorbed vs. 1% for the direct reaction with PS. These results suggest a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photocycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9% and 91.4% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that give access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850 nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen persul&#64257;de (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2)&#160; for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#160;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. &#160;As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.4 mA cm&#8211;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2% at 0.8 mA cm&#8211;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19 mg cm&#8211;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)-catalyzed &#963;-bond cross-exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl- as well as alkenyl-, but also alkyl-substituted diaziridines (up to 98% yield). Conducting a scale-up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc-based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96% ee).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability, with current densities of 8 mA cm&#8211;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and absorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Molecular Crystals Derived from Cofacial Porphyrin/Phthalocyanine Heterodimers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based porous materials are of growing interest as heterogeneous catalysts especially for
reactions that are of importance to sustainability. Here we demonstrate that porous molecular crystals
can be prepared by the simple co&#8208;crystallisation of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) with octa(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenoxy)
phthalocyanine or some of its metal complexes [(dipPhO)8PcM; M = H2, Al&#8208;OH,
Ti=O, Mn&#8208;Cl, Fe&#8208;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8208;Cl, Ag, In&#8208;Cl or Au&#8208;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the
efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is
driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM
component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous
Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of
TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals
containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the in&#8208;situ addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl
to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller
surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g&#8208;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g&#8208;1. The reactivity of both
macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals are demonstrated by in&#8208;situ metal insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Activated Dynamic Condensation Approach to Narrow&#8208;Band Gap Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl units intrinsically featuring less steric, nonpolarity, and unsaturated character, are well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;bridge used in the synthesis of high&#8208;performance semiconducting materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a promising class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, however, the range of available monomers for the reversible formation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds remains limited. In this study, a new class of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized using dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole&#160;(DM&#8208;DPP) as the key monomer. The strong electron deficiency of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) makes its methyl substituents readily activated upon the cocatalysis of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution to conduct dynamic condensation with tritopic aromatic aldehydes. The resulting COFs crystallized in an eclipsed AA stacking arrangement and featured abundant, regular nanochannels. Their robust vinyl DPP&#8208;linking mode enhanced donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugation and promoted &#960;&#8208;stacked alignment along the vertical direction. Consequently, the synthesized COFs exhibited band gaps as narrow as 1.02 eV and demonstrated excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability across the visible to near&#8208;infrared I (NIR&#8208;I) regions. Furthermore, the COFs could be converted into free&#8208;standing thin pellets through simple pressure casting, and show excellent photothermal response and cycling stability under different light sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Stable Decomposition Products on Cathode Surfaces to Enable High Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5 V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Here, we devise an effective, conformal and thin coating on the cathode active material guided by density functional theory, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8208;4.3 V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Stereoselective Synthesis of Hexa&#8208;aryl Borazines and their sp&#178;&#8208;Based 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borazine and its derivatives can be considered critical doping units for engineering hybrid C(sp2)&#8208;based molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties. Herein, we report the first synthesis of&#160;hexaarylborazines that, bearing&#160;ortho&#8208;substituted aryl moieties, extend three&#8208;dimensionally.&#160;Using a one&#8208;pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent, we can guide the ArLi to add to the BN&#8208;core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that&#160;when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long&#8208;range&#160;ortho&#8208;substituents&#160;are used,&#160;i.e.,&#160;stiff substituents. The&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3&#160;core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add&#160;anti&#160;at each addition step, forming the final tri&#8208;aryl borazine exclusively as&#160;cc&#8208;isomer.&#160;Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior.&#160;This methodology paves the way for previously inaccessible borazines to serve as&#160;privileged precursors&#160;to transcend the conventional bidimensionality associated with graphenoid systems and pioneer the construction of new forms of three&#8208;dimensional C(sp2)&#8208;based architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; and one 2&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system, enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Here, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50 = 5 mM to 25 nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350 nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75 &#176;C for 2.5 h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in&#8208;situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500 h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5 Ah cm&#8208;2 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3 &#177; 3.1 MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5% = 376 &#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Replaces Weak: &#8203;Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Anchored Electrolyte Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4 V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8208;20 ~ 60 &#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) &#160;demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations&#160; confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 2.28 times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24 times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling&#160; S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8208;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under Coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85 &#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain-limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under Coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85 &#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non-radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55% than the control devices (23.03%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upcycling iron oxide scale slag into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable ozone catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70% Fe2O3 and 40.30% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8315;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59 &#956;g&#183;L&#8208;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Tunable Ring Expansion Enabled By A Single&#8208;Component Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable installation of a single nitrogen atom is central to many major goals in skeletal editing, with progress often gated by the availability of an appropriate N&#8208;atom source. Here we introduce a novel reagent, termed DNIBX, based on dibenzoazabicycloheptadiene (dbabh), which allows the electrophilic installation of dbabh to organic substrates. When indanone &#946;&#8208;ketoesters are aminated by DNIBX, the resulting products undergo divergent ring expansions depending on the mode of activation, producing heterocycles in differing oxidation states under thermal and photochemical conditions. The mechanism of each transformation is discussed, and the different reactivity modes of the indanone&#8208;dbabh adducts are compared to other nitrogenous precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>

         <dc:description>
Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL-33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper-expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small-molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP-targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP-targeting G-quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1-VHLL). Sc1-VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1-VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1-VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

The &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS-II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF-ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl-ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3-helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8-ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow-spectrum antibacterial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

         <title>Hyperconjugation&#8208;Driven Isodesmic Reaction of Indoles and Anilines: Reaction Discovery, Mechanism Study, and Antitumor Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines was developed in this work. The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional-group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five-membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.

&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines are valuable blocks in various biologically active molecules.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>

The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>

The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts. Our method offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities that expand the pyridine modification toolbox and provide access to challenging meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors. In this study, we report a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms are introduced at the outer &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. SA1 exhibits a deep HOMO level of &#8722;5.51&#8197;eV, a wide bandgap of 1.81&#8197;eV and suitable miscibility with the polymer acceptor. Polymer chains incorporating F&#8208;BTI result in a highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within the all&#8208;polymer active layer. Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Lodged High&#8208;Valent High&#8208;Entropy Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient, Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

However, the current state-of-the-art n-i-p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;-tetrakis(N,N-di-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dopant and hydrophilic Li-TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro-type HTM with a critical quasi-planar core (&lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt;) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller-like conformation in spiro-OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi-planar HTMs interact with the Pb-dimer. Consequently, the device using &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; achieves a higher &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro-OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double-column &#960;&lt;i&gt;&#8211;&lt;/i&gt;&#960; stacking of &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; results in high hole mobility (~10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) even without &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD, those with &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; exhibit enhanced stability under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi-planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&lt;i&gt;&#8211;&lt;/i&gt;&#960; intermolecular stacking in &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt;. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro-type HTMs incorporating quasi-planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO&#8208;140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch&#8208;type CaMnO&#8208;140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>

The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

         <title>Screening Strategy Identifies an Overlooked Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

Small Fish, big moves In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

In this context, we present a novel Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1-chloro-substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1-disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step-economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture- and air-sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1-chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

         <title>A Paramagnetic Nickel&#8211;Zinc Hydride Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been charactertised in the solid&#8208;state and in solution. EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution and hint that the coordination event may be reversible.







Abstract
Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6-di-isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3-centre,2-electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been charactertised in the solid-state and in solution. EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution and hint that the coordination event may be reversible.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6-di-isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3-centre,2-electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been characterized in the solid-state by single crystal X-ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;-complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous-wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D-exchange with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208;Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the first NHC ligand&#8208;enabled Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction to obtain axial and P&#8208;chiral phosphines. The product can undergo a SNAr reaction with many nucleophiles for the rapid synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Drive Tandem Electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

Using this method, mixtures of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late-stage C&#8722;H functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we disclose a simple copper-catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1-aryl-2-alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.
