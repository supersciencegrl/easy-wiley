         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homo&#8208;coupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8208;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8208;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#8211;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#8211;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favoured side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#8211;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#8211;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Postfunctionalization of Poly(methacrylate) Derivatives via Radical&#8211;Polar Crossover Phosphonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization of poly(meth)acrylate&#8208;based copolymers bearing phthalimide moieties can produce novel polymer architectures that are inaccessible using polymerization approaches; however, this method is restricted to radical reactions. To expand the scope of reactions applicable to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization, this study focused on the radical&#8211;polar crossover process, in which a carbocation equivalent is generated to react with nucleophiles. The organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a random copolymer of N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide and methyl acrylate using trialkyl phosphite nucleophiles afforded the corresponding phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers. Although simultaneous hydrogenation was inevitable, a novel polymer comprising dialkyl isopropenylphosphonate, propylene, and methyl acrylate units was obtained, which is of interest because phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers are potentially applicable as thermoresponsive materials, flame&#8208;retardant materials, and additives in Li&#8208;ion batteries. A series of copolymers with different components were successfully applied to the postfunctionalization method. The organophotoredox catalysis&#8211;based postfunctionalization strategy developed in this study provides versatile functional polymers in a simple, green, and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally&#8208;sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.</dc:description>

         <title>Tri&#8208;coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward systhesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalyst commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell, and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8208;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#8722;O&#8722;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#8722;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angle of O&#8722;B&#8722;O and B&#8722;O&#8722;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly on molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#8722;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Boron-based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward systhesis of confined boron-based catalyst commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low-temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell, and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron-oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#8722;O&#8722;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri-coordinated B&#8722;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angle of O&#8722;B&#8722;O and B&#8722;O&#8722;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly on molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#8722;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0 V. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ two&#8208;dimensional EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it&#8217;s increased sensitivity towards hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker&#8217;s reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate.&#160;&#160;Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Aldehyde&#8208;Copper&#8208;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &gt;20:1 dr and &gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the types and locations of interactions between atoms or molecules within a chemical system is a fundamental concern in chemistry. In the field of theoretical and computational chemistry, wavefunction analysis offers various methods based on functions defined in three&#8208;dimensional real space, enabling the visual representation of both covalent and noncovalent interactions. These methods provide researchers with an intuitive understanding of molecular interactions and are gaining increasing attention. This review systematically introduces various widely adopted and distinctive visualization methods, such as the noncovalent interaction (NCI) method, the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular density (IGMH), the interaction region indicator (IRI), the electrostatic potential (ESP), the electron localization function (ELF), and deformation density.

         <title>Dopant And Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification Of Charge Density And C&#8208;C Coupling Sites For Efficient CO2 Photoreduction To Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped ABPS catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Despite its widely appreciated significance, most research on mental health is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. This contribution intends to enhance discussion between those disciplines and the STEM field by pointing toward relevant studies, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A spiro&#8208;conformation&#8208;driven neutral ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)2], is reported by Zi&#8208;Yi Du, Weizhao Cai, Rui&#8208;Kang Huang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202500027). This material features dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive phase transitions: a thermally activated ferroelectric transition via spiro&#8208;conformational flipping and a pressure&#8208;induced transition arising from helical chain deformation. This study showcases a rare example of a multi&#8208;responsive neutral ferroelectric system, advancing the design of molecular ferroelectrics via unconventional stimulus&#8211;response mechanisms.

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

         <title>Combining Two Mechanistically Distinct Reactions from a Single Iron Complex: A Tandem Approach to Thermally Stable and Recyclable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. The study emphasizes the potential for chemical recycling, making these materials environmentally friendly and suitable for various applications.








Abstract
A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;An iron-based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring-opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one-pot iron-based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring-opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Ethylene&#8211;Acrylate Copolymers Synthesized with Highly Active Neutral Nickel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers are directly synthesized with outstanding catalytic activities using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component nickel catalyst, which maintain the essential bulk properties of UHMWPE, reach an impressive tensile strength of 44&#160;MPa, and possess improved surface and dyeing properties.








Abstract
Molecular weight is a crucial parameter in catalytic olefin polymerization to determine the thermomechanical properties of polymers. Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component phosphine&#8208;phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n&#8208;butyl acrylate, and t&#8208;butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1000 to 2700&#160;kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A relatively large&#8208;scale synthesis (30&#8211;50&#160;g) of UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. In particular, the tensile strength of the ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44&#160;MPa (147&#160;MPa after a predrawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Driven Cooperative Photocatalytic Coupling of Biomass Valorization and Hydrogen Peroxide Production Using Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel singlet oxygen&#8208;promote photocatalysis on COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 couples biomass valorization with H2O2 production, diverging from traditional H2O2 photocatalysis, which relies on photoexcited electrons and holes. Herein, singlet oxygen consumes most electron&#8211;hole pairs, facilitating an Achmatowicz rearrangement with furfuryl alcohol. This yields high&#8208;value pyranones and H2O2, surpassing traditional products by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in market value.








Abstract
Traditional H2O2 photocatalysis primarily depends on photoexcited electrons and holes to drive oxygen reduction and water oxidation, respectively. However, singlet oxygen (1O2), often underappreciated, plays a pivotal role in H2O2 production. Meanwhile, photocatalytic biomass conversion has attracted attention, yet studies combining H2O2 synthesis with biomass valorization remain rare and typically yield low&#8208;value products. Herein, a strategy of photocatalytic valorization of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) coupled with the efficient co&#8208;production of H2O2 is reported, enabled by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) induced, 1O2&#8208;participated Achmatowicz rearrangement. This study introduces polyimide&#8208;based COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 with tailored nitrogen content, representing an unprecedently efficient platform for 1O2 production. Remarkably, reducing the nitrogen content of the COF enhances 1O2 production, significantly boosting the H2O2 generation rate. In FFA, the primary pathway for H2O2 production is Achmatowicz rearrangement, achieving a rate ten times higher than that reliant on oxygen reduction reaction in pure water, reaching 4549 &#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. Mechanism studies revealed 1O2 selectively engaged FFA, bypassing hole oxidation to trigger the Achmatowicz rearrangement, producing valuable 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;(2H)&#8208;pyranone with 99% conversion and 92% selectivity. This work establishes a coupling strategy for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and biochemicals, offering a transformative approach to sustainable photocatalysis.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a covalent PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) was developed to achieve precise and efficient degradation of ZBP1 by leveraging DNA aptamer targeting and NASA&#8208;mediated covalent binding. This approach suppresses necroptosis and mitigates inflammation, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for infection&#8208;induced inflammation and diseases. The findings highlight the potential of targeted protein degradation in modulating inflammatory responses and advancing treatment options.








Abstract
Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lacking so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Elucidating Relay Catalysis on Copper Clusters With Satellite Single Atoms for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the relay catalysis for urea electrosynthesis on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC, &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites convert NO3&#8722; to *NOx, and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites promote water dissociation, yielding *H for *NOx hydrogenation. The resultant *NH2 then couples with *CO2 activated by &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites, facilitating an efficient cascade catalysis for urea production. This process highlights the synergy between &#8220;CuAC&#8221; and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites in enhancing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (CuAC) with satellite Cu&#9472;N4 single atoms (CuSA) sites on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The designed CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC catalyst exhibits an approximately threefold higher urea yield rate compared to that of CuSA@NC at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V versus RHE. Ex&#8208;situ experimental results and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis reveal a formation sequence between the *NH2 and *NH2CO species on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC with increasing reduction potential. The combination of theoretical calculations further elucidates that the relay catalysis pathway involves &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites facilitating the conversion of *NO3 to *NOx, followed by a hydrogenation process to form *NH2 with *H from water dissociation promoted by &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites, which subsequently couples with *CO2 to produce urea.

&lt;p&gt;In the relay catalysis for urea electrosynthesis on Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NC, &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites convert NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to *NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites promote water dissociation, yielding *H for *NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. The resultant *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then couples with *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activated by &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites, facilitating an efficient cascade catalysis for urea production. This process highlights the synergy between &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; and &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites in enhancing catalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;) with satellite Cu&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single atoms (Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;) sites on the nitrogen-doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co-reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The designed Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NC catalyst exhibits an approximately threefold higher urea yield rate compared to that of Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NC at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V versus RHE. &lt;i&gt;Ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; experimental results and in-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis reveal a formation sequence between the *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO species on Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NC with increasing reduction potential. The combination of theoretical calculations further elucidates that the relay catalysis pathway involves &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites facilitating the conversion of *NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to *NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by a hydrogenation process to form *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with *H from water dissociation promoted by &#8220;Cu&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; sites, which subsequently couples with *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce urea. This work provides novel insights into the investigation of coupling reactions, but not limit to, urea synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemically Enabled Formal Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Between Aryl Ethers and Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents are essential in modern synthetic chemistry. This study investigates a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aryl ethers and aryl fluorides. The method is characterized by mild conditions, short reaction times, and the production of a range of aryl coupling compounds with high yields. Mechanistic studies show that nickel is involved in the activation of both C&#9472;O and C&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents have become increasingly important in modern synthetic chemistry. Previous studies have investigated electrophilic reagents featuring zero or one inactive bond; however, reactions involving electrophilic reagents with two inactive bonds remain unexplored. This study presents the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction under mechanical conditions, involving aryl ethers and aryl fluorides, both of which contain inactive bonds. The reaction successfully synthesized a series of multifunctional biphenyl compounds, specifically including several sparingly soluble substrates that are challenging to prepare in a solvent system. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that nickel and magnesium play a crucial role in the activation of C&#9472;F bonds. This novel coupling reaction offers a beneficial approach for polymer degradation and the development of luminescent materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization Under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization significantly enhances the reactivity of acidic CTAs with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts, enabling polymerization under low light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). This approach outperforms traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently. Mechanistic studies suggest base addition shifts activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.








Abstract
Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), limiting energy efficiency, and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy is presented to achieve upcycling of polycaprolactone (PCL) to adipic acid (AA) using Pt/TiO2 as a catalyst in water with [BMIm][NTf2] via hydrolysis of PCL and subsequent oxidation, achieving complete conversion of PCL with an AA yield of 85.60%.








Abstract
Upgrading polyester waste into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA) and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2&#8208;supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140&#160;&#176;C, 1.5&#160;MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8211; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water are involved in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity toward AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL and also to access AA.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#9472;H Bond Functionalization of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontypical sugars represent a prominent, yet hardly, accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. Here, we disclose a technology toward non&#8208;typical sugars that allows facile, and site&#8208;selective functionalization of native sugars. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant carbohydrates.








Abstract
Non&#8208;typical C&#8208;functionalized sugars represent a prominent yet hardly accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. The available synthetic methodologies toward such sugar derivatives suffer either from an extensive use of protecting groups, requiring long and laborious synthetic manipulations, or from limited predictability and noncontrollable site&#8208;selectivity of the employed C&#8208;functionalization reactions. In this work, we disclose an alternative synthetic methodology toward nontypical sugars that allows facile, site&#8208;selective, and stereocontrolled C&#8208;functionalization of sugars through a traceless tethering approach. The described silyl&#8208;based redox&#8208;active tethering group appends directly to the unprotected sugar substrate and mediates the C&#8208;functionalization reaction through a photochemically&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, while transforming into a readily&#8208;removable silyl protecting group. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrate substrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant C&#8208;functionalized carbohydrate conjugates.

         <title>Identifying Key Properties That Drive Redox Mediator Activity in Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of structurally diverse quinones led to defining key physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions that drive type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2)&#8208;dependent extracellular electron transfer activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Analysis of lead quinones in bioelectrochemical systems revealed that the amine&#8208;containing compounds can produce stable current profiles for up to 5 days.








Abstract
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.

         <title>Homologation of Alkenes Using Acetylene as a C2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the homologation of alkenes that employs acetylene as a C&#8322; feedstock and proceeds via an alkyl borane intermediate has been developed. Commercially available but expensive and unavailable alkenes can be synthesized by this methodology from their C&#8322; shorter homologues, which can be much less expensive. A variety of functional groups and a series of alkene substitution patterns were tolerated, and a chain length increase of up to twelve carbon atoms was achieved by iterative homologation.








Abstract
The preparation of diverse homologs from lead compounds has been a common and important practice in medicinal, mechano, polymeric, and many other branches of chemistry. The homologation of alkenes, though important, remains challenging due to the difficulty of (CH2)n insertion into the main carbon chain of alkenes compared to chains containing other polar functional groups. Here, we report the homologation of both terminal and internal alkenes by using acetylene as a cheap and abundant C2 feedstock. The process involves an in&#8208;situ transformation of alkenes into boranes and then into elongated alkenes, during which direct (CH2)n insertion is avoided. The reaction can be carried out iteratively to achieve up to a 12&#8208;carbon elongation.

         <title>Isoselenourea&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self&#8208;Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridone and &#8208;pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2&#8208;addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.








Abstract
Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridones and &#8208;pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er) via an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;cyclization process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self&#8208;correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]&#8208;addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol. The scope and limitations of this process are developed across a range of examples, with insight into the factors leading to the observed enantioselectivity provided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis.

         <title>Cleavable Strand&#8208;Fusing Cross&#8208;Linkers as Additives for Chemically Deconstructable Thermosets with Preserved Thermomechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cleavable &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs) as additives for polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets. During polymerization, SFCs fuse two network strands at four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;links and thereby achieve network dissolution at very low loadings without compromising thermomechanical properties. SFCs perform similarly under oven curing and frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions.








Abstract
Permanently cross&#8208;linked polymer networks&#8212;thermosets&#8212;are often difficult to chemically deconstruct. The installation of cleavable bonds into the strands of thermosets using cleavable comonomers as additives can facilitate thermoset deconstruction without replacement of permanent cross&#8208;links, but such monomers can lead to reduced thermomechanical properties and require high loadings to function effectively, motivating the design of new and optimal cleavable additives. Here, we introduce &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs), which fuse two network strands via a four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;link. SFCs enable deconstruction of model polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets with as little as one&#8208;fifth of the molar loading needed to achieve deconstruction using traditional cleavable comonomers. SFCs function under traditional oven curing as well as low&#8208;energy frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions and lead to improved thermomechanical properties, for example, glass transition temperatures, compared to prior cleavable comonomer designs. This work motivates the development of increasingly improved cleavable additives to enable thermoset deconstruction without compromising material performance.

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO2 reduction via contact&#8208;electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet&#8208;induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO2 adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion to methanol.








Abstract
Metal catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability, and environmental impact. Although various structurally diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and nonrecyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable nonmetallic polymer material (vitrimer) as a catalyst for a new platform in contact&#8208;electrocatalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2 adsorption and enriching friction&#8208;generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2 to promote CO2RR. After 84&#160;h of CO2RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact&#8208;electroreduction strategy for CO2 offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet&#8208;based contact&#8208;electrochemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction via contact-electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet-induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &amp;gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to methanol.

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent and selective ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone is reported. HDX&#8208;MS reveals that LIBX&#8208;A401 stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus and alters the fatty acid (FA) gate domain. Consistently, photoaffinity labeling, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis identify key binding residues within the FA pocket. LIBX&#8208;A401 also exhibits ACSL4&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supporting its therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. However, its reference inhibitor, rosiglitazone, has off&#8208;target activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid homeostasis. Here, the discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone devoid of PPAR&#947; activity, is reported. Its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent, stabilizing the C&#8208;terminal domain and altering the fatty acid gate region, as shown by Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. Photoaffinity labeling identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by target engagement. These findings establish LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool to study ACSL4 in ferroptosis and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way for the rational design of improved inhibitors.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Formamide via an Oxidant&#8208;Free Photoinduced Radical Coupling Route over Pt&#8208;CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia was successfully achieved through an oxidant&#8208;free radical coupling route on Pt&#8208;loaded CdS, with considerable value&#8208;added hydrogen production. A series of in situ characterizations revealed that the efficient C&#9472;N coupling between &#183;CH2OH and &#183;NH2 driven by photoinduced holes achieved the synthesis of formamide and hydrogen without formaldehyde, which makes the artificial photocatalytic route more competitive.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale manufacturing of formamide is always involved with the use of carbon monoxide, hence developing a series of eco&#8208;friendly synthesis routes is of great significance. Alternative feedstock of low&#8208;cost methanol is expected to fulfill this breakthrough due to its green and renewable nature; however, the overoxidation of methanol severely inhibits the efficacious formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia through the conventional catalytic route. Herein, we report the successful development of a direct radical coupling route for converting methanol and ammonia into high&#8208;selectivity formamide and hydrogen without extra oxidants under ambient conditions. The optimized Pt&#8208;CdS photocatalysts offered an impressive formamide production rate of 1.45&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, as well as an exceptional hole selectivity reaching up to 63.5%. The oxidant&#8208;free radical mechanism of high&#8208;efficiency formamide generation as revealed by in situ characterizations (e.g., in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy), stems from the photogenerated holes oxidizing the methanol to hydroxymethyl radical for subsequently direct C&#9472;N coupling with amino radical. This work demonstrates an efficient oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced radical coupling strategy with the promise of an acceptable alternative to current technologies for artificial photosynthesis formamide using clean and abundant solar energy.

         <title>Isomeric 1,4&#8208;Dihydropentalene&#8208;Containing Building Blocks for High Mobility Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

We report the synthesis of two novel isomeric derivatives of 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indeneo (DHI), incorporating a thieno group to reduce torsional disorder. The anti&#8208;C16DHIT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT isomers differ in conjugation characteristics, with the anti&#8208;isomer showing fully delocalized conjugation, whereas syn isomer exhibiting cross&#8208;conjugation. The polymer based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT exhibits high hole mobility of 2.38 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of pIDTBT in same device structure.








Abstract
Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, though lacking long&#8208;range order, can exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4&#8208;dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti&#8208;isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross&#8208;conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT. Devices based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selectively Accelerating the Generation of &#946;&#8208;Linked Residue Isoaspartate in Proteins</title>

Isoaspartate (isoAsp), a &#946;&#8208;linked residue, widely exists in proteins. A method that allows the site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins has been developed. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative that undergoes a facile intramolecular reaction to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to the major product isoAsp.








Abstract
Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a &#946;&#8208;linked residue in proteins spontaneously generated through Asn deamidation or Asp dehydration and significantly affects protein properties. However, the sluggish and site&#8208;nonselective generation of isoAsp residues in proteins severely impedes in&#8208;depth biological investigations as well as the exploitation of its unique &#946;&#8208;linkage features. Herein, we introduce a method that allows site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative (BnD), which undergoes facile intramolecular arrangement to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to isoAsp as the major product. On native sites of proteins, including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrate that BnD&#8208;mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.

         <title>Polychromatic Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single Heteroligand Metal&#8211;Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of heteroligand MOFs composting of porphyrin and pyrene ligands as crystalline emitters for polychromatic ECL imaging. Due to rational conjugated spacing of MOF, it exhibits excellent energy transfer efficiency and unique polychromatic ECL imaging characteristics, providing the first instance of single MOF crystals in ECL imaging.








Abstract
Conventional polychromatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging is realized with the several separated luminophores at the different potentials. In this study, an emerging polychromatic ECL imaging system was constructed based on single heteroligand metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals as nanoemitters through an intrareticular energy transfer process. The heteroligand MOF crystals, named h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241, were coassembled of meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) ligand using benzoic acid catalyst with coordination ability, leading to the conjugated spacing of 0.624&#160;nm between two ligands. Remarkably, an energy transfer efficiency of 92.2% was achieved when the coordination weight ratio of TCPP acceptor and TBAPy donor was only 1.87&#8240;. Different from monoligand MOFs, the heteroligand h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241 exhibits dual ECL emissions in both blue and red regions at one step applied potential, which is first example of polychromatic ECL imaging for single MOF crystals. Furthermore, by adjusting the reaction conditions, the morphology distribution of porphyrin within the crystal can be dynamically controlled, providing a tailored crystal platform for decoding fundamentals in polychromatic ECL imaging.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimizes the Al anode/electrolyte interface by incorporating anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) to achieve stable Al anode. The alkyl chains preferentially adsorb on Al surface, forming dense adsorption layer that mitigates corrosion from the electrolyte. Additionally, &#9472;SO3 and phenyl rings provide electrostatic shielding layer with moderately electronegative that regulates ion migration. The uniform ion flow effect facilitates the uniform nucleation and deposition of Al, suppressing dendritic growth and tip effects, thereby enhancing the cycling stability and lifespan of the rechargeable aluminum battery.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address the aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS&#8208;modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.

         <title>Spontaneous Anionic Double Capture/Displacement to Trigger Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Interpenetrating Polymer Networks with Desired Ionic Conductivity for Durable Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.








Abstract
The engineering of single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single&#8208;ion conductive solid or quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single&#8208;ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase&#8208;functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1). The single&#8208;ion&#8208;conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn2+ stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled NH4V4O10//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance SICs.

         <title>Electrochemical Amino&#8208;Oxygenation Cyclization via Alkene Radical Cation/Bisnucleophile Engagement to Saturated N/O&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkene radical cations with bisnucleophiles enabled the formation of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles. In situ EC&#8208;MS data offered valuable insights into the radical cation&#8208;initiated difunctionalization, allowing precise control over regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Because of their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

     alt="Electrochemical Amino-Oxygenation Cyclization via Alkene Radical Cation/Bisnucleophile Engagement to Saturated N/O-Heterocycles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical amino-oxygenation of alkene radical cations with bisnucleophiles enabled the formation of saturated &lt;i&gt;N/O&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles. In situ EC-MS data offered valuable insights into the radical cation-initiated difunctionalization, allowing precise control over regio- and chemoselectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Because of their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino-oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio- and chemoselectivity. Our approach offers a direct route to six-, seven-, and eight-membered &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles from simple starting materials, broadening access to complex molecules essential for medicinal chemistry and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid, Precise, and Robust Supramolecular Polymerization from Functional Oligomeric&#8208;Charged Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) amphiphiles enables their crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with unprecedented rapid growth kinetics and precise size control. This robust supramolecular polymerization allows access to hierarchical hairy structures with dense, uniform micellar brushes via a &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; approach initiated from the surface of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.








Abstract
Nature inspires the design of artificial systems with remarkable rapidity, precision, and functionality, yet achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a challenge. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) methods have enabled the formation of low&#8208;dispersity block copolymer nanofibers with crystalline cores, but these processes typically involve moderate or slow growth kinetics to ensure well&#8208;controlled and ordered epitaxial crystallization. Here, we report studies on the living CDSA of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) amphiphiles, demonstrating an unprecedented combination of rapidity and precision. We show that self&#8208;seeding can produce nanofibers with controllable lengths up to &#8764;700&#160;nm within &#8764;15&#160;min (including 5&#160;min of disassembly and 10&#160;min of re&#8208;growth), while seeded growth can generate nanofibers up to &gt; 2000&#160;nm in length within &#8764;20&#8211;40&#160;min, depending on the unimer&#8208;to&#8208;seed mass ratios. Notably, this robust supramolecular polymerization can be initiated from the surfaces of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets, resulting in hierarchical hairy structures grafted with dense, uniform micellar brushes.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable H2S releasing motif was developed, enabling the encapsulation of payloads featuring diverse functional sites. The delivery of H2S was achieved through a COS mediate pathway characterized by an adjustable releasing profile. Additionally, drugs possessing function sites could be readily integrated into this platform, thereby facilitating the construction of prodrugs.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tool for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agent.

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synthesized a series of novel nanostructures with polyoxometalates (POMs) inserted into vanadate&#8208;based compounds via a solvothermal method to achieve uniform dispersion of POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds. The electronic synergistic effect between the POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds effectively reduced the Zn2&#8314; migration barrier and accelerated Zn2&#8314; migration on the cathode, resulting in a high specific capacity. This work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel 3D nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33&#160;&#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

An ionic liquid&#8208;driven compacting strategy was proposed to form FSI&#8722;&#8208;rich solvation structures with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and low&#8208;desolvation energy at a low concentration of 0.8 M, which enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics by promoting the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and accelerated K+ transport kinetics, enabling the PB||CSE||graphite full cell to operate for 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 88%.








Abstract
The development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) faces significant challenges due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to achieve satisfactory energy density and long&#8208;term stability. This work reports an innovative compact&#8208;solvation electrolyte (CSE) strategy leveraging ionic liquid&#8208;induced manipulation of solvation structures under low concentration for high&#8208;performance PIBs. The CSE, formulated with a low&#8208;salt concentration of 0.8&#160;M, simultaneously exhibits compact solvation structures with abundant F&#8208;rich anions, high&#8208;ionic conductivity, and low&#8208;desolvation energy. These features lead to enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics through the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as accelerated K+ transport kinetics. Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high&#8208;reversible capacity of 252&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the Prussian blue||graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.

Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high-reversible capacity of 252&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the Prussian blue||graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The illustration of the intricate oxygen evolution mechanism of antifluorite Li5FeO4 (LFO) prelithiation agent, which is originally explained in a variety of novel and unconventional perspectives: lattice mismatch induced by the coexistence of Fe&#8208;O tetrahedral (tet.) and octahedral (oct.) activate the lattice oxygen, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O&#8722; configurations dimerize to superoxide and O2, the nucleophilic reaction between superoxide and electrolyte contributes to cathode electrolyte interface (CEI), the oxidized O species shuttle to the anode side participating in the construction of solid electrolyte interface (SEI).








Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh g&#8722;1) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt;4.0&#160;V vs. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#9472;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8722; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.

         <title>Electronegative Strategic Positions in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Unlocking High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs with an electronegative skeleton designed for selective gold recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers generate electron&#8208;rich sites at strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the framework. These features enable efficient gold capture, providing high&#8208;adsorption capacity and fast kinetics through electrostatic interactions, making the COFs highly effective for selective gold recovery.








Abstract
Gold (Au) concentrations accumulated from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and industrial leachates far surpass those found in natural ores, a highly valuable resource if efficient recovery methods can be developed. Despite advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), achieving adsorbents with high selectivity, large capacity, and rapid adsorption kinetics remain challenging because of limitations in partial pore wall sites. Here, we present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs (HATP&#8208;COFs) with an electronegative skeleton, specifically designed for selective Au recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers within the COFs introduce electron&#8208;rich sites that extend across strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the overall structural integrity. These features facilitate efficient Au capture through electrostatic interactions, achieving an exceptional adsorption capacity exceeding 2366&#160;mg g&#8722;1 with rapid kinetics, making HATP&#8208;COFs one of the most efficient pure COFs reported to date. Moreover, these HATP&#8208;COFs demonstrate remarkable selectivity, stability, and scalability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronegative skeleton introduces critical binding sites, promoting strong electrostatic interactions with Au3+ ions and improving adsorption kinetics. This work highlights the potential of charge&#8208;interface engineering in COFs as a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation materials.

         <title>A Promising Deep Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Activated by the Ordered Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

A promising deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#160;nonlinear optical crystal, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 with ordered design of the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups, has been successfully synthesized through utilizing the similar topological group substitution strategy. It exhibits excellent performance, i.e., the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation response among the KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like deep&#8208;ultraviolet borates, the best crystal growth habit along the c axis, short absorption edge, and sufficient birefringence.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals play a vitally important role in many scientific and technological fields, yet their rational design remains an ongoing challenge. Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV transparent NLO crystal Cs2KY(B3O6)2 has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we first use the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups to substitute the BO3 to maximize the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO6 connecting groups to replace two BeO3F groups to optimize the layer connections. Eventually, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along c axis (the strong layer&#8208;habit along c axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe2BO3F2 and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups and from (BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>Sustainability&#8208;Inspired Upcycling of Organophosphorus Pollutants into Phosphatic Fertilizer in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>

First report of organophosphorus pollutants selective degradation, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate and sodium percarbonate, into phosphates that are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on a continuous&#8208;flow reactor.








Abstract
With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates (o&#8208;PO43&#8722;), which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O2&#8722;, 1O2, and CO3&#183;&#8722;) for hydroxyethylidene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90&#160;min with the formation of 271.93&#160;&#181;mol/L of o&#8208;PO43&#8722;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.20% yield on continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous-flow reactor. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) for hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min.

         <title>Repurposing Post&#8208;Consumer Polyethylene to Access Cross&#8208;Linked Polyethylene with Reprocessability, Recyclability, and Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successfully repurposing mixed post&#8208;consumer PE into crosslinked PE (XLPE) with reprocessability, chemical recyclability, tunable properties, and potential degradability is achieved. The approach involves catalytically converting PE into telechelic oligomers with hydroxyl chain&#8208;end groups. Subsequent cross&#8208;linking the oligomers or their mixture with commercial macrodiols using hybrid cross&#8208;linkers provides XLPE with the modular properties.








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced plastic but accumulation and resistance to degradation has significantly contributed to the plastic waste crisis. Upcycling has presented promising solutions to transform PE waste into value&#8208;added products. In this study, mixed post&#8208;consumer PE was successfully repurposed into reprocessable and chemically recyclable cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). This process involved converting PE into telechelic oligomers, followed by repolymerization using a hybrid cross&#8208;linking system consisting of a dynamic cross&#8208;linker 2,4,6&#8208;triethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TETA) and non&#8208;dynamic cross&#8208;linker tris(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)isocyanurate (Tri&#8208;HDI). In the resulting XLPE, TETA facilitated iterative reprocessing with minimal property degradation across cycles, whereas Tri&#8208;HDI helped preserve functional performance throughout service life. Compared to PE, XLPE exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, reduced creep deformation under application&#8208;relevant temperatures, and high temperature structural stability. Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.

         <title>Unusual 1,1&#8208;Dicarboxylation Selectivity in the Domino Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with Formate and Application in Polyimide Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes using cesium formate and water was disclosed for the first time. The dicarboxylation reaction undergoes via &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to an acrylic acid intermediate. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids, succinic acids, and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. It may provide a new working mode for positive&#8208;type photoresists for photolithographic processing.








Abstract
We report for the first time a photoinduced domino 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives using a cesium formate solution (80% w/w in water), which is different from previous 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylation methods that usually produce succinic acids. Cesium malonate precipitated directly from the diluted reaction mixture and was collected by filtration without further purification. Interestingly, solid cesium formate with additional water led to a mono&#8208;carboxylation product. The solubility of cesium formate and alkaline environment are two key factors contributing to the outcome. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. Mechanism experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the malonic acid is formed through the &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to a cinnamate intermediate. This method enables direct preparation of water&#8208;soluble carboxylate&#8208;functionalized molecules and polymers from hydrophobic alkyne&#8208;containing precursors, showing potential usability in photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Mechanistic Control of Nonadiabatic Tunnelling in Triplet Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instanton theory is applied to study the reactivity of triplet carbenes at low temperature. We find a competition between a sequential mechanism of intersystem crossing (ISC) followed by hydrogen tunnelling and a new concerted nonadiabatic tunnelling pathway. This explains the differences in the observed reactivity of three chemically similar carbenes.








Abstract
Experiments on three chemically similar triplet carbenes observed the reaction of one at 10 K, another only when heated to 65 K, whereas the third remained stable despite heating. As the products are singlets, it is clear that the reactions involve intersystem crossing in addition to intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Here, instanton theory is used to study various possible reaction mechanisms, including sequential and concerted pathways. The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic&#160;tunnelling.

         <title>A Magnetic Field&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics by Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A magnetic field&#8208;assisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) battery was established by the spin&#8208;polarization strategy. The spin&#8208;polarized catalysts are capable of promoting electron transfer and improv ing the carrier separation efficiency, contributing to the accelerated kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for Li&#8211;O2 battery. With the magnetic field, the Li&#8211;O2 battery exhibited a low overpotential of 0.40 V, an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and a high energy efficiency of 96.3% under illumination. 








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force, and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives the charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. The&#160;Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40&#160;V was obtained for Li&#8211;O2 batteries with Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3 cathodes, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential of 0.12&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8211;O2 battery system provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8211;O2 battery.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force, and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field-assisted Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Mn&#8211;CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite, a magnetic field-responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions drives the charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. The&#160;Increased spin-polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40&#160;V was obtained for Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with Mn&#8211;CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential of 0.12&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery system provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Short&#8208;Path Hydrogen Spillover on CeO2&#8208;Supported PtPd Nanoclusters for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtPd alloy clusters anchored on CeO2 enable efficient hydrogen spillover via short&#8208;path interfacial transfer, achieving near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy (0.023 eV) for hydrogen adsorption. This design minimizes the HER energy barrier, yielding an ultralow overpotential of 5.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and robust stability in acidic media, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in supported metal electrocatalysts has garnered significant research attention for its potential to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency. However, challenges remain in facilitating hydrogen spillover and reducing the associated energy barriers. Herein, PtPd alloy clusters are anchored to the CeO2 surface, enabling short&#8208;path hydrogen spillover and lowering the reaction energy barrier in acidic environments. During HER, hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the noble metal surface and subsequently migrates to the interface, rather than precipitating directly on the CeO2 surface. This interface exhibits a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (0.023&#160;eV). Consequently, the catalyst demonstrates an exceptionally low overpotential of only 5.7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic media, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability. These findings provide valuable insights into designing highly efficient HER electrocatalysts for acidic environments based on hydrogen spillover mechanisms.

What are the tasks of chemical process development in the pharmaceutical industry? What are trends and challenges? This Scientific Perspective written by members of the European pharmaceutical industry introduces key concepts of drug development and key drivers for the future of chemical process development.








Abstract
Chemical process development is a critical component in the development process for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). With interfaces to drug discovery and API manufacturing, chemical process development activities must deliver scalable, safe, cost&#8208;efficient, sustainable, and reliable processes for novel as well as marketed APIs. Despite its importance for the pharmaceutical industry and society, the domain of chemical process development, together with its advances and challenges, is often not well known to nonpractitioners. As industry scientists, we provide a scientific perspective on the state of affairs in chemical process development, which we believe will be of value to a broader audience, including academic researchers, students, and professionals from related fields.

         <title>Photoexcited Structural Diversification of Carboxylic Acids with Phosphorus Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article showcases recent breakthroughs by Scheidt and co&#8208;workers in the photoexcited structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids. By leveraging hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and cyclization sequences, the generated diradicals facilitate the synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl and amino phosphonates in a highly efficient and sustainable manner.








Abstract
Photoexcitation of carboxylic acids is challenging due to high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. Recently, Scheidt and co&#8208;workers reported a single&#8208;flask transformation of carboxylic acids into acyl phosphonates, which facilitates the generation of diradicals under visible light irradiation. Building on this work, an efficient strategy for the structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids has been developed.

The slow dissociation of H&#8322;O, which serves as the rate&#8208;determining step, governs the overall performance of CO&#8322; reduction. Three key regulatory mechanisms are identified as: 1) The proton&#8208;feeding effect; 2) the positive charge depletion effect; and 3) the significant reverse reaction effect. These principles universally influence catalytic systems that involve H&#8322;O activation, providing a framework for atomic&#8208;scale design strategies for energy conversion interfaces in photo/electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction with H2O to produce fuels and chemicals offers a dual solution to address both environmental and energy challenges. For a long time, catalyst design in this reaction system has primarily focused on optimizing reduction sites to improve the efficiency or guide the reaction pathway of the CO2 reduction half&#8208;reaction. However, less attention has been paid to designing activation sites for H2O to modulate the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction. Impressively, the rate&#8208;determining step in overall CO2 reduction is the latter, and it influences the evolution direction and formation energy of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Herein, we summarize the mechanism of the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction in modulating CO2 reduction performance based on cutting&#8208;edge research. These analyses aim to uncover the potential regulatory mechanisms by which H2O activation influences CO2 reduction pathways and conversion efficiency, and to establish a mechanism&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationship that can guide the design and development of high&#8208;efficiency catalytic materials. A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H2O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Isotope Techniques in Chemical Wastewater Treatment: Opportunities and Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we would first introduce basic knowledge about isotopic compounds and then scrutinize the physical and chemical influence induced by isotope changes. Special attention will be paid to the uncertainties in explaining the isotope results. Next, the implications in kinetic isotope effects (KIE, including solvent and nonsolvent KIE) and element tracing will be individually discussed. Notably, the combination of isotope techniques with EPR, infrared, Raman, and DFT calculation will be summarized. Finally, the limitations and outlooks will be proposed.








Abstract
A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis of reaction mechanisms is essential for advancing chemical water treatment technologies. However, due to the limitations of conventional experimental and analytical methods, the types of reactive species and their generation pathways are commonly debatable in many aqueous systems. As highly sensitive diagnostic tools, isotope techniques offer deeper insights with minimal interference from reaction conditions. Nevertheless, precise interpretations of isotope results remain a significant challenge. Herein, we first scrutinized the fundamentals of isotope chemistry and highlighted key changes induced by the isotope substitution. Next, we discussed the application of isotope techniques in kinetic isotope effects, presenting a roadmap for interpreting KIE in sophisticated systems. Furthermore, we summarized the applications of isotope techniques in elemental tracing to pinpoint reaction sites and identify dominant reactive species. Lastly, we propose future research directions, highlighting critical considerations for the rational design and interpretation of isotope experiments in environmental chemistry and related fields.

         <title>Unlocking the ConPeT Mechanism: Correspondence on &#8220;Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3&#160;+&#160;2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer&#8221;</title>

Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy highlights that the excited state of the radical anion of 4DPAPN, a TADF chromophore employed as a photocatalyst, is not directly involved in a ConPeT mechanism. Instead, its high reducing ability stems from the generation of solvated electrons through a two&#8208;photon process in acetonitrile solution.








Abstract
Recently, in a communication to this journal, Qiao, Jang, and coworkers described an asymmetric photoredox reaction promoted by TADF cyanoarene photocatalysts (specifically 4DPAPN (3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)phthalonitrile)). The authors claimed that the high reduction potential required for the reaction in acetonitrile was achieved by the radical anion of the photocatalyst in its excited state, which initiated the reaction. This mechanism is usually named consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPeT), in which two photons are involved: the first one to excite the photocatalyst and generate the radical anion 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; and the second photon to promote 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; to its excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211;. Employing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, here we report that, although two photons are indeed involved in this transformation, the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; is short&#8208;lived, not emissive, and not quenched by the organic substrate employed in the reaction, opposite to what was claimed by the authors. The photocatalyst in the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; can generate a solvated electron that is able to reduce the substrate involved in this chemistry. It is worth noting that a different photochemical mechanism is likely to be operative in CH2Cl2, where solvated electrons are much less stabilized and reduction of the solvent might occur.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone&#8208; and Bacteria&#8208;Specific Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate at the single&#8208;cell level the reversible primary attachment between plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant roots. Bacterial affinities are both species&#8208; and region&#8208;specific along the root, with flagella playing a key role in mediating these interactions. The physicochemical properties of the root surface and the bacterial envelope significantly influence how these PGPR attach.








Abstract
Understanding root&#8211;bacteria interactions with plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single&#8208;cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, Bacillus velezensis and Pseudomonas defensor, to different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer&#8208;long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of flagella in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8211;bacteria interactions. We also examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in the physicochemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single&#8208;cell analysis. Overall, our results provide a nanoscale view of bacterial attachment to roots, offering key insights into how beneficial bacteria colonize roots, crucial for enhancing biofertilizer effectiveness.

         <title>Rational Screening of Siloxane Molecules as Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol is proposed for screening potential electrolyte additives from a number of siloxane molecules for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, greatly improves the high&#8208;temperature performance due to its preferential binding with anions, high reactivity with H2O/HF, and good interface stabilization.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is, therefore, essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high&#8208;temperature performance of the anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, prefers to interact with anions due to the unique electron&#8208;donating of Si&#8594;CH3. This association then weakens the P&#9472;F bond and facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6&#8722;, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C after 750 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high&#8208;temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. The results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Acylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Enabled by a Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis was disclosed, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in high efficiency, with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations support the radical pathway and rationalize the radical coupling via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step.








Abstract
Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by the initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promotes the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions and is free of transition&#8208;metals (TMs) and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient recycling strategy is developed, where a commercially available boron catalyst is used to selectively break C(sp3)&#9472;O bond in epoxy resins to recover bisphenol A, and the other part of epoxy resin is recovered as epoxy monomers by the reconstruction of C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and hydroxyl cyclization, realizing the high&#8208;value and full recovery of epoxy resins.








Abstract
Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a full recovery strategy for the conversion of EPs into high&#8208;value platform compounds, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA) and epoxy monomers such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80), which involves the selective breaking of the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond using commercially available boron trichloride (BCl3), the reconstruction of the broken C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and the cyclization of the hydroxy groups. The yield of BPA is 93 wt% with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100% recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Because of its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and by&#8208;products, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics Toward High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) is designed to construct &#9472;CN&#9472;TM complexation and lithiophilic/electron&#8208;blocking interlayer for high voltage lithium metal batteries. The stable &#9472;CN&#8208;enriched CEI weakens the catalytic reaction of TM ions into the electrolyte. A hybrid SEI composed of Li&#8211;Sn alloy and LiF achieves dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the battery shows excellent cycle performance.








Abstract
The chemical properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability&#160;of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8211;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 55&#160;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activated Formation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>

High&#8208;intensity NIR radiation around 800&#160;nm enables the manufacture of dry film resists (DFRs) using a combination of hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazole (HABI) and N&#8208;phenyl imino acetic acid. The mechanism is based on activated electron transfer processes supported by the respective product analysis.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#183;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylates when different hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated as coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HABI derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) served as the monomers. Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficiently for radical photopolymerization than a Sens without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of PET can give an explanation for these differences. The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1 to S0 additionally influenced the endothermic reaction between L&#183; and NPG. These systems worked in practical applications for dry film photoresists (DFRs), reported here for the first time.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as a Primer in a Dual&#8208;Layer Coating for Corrosion Protection on Iron</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) monolayer is electrodeposited on Fe foil and effectively functioned as a binder for a secondary layer of a cross&#8208;linked polymer network, which is photo&#8208;polymerized on the NHC monolayer. The dual coating, constructed of NHC monolayer and polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation on Fe.








Abstract
The development of highly stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, it is demonstrated that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual&#8208;layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.

         <title>Artificial Carbon Neutrality Through Aprotic CO2 Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reducing hydrogen&#8208;mediated natural photosynthesis, in which CO&#8322; is converted into O&#8322; and glucose, a lithium&#8208;mediated aprotic electrochemical strategy for splitting CO&#8322; into O&#8322; and carbon taking advantage of the stronger reducibility of lithium over hydrogen is developed. Within the designed electrochemical device, CO2 is reduced sequentially into Li&#8322;CO&#8323; and Li&#8322;O, followed by the oxidation of Li2O to release O2. Moreover, the high O2 yield of over 98% can be achieved with the assistance of appropriate catalysts, significantly advancing carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.








Abstract
Global climate change mitigation necessitates global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Natural photosynthesis exemplifies an ingenious approach to carbon neutrality, converting CO2 into O2 and glucose through light and dark reactions. Inspired by the hydrogen&#8208;involved processes in photosynthesis, an aprotic electrochemical strategy for CO2 splitting into O2 and carbon using lithium as a reducing mediator is presented. The designed electrochemical device features a gas cathode with a nanoscale Co catalyst and a metallic lithium anode. When CO2 is introduced to the cathode, it undergoes a two&#8208;step lithium&#8208;related electrochemical reduction, converting it sequentially into Li2CO3 and Li2O. Li2O is then oxidized to produce O2 gas at the expense of renewable electrical energy. This process achieves an impressive O2 yield exceeding 94.7%, significantly outperforming the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. Moreover, the O2 yield can be further increased to 98.6% by employing an optimized RuCo catalyst. This study offers a new practical and controllable pathway to produce O2 from CO2, strongly promoting the sustainable development of human society for realizing carbon neutrality as well as exploring and conquering nature.

         <title>A General and Mild Two&#8208;Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed&#8208;Loop CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and mild two&#8208;step synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize chemically recyclable polycarbonates for CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. This approach involves the synthesis of a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers from bio&#8208;derived diols and CO2, followed by organocatalytic living/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO2 and sustainable co&#8208;feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon&#8208;neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents were synthesized using CO2 and bioderived 1,3&#8208;alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (t&#8208;BuP2) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance). Notably, the &#945;&#8208;substituent in the monomers reduced the ring strains, allowing the resulting polycarbonates to be fully recycled to the monomers without decarboxylation. The recycling process effectively traps CO2 in a closed loop between monomers and polymers, preventing its release into the atmosphere. The alkyl side groups enhanced the hydrophobicity of the polycarbonates, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO2 release through hydrolysis during their lifecycle, achieving a robust CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. The utility of CO2&#8208;based aliphatic polycarbonates as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with l&#8208;lactide were explored.

Monomers and dimers are produced and linked by azobenzene. The impact of azobenzene photoswitching on the ion channel blocking potency of the peptide is evaluated and revealed that proper positioning leads to successful photomodulation.








Abstract
Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to natural peptides rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels is novel due to larger pharmacophores. A pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels is initiated. Two click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;compatible azobenzene are synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az1 &amp; Az2). Az1 is grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L&#8208;azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the cis configuration, Az1 altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage, while conversely, Az2 increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure&#8208;activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.

         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>

Two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, ClBTI and ClBTI2, were developed, and the n&#8208;type polymers built from them showed ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility. Ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells fabricated using them as the third component delivered power conversion efficiencies up to 19.35%, much higher than that (15.84%) of the binary one.








Abstract
Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show a near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6 and new polymers show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 1%. Interestingly, by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component into the host system PM6:PY&#8208;IT, continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer ternary blends, yielding a remarkable PCE of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%) through optimizing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. The structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, marking a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Metallomimetic Reactivity of a Transient Dicoordinate Alkylborylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Generation of the first metal&#8208;free dicoordinate alkylborylene, [(CAAC)BCy] (CAAC&#160;=&#160;cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl), is reported. This species exhibits metallomimetic reactivity with donor ligands and dihydrogen and is more reactive than amino counterparts. Metallomimetic chemistry of the carbonyl&#8208;ligated borylene [(CAAC)BCy(CO)] is also demonstrated. 








Abstract
While existing literature has primarily focused on carbene&#8208;stabilized amino&#8208; and arylborylenes of the form [(carbene)BR] (R&#160;=&#160;substituent), herein we report the generation and metallomimetic reactivity of the first carbene&#8208;stabilized alkylborylene [(CAACMe)BCy] (CAACMe&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl). Furthermore, the transition metal&#8208;like decarbonylation reactions of a borylene complex, [(CAACMe)BCy(CO)], derived from borylene [(CAACMe)BCy] and CO, are described. Additional findings described include i) the identification of the coordination stages of the ligand to boron towards forming complexes [(CAACMe)BCyL] in the reduction route from starting material [(CAACMe)BCyBr2] and in the photolysis route from carbonyl complex [(CAACMe)BCy(CO], and ii) insights from quantum&#8208;chemical computations regarding the molecular and electronic structure of the borylene at various stages.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Synthesis by Using Zero&#8208;Valent Metal Powder with Alcohols or Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered the first molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle zero&#8208;valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 








Abstract
We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.

         <title>Explainable Synthesizability Prediction of Inorganic Crystal Polymorphs Using Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized LLMs for structure&#8208;based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine&#8208;tuned LLMs and LLM&#8208;embedding&#8208;based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph&#8208;based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine&#8208;tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 








Abstract
We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.

&lt;p&gt;We utilized LLMs for structure-based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine-tuned LLMs and LLM-embedding-based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph-based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human-readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive-unlabeled learning model on a text-embedding representation of the structure. An LLM-based workflow can then be used to generate human-readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non-synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trap&#8208;Enabled Long Exciton Lifetime in Low&#8208;Toxicity Quantum Dots for Enhanced Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing surface traps onto the low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based quantum dots, the excitation energy circulates between exciton states and trap states, leading to trap&#8208;state&#8208;mediated thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. The applications of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction were achieved by leveraging the long excited&#8208;state lifetime of delayed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Prolonging exciton lifetime in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is crucial to their photochemical applications. Previously, this was achieved through a mechanism called thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) for QDs surface&#8208;anchored with molecular triplet energy acceptors, in which the molecular triplets sensitized by QDs can repopulate QD&#8208;excitons through thermally activated reverse energy transfer. Here, we demonstrate a novel TADPL mechanism achieved by engineering the surface trap states of QDs. Rapid exciton trapping and thermally activated slow detrapping prolong the exciton lifetime of low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based QDs from the timescale of &#8764;10&#160;ns to &#8764;100&#160;&#181;s. Such a long exciton lifetime allows direct engagement of QDs in diffusion&#8208;assisted energy transfer, without needing surface&#8208;anchored molecules as triplet transmitters, for solution&#8208;phase photochemical applications such as photon upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition. This advantage not only greatly streamlines the design of QD&#8208;based photochemical systems but also avoids the reliability issue associated with the anchoring between QDs and molecules, as well as enabling facile tuning of the TADPL wavelength range not limited by the availability of molecular triplet acceptors.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework With Rich Redox Active Sites as Cathode Material for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites has been designed and prepared. Experiments and calculations reveal that C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups are active sites during discharge/charge processes. The TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can store 27 Li+ ions in one ring and deliver a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile method to achieve high&#8208;capacity COF cathodes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for lithium batteries. However, they generally show low practical capacity. Here, the design, preparation, and battery application of a highly crystalline 2D truxenone&#8208;based COF (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites, realizing a high practical capacity is reported. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the lithiation reaction proceeds successively on C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF. One ring of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can theoretically store 27 Li+ ions through two stages. Consequently, the highly crystalline TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF displays a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1 when used as a cathode material for lithium batteries. This work provides a facile approach to achieve COF electrode materials with high practical capacity for lithium batteries.

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach employing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive enables the formation of highly ordered BTP&#8208;eC9 polymorphic crystals at low annealing temperatures. This enhances PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 active layer morphology, achieving a PCE of 20.32% with antireflection layers and exceptional device stability, advancing scalable strategies for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing, and introducing high boiling point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach of utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an antireflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of Mechanical Flexibility in Molecular Crystals: Dispersion Interactions Dictate Bending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of mechanical flexibility in molecular crystals based on anisotropy in interaction topology and their experimental validation reveals certain fundamental features of the origin of bending. Analyses based on interaction anisotropy indices and interaction components show that despite stronger electrostatic motifs, the bending in these crystals is still governed by dispersion forces. 








Abstract
Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interactions&#8212;a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography. Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high&#8208;pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile motif and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility. Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials to novel structural types aided by predictive computational models.

         <title>Compensating K Ions Through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

KSCN, with a low decomposition potential and high solubility in electrolytes, undergoes an oxidative reaction at 3.6&#160;V during the initial charging, releasing active K&#8208;ion and an electrolyte cosolvent (SCN)2. This electrolyte&#8208;based K&#8208;ion compensation approach is compatible with the entire battery system, allowing seamlessly integration into existing battery technologies.








Abstract
K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70%&#160;K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6&#160;V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Covalent Organic Framework Nanospheres for Stable Potassium Storage</title>

A template&#8208;free synthesis of MH&#8208;COFs is reported. Treating the designed crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneous covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with acetic acid solution produces hollow COFs. Subsequent expansion through seeded growth and acid treatment yields MH&#8208;COFs, whose applied implication is demonstrated by an MH&#8208;COFs/S composite as stable high&#8208;capacity K&#8208;ion battery anodes. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH&#8208;COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH&#8208;COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template&#8208;free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH&#8208;COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step&#8208;by&#8208;step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH&#8208;COFs. An extraordinarily stable K&#8208;ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH&#8208;COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH&#8208;COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications.

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate From Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet evaporation can lead to ion emission or droplet fission. In negatively charged droplets, charge can also be lost through electron emission. These ejected electrons can subsequently lead to ionization or electronic excitation in excess of 10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to the emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10&#160;eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high intrinsic electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation Interrogates the Native Structure of Integral Membrane Proteins</title>

IC&#8208;FPOMP (In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Membrane Proteins) enables rapid, free&#8208;radical footprinting upon laser irradiation of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in live cells by using TiO&#8322; nanoparticles or H2O2. IC&#8208;FP achieves broad coverage on a human glucose transporter and an enzyme (gamma glutamyl carboxylase), revealing conformational dynamics and interactions with drugs.








Abstract
Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, IC&#8208;FPOMP (in&#8208;cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC&#8208;FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO2 nanoparticles or H2O2) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96&#8208;well plate platform, high&#8208;throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC&#8208;FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter&#8208;hGLUT1 and human gamma&#8208;glutamyl carboxylase&#8208;hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In&#8208;cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug&#8208;binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC&#8208;FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure&#8208;function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.

This work demonstrates an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise electrostatic catalysis, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and reveal the crucial role of the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This study offers a unique route to discover novel phenomena and unveil the intrinsic mechanisms in the processes of material transformation and life activities.








Abstract
A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise control of oriented external electric fields, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and elucidate their roles in the reaction. Both temperature&#8208; and isotope&#8208;dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer and the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic fields and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 solvolysis on an in situ real-time single-molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise control of oriented external electric fields, we capture two short-lived protonated intermediates at the single-molecule level and elucidate their roles in the reaction. Both temperature- and isotope-dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen-bonded acetic-acid-mediated triple-proton-transfer and the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic fields and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size Effect of Surface Defects Dictates Reactivity for Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium&#8208;sized defects on VOx surfaces achieve an optimal synergy between electronic and geometric properties, enhancing N2 adsorption, activation, and hydrogenation while effectively suppressing HER. This results in remarkable eNRR activity and selectivity. A well&#8208;defined structure&#8211;activity relationship underscores the critical role of defect size in eNRR performance. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ammonia (NH3) production. Defect engineering enhances eNRR activity but can concurrently amplify the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), posing challenges for achieving high selectivity. Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes is engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium&#8208;sized defects (VOx&#8208;MD, 1&#8211;2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation. Consequently, VOx&#8208;MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94&#160;&#177; 1.45&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97&#160;&#177; 0.75&#160;% at &#8722;0.5 V (vs RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity, offering a scalable strategy for designing advanced catalysts for competitve electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>

         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation of acylates under Cu/Pd synergistic catalysis is reported. The incorporation of a silyl group into allyl acetates precisely controls regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric hindrance. Subsequent transformation of the silyl group in the product enables the regioselective synthesis of allylated products bearing two distinct yet structurally similar aryl groups.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44%&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88% to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride Toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin polarization of electrons is introduced to accelerate the exciton dissociation&#160;and the spin&#8208;selective electron transfer in CN/Fe nanohybrids to enhance selective CO2 photoreduction into CO, during which the oxidized Fe2+/Fe3+ pairs on the surface of Fe nanoparticles serve as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via double exchange interaction.








Abstract
The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2&#8314;/Fe3&#8314; redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe3&#8314;). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324; to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO&#8322;. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable porous crystal has demonstrated an unprecedented ability for inverse separation of C2H6/C2H4 at 328&#160;K, as the shifting degree of the H&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks, which determines the width of the narrow neck, can be finely regulated under the gas stimulus across a broad and elevated temperature range.








Abstract
Selective adsorption of ethane (C2H6) from mixtures containing ethylene (C2H4) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C2H4. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics in hydrogen&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H&#8208;bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C2H6 (37&#160;kPa) and C2H4 (53&#160;kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (15.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1) at 328&#160;K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor NTU&#8208;101, connected by three H&#8208;bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&#8722;1). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C2H4 purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.

In comparison, the framework response of the percussor &lt;b&gt;NTU-101&lt;/b&gt;, connected by three H-bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen-bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions Under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first example of a 1D spiro&#8208;based ferroelectric coordination polymer, which exhibits distinct phase transitions under thermal or pressure stimuli, triggered by the flipping of a spiro ring fragment as well as the deformation of the main chain.








Abstract
Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8315; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)&#8322;]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)&#8322;]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly for Bimodal In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, rationally designed self&#8208;assembled dyes are introduced&#8212;which offer controllable aggregate sizes and tunable NIR absorption and emission&#8212;as a unique and efficient platform for simultaneous multimodal [fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)] and multiscale (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) biomedical imaging.








Abstract
Contrast agents (CAs) are essential in biomedical imaging to aid in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of disease. However, they are typically restricted to one imaging modality and have fixed properties such as size, shape, toxicity profile, or photophysical characteristics, which hampers a comprehensive view of biological processes. Herein, rationally designed dye assemblies are introduced as a unique CA platform for simultaneous multimodal and multiscale biomedical imaging. To this end, a series of amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes are synthesized with varying hydrophobic domains (C1, C8, C12, and C16) that self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into nanostructures of tunable size (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) and photophysical properties. While C1 exhibits oblique&#8208;type exciton coupling and negligible emission, C8&#8208;C16 bearing longer alkyl chains undergo J&#8208;type aggregation with NIR absorption and emission and excellent photoacoustic properties. Given these advantageous features, aza&#8208;BODIPY specific, semi&#8208;quantitative fluorescence reflectance and photoacoustic imaging both in vitro and in vivo are established. Additionally, in vitro cell viability as well as murine in vivo biodistribution analysis with ex vivo validation showed excellent biocompatibility and a size&#8208;dependent biodistribution of nanostructures to different organ beds. These results broaden the scope of aqueous self&#8208;assembly to multimodal imaging and highlight its great potential for rationalizing numerous biomedical questions.

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 Using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

A dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of N2 acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; source of a dimagnesium(I) diradical in formal reductive coupling and cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving various combinations of the simple gaseous small molecules, C2H4, CO, CO2, and H2. A range of more complex &#8220;value&#8208;added&#8221; organic fragments have been accessed from these processes.








Abstract
Reactions of 1,2&#8208;dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), formed by the two&#8208;electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to the insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with a CO2 analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross&#8208;coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value&#8208;added organic fragments.

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: the Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#9472;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt/nickel catalytic aerobic epoxidation of propylene is described, where the autoxidation of carboxyl esters, as in ethyl acetate, ultimately provides peracetic acid as the oxidizing reagent, resulting in a remarkable epoxide selectivity. The confirmed Co(III)/Co(II) active center is stabilized through its interaction with nickel, involvement in the oxidation of the ethoxy radical (an intermediate from the ester C&#9472;O bond cleavage), as well as the single&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen.








Abstract
The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#9472;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation is demonstrated. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#9472;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. The research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular lithium borate which features a polydentate structure is reported here. The reversible supramolecular chelating/de&#8208;chelating of Li&#8314; enables the sequentially controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. Therefore, a homogeneous and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters and LiF is rationally fabricated. The precise control over interfacial chemistry significantly enhances interfacial protection, thereby improving battery cycling stability.








Abstract
The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) is paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide&#8208;based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center are designed and synthesized. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ can sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#9472;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cerium&#8208;Mediated C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Deconstructive Diversification of Cyclic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of strained and non&#8208;strained cyclic tertiary acids (3&#8211;12&#8208;membered rings) under Ce/photocatalysis, with air as the sole oxidant, is reported. This strategy enables the construction of C&#9472;CN, carbon&#8211;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and carbon&#9472;oxime bonds to form various functionalized carbonyl compounds. Late&#8208;stage modifications generate valuable molecular modules, providing a pathway for antipsychotic drug synthesis. 








Abstract
The selective cleavage of inert carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in unstrained rings continues to pose a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Current methods for C(sp3) &#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition&#8208;metal catalysis to facilitate ring&#8208;opening via small&#8208;ring strain or inducing &#946;&#8208;fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre&#8208;installed in the substrate. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring&#8208;opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#9472;CN, C&#8208;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and C&#9472;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre&#8208;installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.

         <title>Exploiting Antisite Defects in FeWN2 Nanosheets for Enol Electro&#8208;oxidation Coupled with H2 Evolution at a Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered 2D FeWN2 electrocatalyst with a rock&#8208;salt structure and abundant antisite defects is designed to enhance the electrocatalytic upgrading of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The presence of antisite defects effectively modulates the electronic structure, facilitating the activation of enol groups in AA.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from biomass electro&#8208;oxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electro&#8208;oxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant antisite defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.69&#160;V (vs RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#160;V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60 &#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.

         <title>&#8220;Pulsed&#8221; Chain Transfer Anionic Polymerization: A Green and Cost&#8208;Effective Approach for Controlled Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy significantly enhances catalyst atom economy in living polymerization by introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions. The temperature&#8208;sensitive catalytic system allows multiple regenerations of the initiator without using expensive organometallic compounds such as ZnEt2 or MgBu2. This green and cost&#8208;effective approach achieves up to 1500% initiator efficiency and enables the synthesis of polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, providing a sustainable alternative for producing well&#8208;defined, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. 








Abstract
Herein, we report a method that significantly enhances the atom economy of catalysts in living polymerization. By introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions during the polymerization process, multiple regenerations of the catalyst are achieved while preserving the &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled characteristics. The specially designed catalytic system, composed of 1,2&#8208;dipyrrolidinoethane/n&#8208;butyllithium/n&#8208;butylpotassium/toluene, exhibits a chain&#8208;transfer rate that is highly sensitive to temperature. It enables living polymerization at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, rapid chain transfer to toluene occurs. Utilizing this characteristic, polymerization is initially carried out at low temperatures; once the monomer is consumed, increasing the temperature promotes chain transfer, resulting in initiator regeneration. The regenerated initiator can then initiate new cycles of living polymerization upon the addition of fresh monomers. This process was repeated for more than a dozen cycles, achieving an initiator efficiency of up to 1500%. Using this method, we successfully synthesized polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymer with an extremely narrow molecular weight distribution (&#272; = 1.1). The mechanism was investigated by in situ NMR spectroscopy, MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations. This approach is particularly well&#8208;suited for the controllable, green, and cost&#8208;effective production of low&#8208; to medium&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers and block copolymers.

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers Using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers are a unique class of macromolecules with densely grafted side chains along a central long backbone. A comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single bottlebrush polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging. Here, we synthesized AIEgen&#8208;based bottlebrush polymers using ROMP. The expected AIE phenomenon clearly visualized the steric crowding effect among the densely grafted side chains in bottlebrush polymers.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterward, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide, which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst, (H2IMes)(pyr)2(Cl)2Ru&#160;=&#160;CHPh (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. This work bridges AIE technology with polymer science and especially bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens the bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.

         <title>Enabling Aryl Chloride&#8208;Mediated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis with aryl chlorides is achieved by employing a secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBE and XPhos ligand, resulting in diverse ortho/ipso difunctionalizations of arenes.








Abstract
While the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis has become increasingly useful for arene functionalization, its substrate scope has been mainly restricted to reactive aryl iodides and bromides. Despite being a more available and attractive feedstock, common aryl chlorides have not been used as substrates for the Pd/NBE catalysis. Herein, we report the first general Pd/NBE&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of aryl chlorides. Enabled by the combination of secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBEs and XPhos ligand, diverse aryl chlorides can now undergo successful ortho alkylation, amination, and acylation with different ipso terminations, including olefination, hydrogenation, and alkynylation. To show the utility of this method, late&#8208;stage derivatizations of complex bioactive compounds and sequential functionalizations of polyhaloarenes have been achieved.

         <title>Precise Tuning of Functional Group Spatial Distribution on Porphyrin Rings for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The atropisomers o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO2RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH4 selectivity.








Abstract
Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino&#8208;porphyrin (o&#8208;TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin&#8208;salicylimine&#8208;Cu (o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa) with hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH4 under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH4. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket&#8208;like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO2 adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.

The ordered D&#8211;A components in MOFs provide a driving force for the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without additional cocatalysts. Due to the arrayed uncoordinated carboxyl groups, D&#8211;A MOFs form dual channels for rapid proton transfer. Efficient charge separation and fast proton transport kinetics of the D&#8211;A MOFs promote the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The arrangement of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8211;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8211;A MOFs leads to an increase in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8211;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generating photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network endows 2 with higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.

P&#8594;B motifs are readily and regioselectively appended to pyrene and anthracene. In contrast with the borylative fusion approach recently developed for related N&#8594;B&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such P&#8594;B functionalization does not extend the &#960;&#8208;system. Nevertheless, it significantly impacts the electronic, photophysical, and electrochemical properties.








Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with N&#8594;B Lewis pairs, so&#8208;called borylative fusion, has recently emerged as a simple and powerful means to modulate their electronic and photophysical properties thanks to the extension of the &#960; system. Herein, we considered a new class of PAHs appended with phosphine&#8594;borane Lewis pairs and investigated pyrene as well as anthracene derivatives. In these compounds, strong P&#8594;B interactions are enforced geometrically, but the &#960;&#8208;system is not extended. Nevertheless, such P&#8594;B functionalization was found to significantly impact the optical and electrochemical properties. The P,B&#8208;functionalized PAHs display noticeably reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and enhanced fluorescence. Both the number and position of P&#8594;B units turned out to play a significant role.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 is reported for the electrohydrogenation of olefins under unusual high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source and reductant, respectively. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Additionally, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 60 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Readily Visualized Perfluorooctanoic Acid Detection Using a Small Molecule Chemosensor</title>

A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid&#8208;phase extraction. Detection limits as low as 40 ppt in deionized water and 100 ppt in tap water are achieved using a smartphone&#8208;based color scan &#8220;app&#8221;. This method offers a simple and effective approach for trace PFOA detection in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace&#8208;level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

         <title>Yb3+&#8208;Induced Bright Ligand Up&#8208;Conversion Luminescence in 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Doping Yb3&#8314; ions into Ln coordination polymers (Ln&#8208;CPs) with the formula [Y2(FCA)6]n (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) has led to the preparation of 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n. Up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) of the ligand is visibly observed in [Y0.6Yb1.4(FCA)6]n, with an absolute up&#8208;conversion quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.003&#160;%.








Abstract
Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms.

Herein, by doping Yb3&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n 1) (FCA&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n (x&#160;=&#160;0.2, 2) x&#160;=&#160;0.5, 3) x&#160;=&#160;0.7, 4) x&#160;=&#160;0.9, 5) x&#160;=&#160;1, 6) are prepared.

         <title>Against the Wallach's Rule Through Rational Design of Metal&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites Toward Efficient Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the cyclohexanediammonium cations to construct the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites, thereby challenging the Wallach's rule. Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence is achieved by strategically weakening the interactions between adjacent chiral cations. The obtained chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite demonstrates an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 71.22% together with |glum| of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The potential applications of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials in chiroptical devices have attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, the design of efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescent pure organic materials remains a significant challenge, largely due to the limitations imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law and Wallach's rule. In this study, the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite strategy is employed to overcome these restrictions. The introduction of cyclohexylenediammonium cations as the A&#8208;site of chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites results in the generation of an efficient near&#8208;infrared/red phosphorescence at 637&#160;nm with a lifetime of up to 227.98 &#181;s. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach up to 71.22%, accompanied by an anisotropy factor of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The figure of merit (FM&#160;=&#160;PLQY&#215; |glum|) is 6.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is the highest value achieved among all the pure organic circularly polarized phosphorescent materials. The work proposes a unique strategy to achieve highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence based on non&#8208;conjugated luminophores, which is accomplished by combining the superior optical and electronic properties of metal&#8208;free perovskites with chirality based on the rational molecular design.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Upgrading of Biomass and CO2 Utilization Using Fe/Ni&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotubes Derived from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, fossil fuel consumption has led to petroleum shortages and high carbon emissions. Thus, this study explores renewable resources for the electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and carbon monoxide (CO), from hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and carbon dioxide (CO2), respectively, using Fe/Ni&#8208;supported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) catalysts derived from CO2, achieving a faradaic efficiency of FDCA as 99.60% and 96.25% for CO.








Abstract
Fossil fuel consumption has caused petroleum shortages and increased carbon emissions; thus, utilizing renewable resources in biorefineries for biomass&#8208;derived chemical synthesis is promising. Among them, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a key alternative to terephthalic acid (PTA) for sustainable polyester production. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient approach for the simultaneous production of FDCA while utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) via an electrochemical approach. Complete electrooxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode yields FDCA, while CO&#8322; reduction at the cathode produces valuable compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO). This concurrent HMF electrooxidation and CO&#8322; electroreduction strategy enables high&#8208;value chemical production at mild conditions. In addition, we developed efficient single catalysts, FeNi metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes deposited on nickel foam (FeNiCNTs/NF) as both the anode and the cathode for HMF oxidation and CO2 reduction, respectively. Remarkably, faradaic efficiencies reached 99.60% for FDCA (FEFDCA) at the anode and 96.25% for CO (FECO) at the cathode. This study highlights the effective use of synthesized non&#8208;noble metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived CNTs for integrated biorefinery and CO&#8322; utilization.

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI &#8208;Based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of individual non&#8208;radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet&#8208;triplet splittings.








Abstract
The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.

         <title>Electronic Localization Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

We propose an electron localization strategy to effectively suppresses the interfacial side reactions by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within PS4 tetrahedron of Li6PS5Cl through atom&#8208;scale dual&#8208;substitution of yttrium and oxygen. This approach greatly enhances the interfacial stability and enables an ultrahigh cycling performance of 100% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C.








Abstract
Argyrodite&#8208;based sulfide electrolytes have received considerable attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries owing to their high ionic conductivity and good mechanical property. However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air&#8208;stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800&#160;h. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with LiCoO2/Li&#8208;In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C. This study presents a distinct strategy that employs the electron localization driven by modulating orbital hybridization to achieve ultrastable interface in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemically Tailored Peptide Binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to Enable Versatile Design of Membrane Protein&#8208;Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 developed by a structure&#8208;guided design strategy are used to establish a novel E3 ligase&#8208;mediated modular platform for membrane protein degradation. This innovative system enables robust generation of synthetic bispecific chimeras featuring enhanced structural diversity and smaller size. The platform demonstrates broad applicability in degrading diverse membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets, including programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).








Abstract
Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the AlphaFold&#8208;predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e., PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta C&#9472;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. 








Abstract
Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote metaselective C&#9472;H functionalization of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8211;norbornyl&#8211;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.

         <title>Elucidating the Boundary of Intercalation vs Sequestration in Supramolecular Polymers by Retrosynthetic Design Toward the Construction of Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By retrosynthetically analyzing the molecular structure of an intercalator, clear design principles toward supramolecular sequestration can be obtained. Investigating a model supramolecular polymer in the presence of these additives offers a general approach toward dilution&#8208;induced polymerization and complex hybrid systems of dual sequestration and hybrid mechanisms of sequestration and intercalation.








Abstract
Controlled social self&#8208;sorting by intercalation can offer distinct properties at the supramolecular level that go beyond the sum of its parts. Likewise, controlling narcissistic self&#8208;sorting by sequestration can induce unique system properties. In contrast, the interface between the two cases has hitherto remained underexplored, and clear design rules remain elusive. Herein it is demonstrated that by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular similarity of supramolecular synthons, intricate control over concerted supramolecular equilibria can be achieved. By reducing the molecular similarity, a former intercalator can be tuned to become a strong or weak sequestrator. Understanding these roles in binary mixtures allows to rationalize more complex tertiary systems. Consequently, the influence of an uncommon dual sequestration mechanism is revealed. Further, an unprecedented hybrid mechanism between supramolecular intercalation and sequestration can be demonstrated. We are hopeful that the results presented herein will contribute to the development and understanding of concerted processes in complex supramolecular systems.

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the p&#8208;block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p&#8208;d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of the p-block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p-d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pt-based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d-band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzobisoxazole&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality, benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged, fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. COF&#8208;JLU45 displayed an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with superior reusability via water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have attracted extensive interest in solar energy to hydrogen conversion. However, insufficient light harvesting and difficult exciton dissociation severely limit the improvement of photocatalytic activity for COFs, thereby impeding the progression of this advanced field. In this work, two benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged and fully conjugated 2D&#8208;COFs with triazine (COF&#8208;JLU44) and pyrene (COF&#8208;JLU45) units were constructed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation, and they hold long&#8208;range ordered structures, largely acceptable surface area, and fascinating photoelectric properties. Significantly, COF&#8208;JLU45 exhibits an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and superior reusability in the presence of 1.0 wt% Pt under light irradiation, coupled with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9% at a long wavelength of 600&#160;nm. Multiple spectroscopy and theoretical simulation demonstrate the ingenious design of COF&#8208;JLU45 widen its light absorption and effectively promote the exciton dissociation. This finding contributes valuable insights for constructing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and utilization.

         <title>Biphenylene Coordination and Ring&#8208;Opening by Alkali&#8208;Metal Nickelates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal (Li, Na, and K) nickelates that coordinate biphenylene in a &#951;4&#8208;motif have been prepared and structurally characterized. These low&#8208;valent heterobimetallic complexes undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative addition of the central C&#9472;C bond of biphenylene, which is highly dependent on the identity of the alkali&#8208;metal and carbanionic scaffold.








Abstract
The pre&#8208;coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low&#8208;valent phenyl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal nickelates containing a &#951;4&#8208;coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali&#8208;metal cation (Li, Na, or K) influence the rate of C&#9472;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#9472;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl&#8208;carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring&#8208;opening.

         <title>Single&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Visible&#8208;Spectrum White Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The high luminescence efficiency stems from the constructed heterojunction interface, which blocks the detrimental energy&#8208;migration process.








Abstract
Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, a generalization strategy is developed that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent detrimental energy transfer processes, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (&#8776;93.9), a low correlated color temperature (&#8776;3100&#160;K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphors are excellent candidates for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspires the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.

         <title>Homochiral Helical Poly(thiophene)s Accessed via Living Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of helical conjugated poly(thiophene)s via living catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization. The polymers have narrow dispersities (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.10), can be accessed with controlled molecular weights (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;100), and are stable in acids, bases, and strong nucleophiles. We envision these polymers will be useful in biomimetic and organic electronic applications due to the degree of control over the polymer structure and stability.








Abstract
Synthetic helical polymers form compact, ordered, and inherently chiral structures, enabling their uses in biomimetic applications as well as catalysis. A challenge in using synthetic helical polymers, however, is their tendency to be sensitive to pH and the presence of nucleophiles, Lewis&#8208;acids, or metal ions. We report a strategy to overcome these shortcomings by adapting catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization, a living chain&#8208;growth polymerization typically used to access linear conjugated polymers, for the synthesis of helical poly(thiophene)s. We demonstrate that the helical poly(thiophene)s can be synthesized with a single helicity, incorporated into block copolymers, and functionalized at the chain&#8208;ends, enabling further conjugation and functionalization. The helical poly(thiophene)s are stable to a variety of conditions, providing benefits over other helical polymers which contain sensitive imine or carbonyl&#8208;based functional groups. We anticipate that the ability to access homochiral, heterotelechelic helical conjugated polymers and copolymers will enable new uses of these materials in optoelectronics as well as in applications for mimicking biomacromolecules and other polymers with precisely defined sequences.

         <title>Electrochemical Pilot H2O2 Production by Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Reactor: Insights From a Hybrid Catalyst for 2&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined transition metal hydroxides (NiFeW LDH, NiFe LDH, Ni(OH)&#8322;) with OCNTs electrocatalysts, carefully designed water dissociation active centers, and employed an innovative membrane&#8208;free microchannel CER electrolyte configuration to generate pure H&#8322;O&#8322; in a pilot electrolyzer, achieving an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 15 A and 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers an alluring and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) synthesis. However, challenges remain in developing scalable electrocatalysts and cost&#8208;effective reactors for high&#8208;purity H&#8322;O&#8322; production. This study introduces a simple yet effective mechanical mixing method to fabricate a hybrid electrocatalyst from oxidized carbon nanotubes and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). This easily accessible and low&#8208;cost catalyst achieves near&#8208;perfect Faradaic efficiency (&#8764;100%) with low overpotentials of 73&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 and 588&#160;mV at 400&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in a solid electrolyte cell. Through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ analyses, we uncover the pivotal role played by the LDH co&#8208;catalyst in fine&#8208;tuning the local pH at the catalyst/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface that drives both the activity and selectivity. We also design a low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state reactor using cation&#8208;exchange resin (CER) as both a proton conductor and a microchannel for efficient mass transfer, achieving a production rate of 5.29&#160;mmol cm&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; and continuous output concentrations of 11.8&#160;wt.% H&#8322;O&#8322;. Scaled to an industrial area of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;100 cm2, the pilot reactor achieves an impressive H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate of approximately 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; at 15 A, marking a significant advancement in sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; production.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The novel dual&#8208;site catalyst Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC demonstrates distinct catalytic functions, where the MoC sites exhibit high efficacy in catalyzing the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S8 to Li2S4. Concurrently, the Ni&#8208;N4 sites facilitate the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S4 to Li2S. This dual functionality synergistically enhances the overall Li&#8208;S redox process while mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites.








Abstract
The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8328; to Li&#8322;S&#8324;), while Ni&#8208;N4 sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S), resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the complete Li&#8208;S redox process. When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution, effectively mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries employing an S/Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC cathode and a Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC@PP separator demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, retaining 590&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; after 800 cycles. At a sulfur loading of 8.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2 and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.

Abstract
The precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) distribution and interfacial modification is pivotal for advancing the performance of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAM orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveal that TPAI binds with SAM via &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation and enhancing the orderliness of self&#8208;assembly. Further characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that &#9472;NH3 group in TPAI coordinates with undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate defects of cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) film. The TPAI modification creates a defect&#8208;minimized buried interface with optimized energy alignment, significantly improving hole extraction and transport kinetics. Consequently, the TPAI&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported value for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400&#160;h. This work provides a molecular&#8208;level strategy for interfacial engineering, advancing the development of efficient and durable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Anomalous Magnetic Hysteresis up to 20&#160;K in a Non&#8208;Kramers Light&#8208;Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The first praseodymium (Pr) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) is designed and synthesized by confining single non&#8208;Kramers light&#8208;lanthanide Pr(III) inside an azafullerene cage, which shows an anomalously high&#8208;temperature magnetic bistability up to 20&#160;K, the highest value among all reported light&#8208;lanthanide SMMs, without employing a demanding strong axial ligand field.








Abstract
Light&#8208;lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy&#8208;Ln counterparts, and so far, only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2&#160;K. Here, we report a low&#8208;coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely, Pr@C81N, featuring a non&#8208;Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr&#8208;based SMM. Although the weak nonaxial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer&#8208;spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C81N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20&#160;K using a field sweep rate of 20&#160;Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light&#8208;Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8211;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non&#8208;Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.

&lt;p&gt;The first praseodymium (Pr) single-molecule magnet (SMM) is designed and synthesized by confining single non-Kramers light-lanthanide Pr(III) inside an azafullerene cage, which shows an anomalously high-temperature magnetic bistability up to 20&#160;K, the highest value among all reported light-lanthanide SMMs, without employing a demanding strong axial ligand field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy-Ln counterparts, and so far, only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2&#160;K. Here, we report a low-coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely, Pr@C&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;N, featuring a non-Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr-based SMM. Although the weak nonaxial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer-spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20&#160;K using a field sweep rate of 20&#160;Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light-Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8211;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non-Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Long&#8208;Cycling, and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Trivalent Antimony Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a concentrated chloride electrolyte to address the Sb3+ hydrolysis issue and achieved highly reversible three&#8208;electron Sb plating chemistry, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long life (10 months), and dendrite&#8208;free spherical morphology.








Abstract
Aqueous trivalent metal batteries are promising energy storage systems, which can leverage unique three&#8208;electron redox reactions to deliver high capacity and high energy. Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g&#8722;1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony&#8208;chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long lifespan (7300 h, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb&#8214;MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50&#160;000 cycles (&#8764;70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high&#8208;capacity cathode, which can integrate with low&#8208;potential zinc into novel dual&#8208;metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 h). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high&#8208;charge&#8208;density cations for multivalent battery applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Pillar[5]Arenes Through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is presented for synthesizing inherently chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative CuAAC reaction. By increasing the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule, a wide range of pillar[5]arenes are efficiently prepared in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes have been extensively investigated as carrier materials for applications in host&#8208;guest chemistry, nanoscience, information science, materials science, and other domains. Despite its success, the enantioselective synthesis of pillar[n]arenes is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, a novel asymmetric extended side&#8208;arm strategy is presented for synthesizing chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. An increase in the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule efficiently produced a wide range of pillar[5]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, this principle enables iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to enantioselectively functionalized pillar[5]arenes with different triazoles using a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Electronic Structure of Co&#9472;N&#9472;C Single&#8208;Atomic Sites Toward Excellent Electrochemical H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#9472;N5 site with asymmetric electronic structure was built to improve the activation of O2, moderate the adsorption of *OOH intermediate, and ideally conserve the generated H2O2, achieving the excellent H2O2 selectivity by 92.5%. The 2e&#8722; ORR coupled oxidation further realized the efficient cellulosic biomass upgrading into valued formic acid with a high yield of 92.1%.








Abstract
To advance electrochemical H2O2 production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#9472;N5 site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#9472;N4, effectively overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity in H2O2 production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#9472;N sites promotes the activation of O2 molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediate by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediates&#160;adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H&#8322;O&#8322; production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#9472;N5 achieves a H2O2 production rate as high as 16.1&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&#8722; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose&#8208;derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0%&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro&#8208;refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8315; ORR and the asymmetry of single&#8208;atomic sites, this work paves the way for high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis.

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stable perovskite lattice was achieved by incorporating DMA+, which suppresses the halide phase segregation under both high&#8208;power illumination and high&#8208;bias voltage. The resultant perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with active areas of 0.062 and 1.004 cm2 achieved remarkable PCEs of 26.15% (certified: 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, and showed excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with T90 of &#8764;1350&#160;h.








Abstract
The operational perovskite/organic tandems are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8722; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#9472;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34&#160;V.

&lt;p&gt;An intrinsically stable perovskite lattice was achieved by incorporating DMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which suppresses the halide phase segregation under both high-power illumination and high-bias voltage. The resultant perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with active areas of 0.062 and 1.004 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieved remarkable PCEs of 26.15% (certified: 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, and showed excellent long-term operational stability with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8764;1350&#160;h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operational perovskite/organic tandems are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single-junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a larger ionic radius entering the A-site of lattice tilts the [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#9472;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high-power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi-Fermi-level splitting values, delivering a high open-circuit voltage of 1.34&#160;V. Notably, 0.062-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.004-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; perovskite/organic tandems achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; &#8764; 1350&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy was proposed to address the transmembrane CO2 loss issue in alkaline CO2 electrolysis. By utilizing anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) as the redox mediator, the system could operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion while simultaneously enabling efficient recovery of transmembrane CO2 gas.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and nontransmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, maintaining a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2.&#160;This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to all Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial monomer free energy of polymerization (&#8710;GROP) is traditionally regarded as the benchmark for the polymer's chemical recyclability. But if we instead consider every ring size present at equilibrium (&#8710;GRCE), a different viewpoint emerges. We found that polymers previously regarded as unsuitable for chemical recycling are highly chemically recyclable at low temperatures under the right concentration and catalytic conditions.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on, via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.

         <dc:description>A simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization, which also offers valuable insights into bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo&#8208;metallic catalysis with the assistance of overdosed additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous nickel catalysts have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1&#8208;butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y shows unprecedent performance with 1&#8208;butene formation rate of 3.8 &#215; 105&#160;h&#8722;1 and 1&#8208;butene selectivity of 91.2&#160;%, without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the in&#8208;situ generated Ni&#8208;alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via the Cossee&#8208;Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance.

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif for Anion Recognition in Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diboronic acids are an anion recognition motif that provides strong and directional binding to oxoanions in aqueous media. This motif provides a selectivity profile that is distinct from other anion recognition groups, and binding affinities that are superior to those of simple amides and (thio)ureas. A simple receptor featuring two gem&#8208;diboronic acid motifs was found to be one of the most selective malonate receptors disclosed to date.








Abstract
Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal's secondary coordination sphere, but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.

Studies with a receptor bearing two &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;Life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The choice of solvent in piezocatalytic Au extraction is critical to electron transfer, radical generation, and mass transport. The CH3CN&#8211;water solvent system emerges as the optimal medium, achieving a balance of oxidation ability, coordination ability, scalability, and environmental safety, resulting in a highly efficient and selective Au recovery.








Abstract
Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8211;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of glycolipids reminiscent of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall were synthesized and their supramolecular structures in aqueous acetone were imaged by transmission electron microscopy. The self&#8208;assembled structures are affected by subtle changes in the number of sugar residues, type of glycosidic linkages, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes in the lipid.








Abstract
The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, which features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Minute Fabrication of Metal Organic Framework Membranes via Additive&#8208;Accelerated Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;minute fabrication of permselective metal organic framework membranes via additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition is developed by using catecholamine as both biomimetic mineralization inducer and grain&#8208;boundary adhesive. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8@DA membranes exhibited excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with C3H6 permeance of 145&#160;&#177;&#160;12 GPU and C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151&#160;&#177;&#160;8, surpassing most of MOF membranes.








Abstract
Efficient fabrication of metal organic framework (MOF) membranes is important for their broad applications in molecular separations. However, current approaches for MOF membrane fabrication are usually time&#8208;consuming due to the slow, random nucleation and crystal growth, particularly the lack of in&#8208;situ defect healing ability. Here, we report an additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition method, which allows ultrafast fabrication of MOF membranes through the synergy of electric field and catecholamine additives. The strong electric field facilitates the directed nucleation of MOF on the substrates while the multifunctional additives accelerate the MOF crystallization, growth and grain&#8208;boundary defect healing. Consequently, we fabricate well&#8208;intergrown, uniform MOF (ZIF&#8208;8) membranes with an ultrathin thickness of &#8764;180&#160;nm in 30 s, which is the most rapid fabrication of MOF membranes till now. The membranes exhibit superior C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with a C3H6 permeance of 145 GPU and a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151, as well as good stability at high pressure of 7&#160;bar, and the ultrafast membrane fabrication can be achieved on commercial ceramic substrates, exhibiting the potential for practical applications. This work may establish a platform for fast and controllable fabrication of MOF membranes as well as many other membranes based on metal&#8208;coordination chemistry.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction, an electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed based on host&#8211;guest recognition mediated by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) on NiO. The anchored CB[8] could preorganize the NAD+ in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to approach the Ni&#8208;Had on NiO, resulting in a high regioselectivity up to 97.8%. 








Abstract
Efficient regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactors, particularly 1,4&#8208;NADH, is crucial for advancing oxidoreductase catalysis. Electrocatalysis provides a promising route for 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration, but an expensive catalyst, typically a rhodium organometallic complex, is frequently required to guarantee the high selectivity of 1,4&#8208;NADH, significantly limiting its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction in nature, a direct electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed by modification of the surface of nickel oxide (NiO) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) (denoted as CB[8]&#8211;NiO). The host&#8211;guest interaction between CB[8] and NAD+ was proved, which is similar in principle to substrate&#8211;enzyme&#8208;specific recognition. CB[8] acted as a catalytic pocket for NAD+, providing a suitable cavity volume to accommodate the positively charged nicotinamide part of NAD+. NAD+ entered the CB[8] cavity and approached the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to achieve the regioselective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. Remarkably higher 1,4&#8208;NADH selectivity of 97.8% on CB[8]&#8211;NiO was obtained at &#8722;0.47&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) than that of bare NiO (77.4%).

A largest all&#8208;alkynyl protected rod&#8208;shaped Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene) trimetallic nanocluster has been synthesized and its structure determined by SCXRD. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28. Compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits exceptional photothermal conversion capability (&#951;&#160;=&#160;84.7%, &#9651;T&#160;=&#160;51.5 &#176;C, &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2, 12&#160;&#181;M). TA spectroscopy reveals that the &#964;e&#8208;ph of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1 shows excellent photothermal therapy of cancer cells at low concentration and low laser power.








Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity intermetallic nanoclusters are important for investigating the evolution of alloy materials from atoms to plasmonic alloy nanoparticles. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) is still challenging. In this work, an all&#8208;alkynyl protected trimetallic nanocluster of unprecedented size, Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene), has been synthesized and its total structure determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The metal core of 1 is rod&#8208;like in structure, with a length of 1.92&#160;nm and a width of 1.45&#160;nm. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#63741;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that 1 features a HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 0.29&#160;eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of &#8764;51.5 &#176;C within 5&#160;min (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12&#160;&#181;M in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8211;phonon coupling (&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a critical insight into the hydrogenation mechanism, implying that facet engineering can balance hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation reaction. The Co3O4(100) facet with abundant oxygen vacancies can not only boost water dissociation to generate active hydrogen but also effectively utilize these intermediates for nitrate reduction, thereby shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such a strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8722;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we reveal that the oxygen vacancies on crystal facet can greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8722;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8&#160;g&#8208;N&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;d&#8722;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8722;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Unveil the Failure of Alkali Ion&#8208;Sulfur Aqueous Batteries: Resolving Water Migration by Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal an overlooked issue of water migration in decoupled systems, which leads to sulfur species dissolution and thus irreversible sulfur redox reactions. By investigating the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration, the MPI of the electrolyte is proposed as a universal descriptor. In practice, an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is proven effective in resolving water migration and constructing stable alkali ion&#8208;SABs effectively.








Abstract
Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion&#8208;SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion&#8208;SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na+&#8208;SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the versatility of the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is further substantiated in Li+&#8208;SAB and K+&#8208;SAB batteries, boosting the scope of the following SAB systems.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Ultraviolet Light&#8208;Activated Asymmetric Photopolymerization for the Synthesis of CPL&#8208;Active Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

This work develops a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL, &#955;em&#160;=&#160;360&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;0.188), achieved through thermodynamic regulation of the chiral supramolecular assembly. The asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257&#8208;based blend film can be realized by utilizing the CP&#8208;UVL as a chiral excitation source, resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072).








Abstract
Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL) offers significant potential for practical applications in asymmetric photocatalysis and photopolymerization. However, the development of CP&#8208;UVL&#8208;active materials has been hindered by their low emission dissymmetry factors (gem). Here, we present a high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL material for asymmetric photopolymerization, achieved through thermodynamic regulation of a chiral supramolecular assembly. The chiral coassembled enantiomers, R/S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7, are synthesized using the naphthylamine derivative R/S&#8208;BNC as the chiral donor and OXD&#8208;7 as the achiral acceptor. Upon annealing at different temperatures, OXD&#8208;7 detaches from the chiral coassembly of S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7 and then self&#8208;assembles into ordered helical nanostructures, exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent CP&#8208;UVL (&#955;em = 360&#160;nm, with gem up to&#160;+0.188). Remarkably, the strong CP&#8208;UVL emission acts as a chiral excitation source, triggering the asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257 (which contains the achiral dye TPABBI and the photoinitiator Irg651), resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072). This study provides a simple yet effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL materials for CPL&#8208;induced asymmetric photopolymerization.

         <title>Selectively Deoxygenative Deuteration of Aldehydes by Superwetting Porous Carbon&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a class of superwetting carbon&#8208;supported Pd catalysts, which facilitate the site&#8208;specific deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes to aromatics with &#8208;CD3 group benefitting from the catalyst's surface polarity and electron&#8208;rich effect.








Abstract
We present a method of deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes (DDA) over heterogeneously superwetting porous carbon&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SPC), which is efficient for the synthesis of deuterated aromatic compounds with &#8208;CD3 group. Exemplified by the DDA reaction of 2&#8208;naphthaldehyde (2&#8208;NAL) to 2&#8208;methylnaphthalene (2&#8208;MNE), the total deuterium incorporation radio in the resultant aromatic hydrocarbons was higher than 95% and the selectivity toward 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3 reached 87%. The impressed catalytic activity was found relevant to the combined effect of surface wettability and the electron&#8208;rich properties of Pd species of this kind of heterogeneous Pd/SPC catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggest a successive deuteration pathway, that is, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), deuterium addition, and ultimate deoxygenative deuteration over Pd/SPC in the cost&#8208;effective D2O/H2 reaction conditions. The in situ&#8208;formed D2 from the first step HIE between H2 and D2O can be readily captured by the electron&#8208;rich Pd centers, which then boost the subsequent deuterogenolysis of C&#9472;O bonds through deuterated alcohol intermediates toward the formation of 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3. This work provides a design principle of heterogeneous catalysts for targeted deuterium labeling from aldehyde substrates and may inspire the development of alternative deuterium labeling techniques beyond dominated homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Pd Ensemble Sites Tuned Local Environment of Cu Catalysts for Matching Propyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of catalytic hydrogenations exemplified by the propyne hydrogenation here are obediently regulated by manipulating the local environments. The presence of Pd ensemble sites is shown to enable a facile dissociation of hydrogen and control the hydrogenation via the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for propyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring local environments of active sites to match targeted configuration of key species is significant for controlling reaction pathways in selective hydrogenations. Herein, differently typed Pd sites are introduced onto Cu catalysts to tune the local environment of Cu sites for controlling the configuration of semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway of propyne hydrogenation used in production of polymer&#8208;grade propylene. Detailed structure characterizations demonstrate the controllable construction of Pd single&#8208;atom and Pd ensemble sites modified Cu surfaces and PdCu alloy via fine tuning the Pd/Cu ratios. Catalytic tests, kinetics analysis, and temperature&#8208;programmed experiments demonstrate that the presence of Pd ensemble sites on Cu surface directly catalyzes the hydrogenation of propyne that occurs on the Cu sites in other cases, and enables a facile activation for hydrogen and simultaneously promotes the desorption of propylene against its hydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to target propylene is up to 95.3% at the full conversion of propyne on the corresponding Pd0.1Cu catalyst. In contrast, the C&#9472;C coupling pathway is quite facile on the Cu surface tuned by single&#8208;atom Pd sites, which is similar to that on the pristine Cu sites on the Cu catalyst, and the well&#8208;defined Pd&#9472;Cu coordination on PdCu alloy catalyst leads to facile over&#8208;hydrogenation process.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs is proposed. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2 are synthesized, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts a heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements reveals stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.

The &lt;i&gt;ab-initio&lt;/i&gt; calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK-1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*-&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;-conjugation in DNDK-2 leads to marginal n&#960;*-&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta-arranged carbonyl-Ar-carbonyl and meta-arranged N-Ar-N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;-conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;-conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl-embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Hydrogen Vacancies on Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites have a dramatic influence on the non&#8208;radiative recombination. It can exhibit multiple metastable configurations, resulting in variations in carrier capture coefficient by over 10 orders of magnitude. By uncovering the negligible role of hydrogen vacancies on the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial, thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
Hydrogen vacancies (VH) were considered major non&#8208;radiative recombination centers in hybrid perovskites. By employing a multiscale approach that combines first&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations, our findings indicated that the VH impact was overestimated due to the previous metastable VH configurations. The organic molecules with VH located on either the nitrogen or carbon atom act as the ligands that form energetically stable dimers with Pb2+ cations. These dimers lower VH energy by 0.35&#8211;0.97&#160;eV in MAPbI3 and by 0.88&#8211;1.01&#160;eV in FAPbI3, compared to non&#8208;bonding configurations. These dimers significantly boosted potential energy barriers of hole capture, resulting in a dramatic reduction in carrier capture coefficients by over 10 orders of magnitude. Consequently, the total capture coefficients (Ctotal) for the dominant VH in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are on the order of 10&#8722;17 and 10&#8722;31 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1, respectively. By uncovering the negligible impact of VH on non&#8208;radiative recombination, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial (with a capture coefficient on the order of 10&#8722;8 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1), thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Steering the Product Selectivity of CO2&#160;Electroreduction by Single Atom Switching in Isostructural Copper Nanocluster Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of isostructural Cu nanoclusters (Cu13 and Cu14) with one&#8208;atom&#8208;change was synthesized by precisely single atom manipulation. One atom switching steers electrochemical CO2 reduction direction, in which Cu13 shows barely activity towards only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V, while, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V.








Abstract
Even single atom manipulation can cause drastic changes in catalytic activity and selectivity, especially in atomic&#8208;level catalysts. However, it is challenging to accurately elucidate the influence of specific atoms on performance due to the intertwined factors in catalysts. Atomically precise isostructural nanoclusters (NCs) can serve as ideal platforms to uncover the impact of individual atoms on catalytic properties. Herein, a pair of isostructural Cu NCs ([Cu13(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)7H10]0 and [Cu14(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)8H10]+ namely as Cu13 and Cu14) were synthesized. In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, Cu13 shows barely any activity toward only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V. In contrast, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V. Based on the crystallographic and computational analyses, the extra Cu at the top in Cu14 squeezes the H connected with three core Cu into the center of the same plane, optimizing the electronic structure and thereby promoting CO2 activation and H2O dissociation, which is further confirmed by comprehensive in situ characterizations, kinetic experiments, and theoretical calculations. This work provides a unique isostructural NCs system to gain fundamental insights into switching catalytic reactivity by single&#8208;atom manipulation.

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next&#8208;generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM&#8208;WEs.








Abstract
Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION&#8208;A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non&#8208;noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM&#8208;WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&#8722;2 (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;m KOH). Moreover, the AEM&#8208;WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>

Iron single atoms in double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs)&#8208;based catalysts substituted the oxidants and dissolved oxygen as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07, and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere.








Abstract
Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate [PMS] addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.

         <title>Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Nanotraps and Multisite Adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polymer microsphere &#947;CD&#8208;PF was constructed utilizing hydrogen bond&#8208;incorporating cyclodextrins and conjugated hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene. The removal efficiencies exceeding 98% for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s, with pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order adsorption kinetics constants (k2) of 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, respectively. The ultrafast adsoprtion is facilitated by a hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotrap&#8208;dominated multisite adsorption, which follows an initial electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced surface enrichment.








Abstract
The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong&#8208;binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps dominant multisite adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, &#946;CD&#8208;PF and &#947;CD&#8208;PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The &#947;CD&#8208;PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s. &#947;CD&#8208;PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1&#160;ppm) can be effectively treated with &#947;CD&#8208;PF to achieve a concentration far below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (0.003&#160;ppm) within 30&#160;s. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multisite mechanism: electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high&#8208;density hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps in &#947;CD&#8208;PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Near Infrared/Shortwave Infrared Emissive Chromophores: Synthesis of Triphenylamine&#8208;Appended Pyrazinacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active triphenylamine&#8208;appended pyrazinacenes show extreme reversible redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties. In their reduced state, absorption and emission bands fall well within the visible region. Oxidation results in a shift in the absorption and fluorescence bands to the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions while maintaining high fluorescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Organic dyes showing absorbance and fluorescence in the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions are attractive for a variety of applications. Redox&#8208;coupled reversible switching of absorbance or fluorescence implies enhanced functionality of such dyes, especially where large changes in photophysical properties across the redox process can be realized. Here, the synthesis of two new pyrazinacenes containing four and five fused pyrazine units, appended with electron&#8208;donor triphenylamine groups, and redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties is reported. In their reduced state, the compounds show absorbance and fluorescence in the visible region. Reversible shifts in absorbance and fluorescence from the visible to the near infrared or even short&#8208;wave infrared regions are observed upon chemical and electrochemical oxidations. Such large redox&#8208;coupled shifts in photophysical properties are unprecedented for a redox process that affects only a single, six&#8208;membered ring in which both reduced and oxidized states consist of neutral, closed&#8208;shell species. The compounds show high fluorescence quantum yields in their reduced states, and oxidized species show fluorescence quantum yields that compare well with existing near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared active fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Universal Albumin Drugs&#8208;Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad&#8208;SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>

         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step aptamer modification of FDA&#8208;approved albumin drugs, we developed a versatile albumin drugs&#8208;spherical nucleic acid (adSNA) platform with tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, high aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, diverse drug loading capabilities, and simplified preparation with reduced costs. This platform achieves precise drug delivery, shows promising tumor mild photothermal therapy, and allows single&#8208;batch synthesis for clinical translation.








Abstract
Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy. However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications. Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities, and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures. In addition, the adSNAs are straightforward to synthesize and scalable for large&#8208;scale production, offering significant potential to advance the development of clinical targeted drugs.

         <title>Precise PBAEs: A Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Molecularly Defined Gene&#8208;Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, single&#8208;molecularly defined poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters) are synthesized for gene delivery. These precisely defined polymers exhibit relatively high gene&#8208;delivery efficiency and low toxicity, highlighting their potential for advanced therapeutic applications. The precise polymers also reveal new design principles for polymer&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery vectors, emphasizing the impact of structural precision.








Abstract
Gene&#8208;delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene&#8208;delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, single-molecularly defined poly(&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino esters) are synthesized for gene delivery. These precisely defined polymers exhibit relatively high gene-delivery efficiency and low toxicity, highlighting their potential for advanced therapeutic applications. The precise polymers also reveal new design principles for polymer-based gene-delivery vectors, emphasizing the impact of structural precision.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene-delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene-delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability. Thus, precise control over the structures of gene-delivery polymers is extremely beneficial for property optimizations and manufacturing reproducibility. However, sequence-defined gene-delivery polymers with high efficiency and low toxicity are rare, limited by synthetic strategies. In this work, we developed a method that enables poly(&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino esters), one of the most promising gene-delivery polymers, to be synthesized with precisely controlled and vastly variable molecular weight, end group, and topology.

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Establishing an Efficient Electron Transfer System for P450 Enzyme OleP to Improve the Biosynthesis of Murideoxycholic Acid by Redox Partner Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic redox partner engineering strategy is proposed for three&#8208;component P450s, including selection, reconstitution, engineering, and analysis of the most suitable redox partner. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.








Abstract
The electron transfer from NAD(P)H to heme is a rate&#8208;limiting step in the redox partner&#8208;mediated catalysis of P450 enzyme. However, due to the lack of efficient engineering strategies, it is difficult to improve the properties of redox partner. Herein, we construct an effective approach to modify the redox partner for a typical P450 enzyme (OleP) that can catalyze the stereoselective conversion of lithocholic acid to murideoxycholic acid. First, the combination of computational modeling and experimental validation was performed to rapidly identify the most suitable redox partner (PetH/PetF). Next, the interactions between PetF and OleP were investigated and the engineering on PetF was conducted to enhance the efficiency of electron transfer. Using a novel microplate screening method, a superior mutant (PetFF64D) was efficiently selected, which exhibited a significant enhancement in MDCA conversion yield from 32.5% to 80.9% and total turnover number (TTN) from 406.2 to 1617.9. Finally, through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, the analysis of electron transfer pathway, and the calculations of electron transfer rate, the mechanism of electron transfer was investigated. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Post&#8208;Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Hard X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3 were achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. The assembled BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited excellent X&#8208;ray absorption capacity and high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity.








Abstract
The density properties of semiconductors play a crucial role in applications, such as radiation detection, electronic devices, and aerospace technologies. However, controlling the density of semiconductors often leads to significant alterations in their electronic structure, which can result in the loss of their original semiconductor properties. Perovskite semiconductors, known for their excellent carrier transport properties, face limitations in hard X&#8208;ray detection due to their relatively low density and loose atomic packing. This study explores a series of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3, achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. When applied to hard X&#8208;ray detection, the post&#8208;perovskite materials demonstrated superior attenuation cross&#8208;sections compared to the heaviest 3D CsPbI3 perovskite and 0D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite. Specifically, the BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited a high sensitivity of 4126&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a minimum detection limit of 4.3&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.

         <title>Nonmetallic High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Engineered Nanocarbons for Advanced ORR Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
B, F, P, S, and N co&#8208;doped high&#8208;entropy nanocarbon (HENC) is synthesized through ZIF&#8208;8 modification and pyrolysis. It exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, rivaling Pt/C, and notable stability. Simulations highlight synergistic heteroatom effects and entropy enhancement, with N, P, and S as crucial active sites. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, HENC achieves a peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2, surpassing Pt/C (542 mW cm&#8722;2), while maintaining durability. This study introduces a novel route for high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a nonmetal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.

In zinc&#8211;air batteries, HENC achieves a peak power density of 604 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing Pt/C (542 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while maintaining durability. This study introduces a novel route for high-performance, cost-effective catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept high-entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co-doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in situ polymerization modification of ZIF-8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a nonmetal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all-site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co-doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrating long-term stability over a 16-day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high-entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high-performance low-cost catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiazolium&#8208;Linked Crystalline Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Mixed Electronic&#8208;Ionic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs) were synthesized by a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach with well crystallinity, and high chemical stability, where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. Ionic thiazolium linkage endow these MEICOFs with recorded electronic (55.2 S m&#8722;1) and well ionic conductivity, thereby enabling ORR catalysis without additional conductive agent and the rotation of electrode.








Abstract
Developing efficiently mixed electronic&#8208;ionic (MEI) conductive microcosmic pathways within a single functional material is essential yet challenging for electronic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature pre&#8208;designed functionalities and uniform pores, making them highly desirable platforms for transporting electrons and ions. However, for MEI conductive COFs, achieving high crystallinity when incorporating high&#8208;density ionic groups within the extensively &#960;&#8208;electron delocalized skeletons remain a challenge due to intermolecular interactions. Herein, we reported a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach to synthesize new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs, M&#9552;Cu, Co, Fe), where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. MEICOFs demonstrated broad ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared absorption bands and narrow bandgaps. As a proof of concept, the mixed electronic and hydroxide ionic conductivity of CuEICOF was determined to be 55.2 and 0.01 S m&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of the electrode.

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;Petal Flower&#8208;Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm have been fabricated, which endow the strong SERS signal due to the chiral selective enhancement of localized electromagnetic fields. Thus, an ultrasensitive detection method for the early clinical detection of AD is presented.








Abstract
Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the d&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.

         <title>Hybrid Linking Sites Constructed Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Asymmetric Dimerized Giant Molecule Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with an Efficiency of &#8776;20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid linking site engineering was developed for the first time to construct nonfully conjugated asymmetric dimeric giant molecule acceptor (GMA) named 2Y&#8208;we, and the related organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.9%, which is the highest value in the reported non&#8208;fully conjugated GMAs to date.








Abstract
Linking&#8208;site engineering, used to graft two or more monomers, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series giant molecule acceptors (Y&#8208;GMAs). However, the reported Y&#8208;GMAs all use a single&#8208;typed linking site, making it difficult to finely&#8208;tune their optoelectronic properties. Herein, we develop a non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMA (named 2Y&#8208;we), with hybrid linking sites at the wing and end&#8208;group of monomers, to combine the respective advantages of the wing and end&#8208;group site linked counterparts. Compared to its parental monomer, 2Y&#8208;we shows different intermolecular interactions, crystallinity, packing, and glass transition temperature, allowing optimized active layer morphology (including appropriate phase separation and ordered molecular packing) and stability. Consequently, the D18/2Y&#8208;we&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) obtain an improved power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% with both higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high VOC&#160;&#215;&#160;JSC, 2Y&#8208;we is introduced into D18:L8&#8208;BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported nonfully conjugated Y&#8208;GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking&#8208;site engineering for constructing high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;GMAs offers an approach to boost device efficiency.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate pre&#8208;activation to address high C&#8211;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#8211;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method&#8217;s versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating a quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8208; with a lower &#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.</dc:description>

As a result, the fine-tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5-fold increase compared to MnCo2O4and up to 22-fold increase compared to the octahedrally-active only catalysts.

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation  on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolyte, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1, respectively. In&#8208;situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8208;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted esters with aryl bromides is established for the first time by employing P&#8208;chiral monophosphorus ligand 3&#8208;Pent&#8208;BIDIME as chiral ligand, leading to a series of enantioenriched &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl esters possessing quaternary carbon stereocenters in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivities. The method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and low Pd loadings (as low as 1 mol %). The synthetic power of this protocol is exemplified by efficient preparation of a chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl substituted &#947;&#8208;lactone and asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;amolanone. DFT calculation revealed a NaBr&#8208;bridged downstream transmetalation and the importance of noncovalent interaction in controlling the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweaving Covalent Organic Polymer Chains into Two&#8208;Dimensional Networks: Synthesis, Single Crystal Structure and Application for Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopic weaving has been proven to be the most enduring and effective method for manufacturing fabrics to meet the practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, the construction of molecular structures with exquisite topologies and specific properties based on molecular weaving is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed and fabricated a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) woven covalent organic polymer (COP) network (named as CityU&#8208;46) driven by the dative N&#8594;B bonds between the 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxa&#8208;borole)benzene (BACT) and 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (BPT). The complex woven topology of CityU&#8208;46 was determined using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, revealing that it features a well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over and two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. Due to its structural merits, CityU&#8208;46 can be used as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, significantly improving the stability and long&#8208;term performance of lithium metal cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;ring Intramolecular Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of these molecules often render their susceptibility to photodegradation. To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8208;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included into polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) for resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.62% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8208;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs, but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systematic design of organotin&#8208;oxo macrocycles with enhanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photon&#8208;harvesting capability and sub&#8208;50 nm lithographic resolution remains a pivotal challenge in advancing nanofabrication technologies. Herein, we present a novel series of polynuclear nbutyltin&#8208;oxygen macrocycles&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;constructed through selenite ligand&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly. Among these, Sn12&#8208;&#945; demonstrated exceptional electron beam lithography (EBL) performance, achieving a critical dimension resolution of 50 nm at a low dose of 50 &#956;C&#183;cm&#8208;2, attributed to its elevated Sn/Se content, compact molecular architecture (diameter, 1.5 nm), and excellent film&#8208;forming ability (surface roughness, 0.59 nm). By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8208;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8208;oxide photoresists through ligand&#8208;driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution patterning for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8208;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. While promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8208;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realise the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence Control in Sulfur&#8208;Containing Ring&#8208;Opening Co&#8208; and Terpolymerisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers uniquely expand the catalogue of accessible material properties compared to current commodity materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped. Combining sulfur&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing monomers in ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation leads to a reshuffling reaction of the sulfur centres, which has been challenging to control &#8212; a central task for reliably tailoring properties. However, very recent methodologies have emerged that not only suppress but also utilise this phenomenon to precisely access sulfur&#8208;containing polymer structures. These structures can exhibit improved degradability, chemical recyclability, refractive indices, and crystallinity compared to their all&#8208;oxygen analogues. Furthermore, underutilised and even entirely untapped monomer feedstocks can become accessible as a result. This mini&#8208;review aims to provide a roadmap of the tools currently available to selectively access sulfur&#8208;containing co&#8208; and terpolymer structures to enable emerging applications that leverage the chemistry of sulfur.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using NMR spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C&#8211;H bond in toluene by titanium dioxide&#8208;supported sub&#8208;nanometric PtO x  clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a sub&#8208;nanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75 &#956;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of ~170 &#956;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that sub&#8208;nanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue towards the activation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regio&#8208;Regular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric molecular engineering utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), while adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regio&#8208;regular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure, but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary Organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25% and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking, excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultra&#8208;low non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179 eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8208;solid Zn&#8208;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional catalysts often fail to address these challenges, exhibiting limited sulfur utilization and cycling stability under fast&#8208;charging conditions. To overcome this limitation, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8208;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. In contrast, utilizing low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. Consequently, the AZSBs with the HES catalysts deliver over 4,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1 with a capacity decay of 0.086% per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimisation Ag&#8230;</title>

         <dc:description>New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta&#160;(PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favourable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 x 50 mg/kg) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favourable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimisation approach.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;demand Ligate and Release Strategy based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labelling and delabelling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in&#8208;built release mechanism to restore their original state.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (~46%) and a significant |glum| ~ 3.6 &#215; 10&#8315;&#178;. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to the low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3 Wh kg&#8208;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50 &#176;C (166.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1) to &#8208;20 &#176;C (141.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188&#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21 eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93 V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of non-fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock-shaped giant molecule materials T-Qx based on high efficiency Qx-series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine-substituted giant molecule T-Qx-15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188&#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non-radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21 eV, which results in a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93 V. T-Qx-15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;-conjugated planar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers form sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#8722;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365 nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3 wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes towards High&#8208;voltage and High&#8208;loading Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt; 4 V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What&#8217;s more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in&#8208;situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20 oC to 60 oC. Specially, cells with 8.8 mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT calculations on b&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#8208;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. They also show that isolation of (BDI)Sr(m&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#713; dianion should be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the superbulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI* = HC[(Me)C=N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). A heterobimetallic approach enabled first N2 fixation with a Sr complex stabilized with a bulky bis&#8208;amide ligand DIPePNN: DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with K/KI gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); a similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#713; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae = Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to isolation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7) which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses towards low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.</dc:description>

The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA-D/ZrFA-D-Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF-syntheses towards low-cost, scale-up, and recyclable production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenacetin[3]arenes: Mannich&#8208;type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel NAm&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of readily available Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]) in yields up to 25.9%.&#160;Ph[3]&#160;exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with&#160;amide groups&#160;and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of the amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3&#160;and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8208;105&#160;M&#8208;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8208;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3&#160;to the F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims&#8212;amides and alkoxyl groups&#8212;facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, &#8230;</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#8211;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficiency utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develop atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400 nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picosecond. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#8211;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8208;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8208;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to non&#8208;halogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8208;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed the first family of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable pentafluorosulfanylation (SF&#8325;) reagents. Although the SF&#8325; group is a bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group (CF&#8323;)&#8212;exhibiting even greater electronegativity and lipophilicity, attributes that have earned it the nickname "super trifluoromethyl group"&#8212;the development of shelf&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle SF&#8325;&#8208;incorporating reagents had remained elusive for over 70 years since its discovery. Our discovery enables the synthesis of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;free fluorinated compounds, offering significant advantages over traditional CF&#8323; analogs. These new reagents exhibit promising reactivity under photochemical conditions, efficiently facilitating the formation of novel SF&#8325;&#8208;containing molecules. Moreover, our approach is compatible with the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293 nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 nm to 741 nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.</dc:description>

To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293 nm (in solar-blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar-blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide-range color-tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 nm to 741 nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar-blind UV ML materials and makes bright-field environment ML sensors possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. While this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via co&#8208;assembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. Firstly, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, Chiral co&#8208;assembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;assembly from Melt: The ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum, and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new non&#8208;chiral monomers, dimers and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex mesostructures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; &#160;in solutions, where the lack of inter&#8208;cluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach ~kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Negative Photochromism in Styryl Cyanines for Light&#8208;Modulated Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient photoswitches capable of complete conversion to their metastable isomer are not so common, yet highly desirable for applications in smart materials and devices. Here, we report the photochromic behavior of a series of styryl cyanine photoswitches, all demonstrating high switching efficiency, with some achieving full conversion to the metastable form. Despite structural similarities to spiropyran photoswitches, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of styryl cyanines is fundamentally different. Unlike classical photoswitches that rely on double&#8208;bond rotation, these molecules undergo substantial geometric changes via the formation of a spiro carbon. This transformation disrupts conjugation, causing a desirable blue shift in absorbance ideal for creating responsive materials and devices. We further show that the switching kinetics can be finely tuned through electronic effects of various substituents or the choice of surrounding medium. These photoswitches exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and can be easily shifted into the visible region via their acidochromic properties. Taking advantage of their high switching efficiency and affinity for acidic polymers, we finally propose their use as smart dopants to develop light&#8208;responsive materials with tunable proton transport properties under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a deaminative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling (SMC) of anilines with nitrate as a diazotization reagent, which integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with nitrate&#8208;based diazonium chemistry for the first time. The synergistic reduction of nitrate by bisulfite and boronic acids allows for both oxidative diazotization with low&#8208;valent transition metal redox transformations simultaneously. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. In comparison to previous diazonium&#8208;based Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;couplings, the in&#8208;situ oxidation of anilines by reduction of nitrate allows larger functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diastereoselective construction of organic scaffolds from simple and commercial materials is a powerful strategy in contemporary organic synthesis. Herein, we report a novel disconnection for the direct preparation of tetrahydrofurans (THF) and corresponding derivatives from acyl chlorides and alkenes using charge relocation. Newly synthesised Hantzsch ester derivatives, functioning both as hydride sources and selectivity modulators, enabled exceptional diastereoselectivity. The wide range of alkenes tolerated is a highlight of the method, enabling the construction of structurally distinct THF&#8208;containing skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysine&#8208;targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins&#160;in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads, herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8208;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7 which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA) identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8208;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8208;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor) which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C=O, C=N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11000 h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3 mA cm&#8208;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine learning&#8208;augmented molecular dynamics simulations (MD) reveal insights into the disconnect between affinity and activation of ZTP riboswitch ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenge of targeting RNA with small molecules necessitates a better understanding of RNA&#8208;ligand interaction mechanisms. However, the dynamic nature of nucleic acids,
their ligand&#8208;induced stabilization, and how conformational changes influence gene expression pose significant difficulties for experimental investigation. This work employs a combination of computational and experimental methods to address these challenges. By integrating structure&#8208;informed design, crystallography, and machine learning&#8208;augmented all&#160;atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD) we synthesized, biophysically and biochemically characterized, and studied the dissociation of a library of small molecule activators of the ZTP riboswitch, a ligand&#8208;binding RNA motif that regulates bacterial gene expression. We uncovered key interaction mechanisms, revealing valuable insights into the role of ligand binding kinetics on riboswitch activation. Further, we established that ligand on&#8208;rates determine activation potency as opposed to binding affinity and elucidated RNA structural differences, which provide mechanistic insights into the interplay of RNA structure on riboswitch activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA transfection efficiency In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Structures for Enhanced Durability and Efficiency in Zinc&#8208;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are among the most appealing technologies for large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, safety and sustainability. However, their long&#8208;term durability is challenged by issues like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendritic zinc electroplating. Herein, we address these challenges by reshaping the Zn2+ ion solvation structures in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) aqueous electrolytes using a robust hydrogen bond acceptor as a co&#8208;solvent additive. Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn2+ solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilisation during the Zn0 electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance, viscosity and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn2+ reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn0/2+ cycling in aqueous electrolytes without H2 evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high&#8208;performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Organocatalysis with Bidentate Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the employment of &#8221;non&#8208;classical&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions like halogen bonding (XB) in asymmetric catalysis is still at a very early stage, there are significant challenges to overcome. In some reported cases, the relevance of halogen bonding to the catalytic action is unclear, while in others, catalyst activity is limited. Herein, we present the second generation of a bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bond donor as a modifiable and highly active chiral halogen bonding catalyst. With these modified derivatives, high stereocontrol of up to 98% ee could be achieved in a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction for a range of different substrates. Importantly, the crucial role of halogen bonding in this catalytic process was demonstrated by the low performance of the non&#8208;iodinated variants and by DFT calculations. The latter also indicate that the stereoinduction is based on the imposed orientation of the substrates towards each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Chirality and Vibrational Optical Activity in an Ionic&#8208;Liquid Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]&#8208; are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra.
The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide.
Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl&#8208;sulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion.
This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one.
Altogether this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.</dc:description>

         <title>Photodriven Aquatic Locomotion in Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Composites with Tunable Wettability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or&#160;superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol&#8208;functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites, allowing photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity. By combining tunable wettability with robust photothermal performance, these MXene&#8208;LCE composites open new opportunities for designing and integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in aquatic actuation systems.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nanographenes Through Domino Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups. The structures of these nanographenes and other cyclized products were unambiguously elucidated by using scanning tunneling microscopy directly on Au(111). Moreover, their electronic properties were investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Our findings offer new insights into the on&#8208;surface cyclization reactions, providing an effective strategy for synthesizing a wider variety of carbon nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous improvement of mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healability of elastomers enabled by F&#8211;H&#8208;bond&#8208;based nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are often trade&#8208;offs among high mechanical strength, high toughness, and efficient self&#8208;healing. Herein, we present a biomimetic strategy utilizing F&#8211;H bonds for nanoconfinement to achieve the simultaneous enhancement of these conflicting properties. The mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healing efficiency of a fluorinated crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) (CPUU&#8208;FA) elastomer are improved 1.3&#8208;, 1.5&#8208;, and 1.2&#8208;fold, respectively, compared with those of its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart. Notably, the CPUU&#8208;FA has the highest recorded puncture energy (887 mJ) among polymeric elastomers and the highest fracture energy (117 kJ m&#8211;2) among reported thermoset elastomers. Moreover, it exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency (99%), remarkable reprocessability, and a low surface energy (56 MJ m&#8211;2). The application of self&#8208;healing elastomers in the fabrication of soft electronics is further demonstrated. The molecular design strategy is anticipated to inspire new developments in high&#8208;performance materials for cutting&#8208;edge applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Position Effects of Monoatom Doping in Silver Nanoclusters on Oxygen Reduction by Single Entity Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) with monoatom doping represent an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performances due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant and host atoms. However, in&#8208;depth understanding the position effects of monoatom doping within alloying NCs, particularly at the atomic level, remains elusive. Here, we employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of individual monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M= Ag, Au, Pt, Cu) NCs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By relying on high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput electrochemical measurements, we successfully discriminated the effects of monoatom variation in M1Ag24 NCs on ORR activity at the single atom resolution and identified different M1Ag24 NCs across characteristic populations. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with intracluster migration of Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 NCs. This work demonstrates a novel approach for in situ indentifying the position effects of foreign doping atoms on the electrocatalytic activity of alloy NCs at the single atom level.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Electrocyclization Assembles 2,2&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran in Fungal Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pericyclic reactions, such as cycloaddition and electrocyclization, are among the most useful approaches for constructing complex natural products with diverse biological activities. While enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been increasingly reported in recent years, there are only few examples of enzyme&#8208;mediated electrocyclization reactions. The 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring plays a significant role in constituting many bioactive fungal and plant natural products. In this study, we characterize the vsc biosynthetic gene cluster of the DMP&#8208;containing natural product versicamide A (1) in Aspergillus versicolor DL0022. The biosynthetic route for DMP formation and biochemical functions of the involved enzymes are fully elucidated. Specifically, we reveal that the berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase VscB mediates a crucial oxidative process, followed by an electrocyclization to form a C&#8722;O bridge bond, thereby affording the key DMP ring. Structural simulation, molecular modeling, mutational analysis, and quantum chemical calculations elucidate the oxidative electrocyclization mechanism. The FAD cofactor of VscB/NotD' facilitates hydride abstraction at the C25 position of the substrate, while the key amino acid residue E529 acts as a general base to deprotonate the C6 hydroxyl group.</dc:description>
