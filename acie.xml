         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein as a Target for Metallo&#8208;Anti&#8208;Neurodegenerative Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. We show that the low&#8208;toxic Ru(III) complex trans&#8208;[ImH][RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)] (NAMI&#8208;A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre&#8208;formed fibrils. NAMI&#8208;A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;&#8208;syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI&#8208;A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro&#8208;drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI&#8208;A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;&#8208;syn&#8208;induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Macro/Microporous Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Toxic Pollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In case of pollutant segregation fast mass diffusion is a fundamental criterion in order to achieve improved performance. The rapid mass transport through porous materials can be achieved by availing large open pores followed by easy and complete accessibility of functional sites. Inducing macroporosity into such materials could serve as ideal solution providing access to large macropores that offer unhindered transport of analyte and full exposure to interactive sites. Moreover, the challenge to configure the ionic&#8208;functionality with macroporosity could emerge as an unparalleled avenue toward pollutants separation. Herein, we strategized a synthetic protocol for construction of a positively charged hierarchically&#8208;porous ordered interconnected macro&#8208;structure of organic framework where the size and number of macropores can easily be tuned. The ordered macropores with strong electrostatic interaction synergistically exhibited ultrafast removal efficiency toward various toxic pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>An Amorphous n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Ultra&#8208;Rigid Planar Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High charge carrier mobility polymer semiconductors are always semi&#8208;crystalline. Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. Here we report the first near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with decent electron mobility, which features remarkably rigid, straight and planar polymer backbone. The molecular design strategy is to copolymerize two fused&#8208;ring building blocks which are both electron&#8208;accepting, centrosymmetrical and planar. The polymer is the alternating copolymer of double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and benzobisthiazole (BBTz) unit. It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and high molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfectly Encoding &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anions in the RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE = Y, Yb, Lu) Family with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Balanced Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, which simultaneously possess strong second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and desired optical anisotropy, is a core optical material accessible to the modern optoelectronics. Accompanied by strong SHG effect in a NLO crystal, a contradictory problem of overlarge birefringence is ignored, leading to low frequency doubling efficiency and poor beam quality. Herein, a series of rare earth cyanurates RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE = Y, Yb, Lu) were successfully characterized by 3D electron diffraction technique. Based on a "three birds with one stone" strategy, they enable the simultaneous fulfillment of strong SHG responses (2.5 &#8208; 4.2 &#215; KH2PO4), short UV cutoff (ca. 220 nm) and applicable birefringence (ca. 0.15 at 800 nm) by the introduction of rare earth coordination control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C3N3O3)3&#8211; anions. These findings provide high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wavelength NLO materials and highlight the exploration of cyanurates as a new research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Tolane&#8208;Perfluorotolane Assembly as Supramolecular Base Pair Replacement in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions offer outstanding possi&#173;bilities for engineering of supramolecular systems, including nucleic acids. Here, we implement the tolane&#8208;perfluorotolane interaction as base pair replacement in DNA. Tolane (THH) and perfluorotolane (TFF) moieties were connected to acyclic backbone units, comprising glycol nucleic acid (GNA) or butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) building blocks, that were incorporated via phosphoramidite chemistry at opposite positions in a DNA duplex. Thermodynamic analyses by UV thermal melting revealed a compelling stabilization by THH/TFF heteropairs only when connected to the BuNA backbone, but not with the shorter GNA linker. Detailed NMR studies confirmed the preference of the BuNA backbone for enhanced polar &#960;&#8208;stacking. This work defines how orthogonal supramolecular interactions can be tailored by small constitutional changes in the DNA backbone, and it inspires future studies of arene&#8208;fluoroarene&#8208;programmed assembly of DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Magnesium and Calcium Hydrides: Transforming CO into Unsaturated Disilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of two isostructural anionic magnesium and calcium complexes is reported. By X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction techniques, the anionic hydrides are shown to exist as dimers, held together by a range of interactions between the two anions and two bridging potassium cations. Unlike the vast proportion of previously reported dimeric group 2 hydrides, which have hydrides that bridge two group 2 centres, here the hydrides are shown to be &#8216;terminal&#8217;, but stabilised by interactions with the potassium cations. Both anionic hydrides were found to insert and couple CO under mild reaction conditions to give the corresponding group 2 cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes. These cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes were found to undergo salt elimination reactions with silyl chlorides, allowing access to small unsaturated disilyl ethers with a high percentage of their mass originating from the C1 source CO.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrenes and nitrenoids are highly reactive species and the proposed key intermediates in nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compound synthesis. In this work, we developed a practical method for the synthesis of phenanthridines by the reaction of oxime and Grignard reagents (with or without diethylzinc) via ring&#8208;expansion of magnesium coordinated nitrenoid complex as the key step. The method has been used to synthesize optically active planar chiral ferrocenyl phenanthridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;reservoir hydrogel electrolyte for long&#8208;term cycling Zn/PANI batteries in wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced aqueous batteries are promising for next generation flexible and wearable devices owing to the high safety, yet still requiring better cycling stability and high specific capacity in wide temperature range. Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3 M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. The &#8208;SO3&#8208;H+ function group in PAGE can endow the Zn/PANI battery with following merits: firstly, accelerating the redox reaction kinetics for PANI by constant proton generation; secondly, increasing the specific capacity by boosting the reaction sites between ions and PANI functional groups; thirdly, suppressing the side reaction and dendrites by inducing the (002) crystal plane formation. In addition, the anti&#8208;freezing performance for the hydrogel is also optimized by the salt and hydrogel, with a high ionic conductivity of 14.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at &#8208;35oC. As a consequence, even at &#8208;35oC, the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1,500 h under 2 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 79.6 mA h g&#8208;1 for more than 70,000 cycles at 15 A g&#8208;1. This proton&#8208;supplying strategy by polymeric acid hydrogel may further propel the development of high performance aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;area Free&#8208;standing Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Films by Liquid&#8208;air Interfacial Polymerization for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing large&#8208;area free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) films is of vital importance for their applications but&#160;is still a&#160;big&#160;challenge. Herein, we reported the synthesis of large metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films and their applications for oxygen electrocatalysis. The reaction of&#160;meso&#8208;benzohydrazide&#8208;substituted metal porphyrins with tris&#8208;aldehyde linkers afforded free&#8208;standing COF films at the liquid&#8208;air interface. These films can be scaled up to 3000 cm2area and display great mechanical stability and structural integrity. Importantly, the Co&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based films are efficient for electrocatalytic O2&#160;reduction and evolution reactions.&#160;A flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled using the films and showed high&#160;performance with a charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap of 0.88 V at 1 mA/cm2&#160;and high stability under bent conditions (0&#176;&#160;to 180&#176;). This work thus presents a strategy to synthesize&#160;functionalized&#160;COF&#160;films&#160;with&#160;high quality for uses in flexible electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Proteins with Base&#8208;labile Posttranslational Modifications Enabled by a Boc&#8208;SPPS Based General Strategy Towards Peptide C&#8208;terminal Salicylaldehyde Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) is a challenging task; for instance,  O  &#8208;acetylation and  S  &#8208;palmitoylation PTMs that cannot survive Fmoc removal conditions during Fmoc&#8208;solid phase peptide synthesis. In this work, we developed a new Boc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) esters, which are the key reaction partners in Ser/Thr ligation and Cys/Pen ligation. The strategy utilized the semicarbazone&#8208;modified AM&#160;(aminomethyl) resin, which could support the Boc&#8208;SPPS and release the peptide SAL ester upon treatment with TFA/H  2  O and pyruvic acid. The non&#8208;oxidative aldehyde regeneration was fully compatible with all the canonical amino acids. Armed with this strategy, we finished the syntheses of the  O  &#8208;acetylated protein histone H3(S10ac, T22ac) and the hydrophobic  S  &#8208;palmitoylated peptide derived from caveolin&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Artificial enzymes utilizing the genetically encoded non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) as catalytic residue are able to react with carbonyl compounds through an iminium ion mechanism, realising reactions that have no equivalent in nature. Here, we report an in vivo biocatalytic cascade that is augmented with such an artificial enzyme catalyzed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme in this study is a pAF containing evolved variant of the Lactococcal multidrug resistance Regulator, designated LmrR_V15pAF_RMH, which efficiently converts in vivo produced benzaldehyde derivatives into the corresponding hydrazone products inside E. coli cells. These in vivo biocatalytic cascades comprising an artificial enzyme catalysed reactions are an important step towards achieving a hybrid metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Selecting Better Biocatalysts by Complementing Recoded Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vivo selections are powerful tools for the directed evolution of enzymes. However, the need to link enzymatic activity to cellular survival makes selections for enzymes that do not fulfill a metabolic function challenging. Here, we present an in vivo selection strategy that leverages recoded organisms addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to evolve biocatalysts that can provide these building blocks from synthetic precursors. We exemplify our platform by engineering carbamoylases that display catalytic efficiencies more than five orders of magnitude higher than those observed for the wild&#8208;type enzyme for ncAA&#8208;precursors. As growth rates of bacteria under selective conditions correlate with enzymatic activities, we were able to elicit improved variants from populations by performing serial passaging. By requiring minimal human intervention and no specialized equipment, we surmise that our strategy will become a versatile tool for the in vivo directed evolution of diverse biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiaromatic Sapphyrin Isomer: Transformation into Contracted Porphyrinoids with Variable Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sapphyrin is a pentapyrrolic expanded porphyrin with a 22&#960; aromatic character. Herein, we report the synthesis of a 20&#960; antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer  1  by oxidative cyclization of a pentapyrrane precursor  P5  with a terminal &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole. The resulting isomer  1  , containing a mis&#8208;linked bipyrrole unit in the skeleton, exhibits a reactivity for further oxidation due to the distinct antiaromatic electronic structure, affording a fused macrocycle  2, possessing a spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing [5.6.5.6]&#8208;tetracyclic structure. Subsequent treatment with an acid afforded a weakly aromatic pyrrolone&#8208;appended N&#8208;confused corrole  3, and thermal fusion gave a [5.6.5.7]&#8208;tetracyclic&#8208;ring&#8208;embedded 14&#960; aromatic triphyrin(2.1.1) analog  4. The cyclization at the mis&#8208;linked pyrrole moiety of  P5  played a crucial role in synthesizing the antiaromatic porphyrinoid susceptible to facile transformation to novel porphyrinoids with variable aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Arylalkenes with Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes with Lewis basic amines is of great interest and importance but remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we developed a Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of arylalkenes directly using commercially accessible secondary amines. This process enables the efficient access to valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with arylalkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated electrophilic cationic alkylcobalt(IV) species and free amines. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy not only provides a straightforward and alternative approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, but also underpins the substantial opportunities in developing asymmetric radical functionalization of alkenes with various free nucleophiles in oxidative MHAT catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Proton Transfer on Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Manganese Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of proton transfer on water oxidation has hardly been measurably established in heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, two isomorphous manganese phosphates (NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O and KMnPO4&#183;H2O) were designed to form an ideal platform to study the effect of proton transfer on water oxidation. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O has been proven to be solely responsible for its better activity. The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the Mn(III)&#8208;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth&#8208;order in [H+] for OER. Thus, proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulating Metal Nanoparticles into a Layered Zeolite Precursor with Surface Silanol Nests Enhances Sintering Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal nanoparticles are used as heterogeneous catalysts but often deactivated due to sintering at high temperatures. Confining metal species into a porous matrix reduces sintering, yet supports rarely provide additional stabilization. Here, we used the silanol&#8208;rich layered zeolite IPC&#8208;1P to stabilize ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. By adjusting the IPC&#8208;1P interlayer space through swelling, we prepared various architectures, including microporous and disordered mesoporous. In&#8208;situ scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that Rh nanoparticles are resistant to sintering at high temperature (750 oC, 6hrs). Rh clusters strongly bind to surface silanol quadruplets at IPC&#8208;1P layers by hydrogen transfer to clusters, while high silanol density hinders their migration based on density functional theory calculations. Ultimately, combining swelling with long&#8208;chain surfactant and utilizing metal&#8208;silanol interactions resulted in a novel, catalytically active material &#8208; Rh@IPC_C22.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) Complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mixed Na/CoII tris(amido) base enables the selective cobaltation of a range of fluoroarenes furnishing a new family of square planar tetra(aryl) complexes. Mechanistic investigations shed light on the key roles played by each metal, uncovering two alternative types of bimetallic cooperation for the metalation step, which is then followed by a fast ligand rearrangement driven by the coordination preference of the alkali&#8208;metal.







Abstract
While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8722;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)2 [HMDS=N(SiMe3)2] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na2CoAr4] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8722;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)2Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na2CoAr4] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)2 and [NaCo(HMDS)3].

         <title>Pyrogallate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with a Two&#8208;Dimensional Secondary Building Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvothermal reaction of 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl with Fe2+ generates a MOF with an unusual topology, comprising 2D secondary building units of mixed&#8208;valence Fe2+/Fe3+ sites, which enable strong electronic interactions.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a rare two&#8208;dimensional (2D) secondary building unit (SBU).

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cyclisation Reaction for the Synthesis of Highly&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines and Quinolines.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensation of 2&#8208;vinylanilines and conjugated aldehydes followed by an efficient light&#8208;mediated cyclisation selectively yields either substituted tetrahydroquinolines with typically high dr, or in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst the synthesis of quinoline derivatives is demonstrated. These atom economical processes require mild conditions, with the substrate scope demonstrating excellent site selectivity and functional group tolerance, including azaarene&#8208;bearing substrates. A thorough experimental mechanistic investigation explores multiple pathways and the key role that imine and iminium intermediates play in the absorption of visible light to generate reactive excited states. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated on gram scale quantities in both batch and flow, alongside further manipulation of the medicinally relevant products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aldehydes installation by radical formylation constitutes an attractive synthetic strategy. However, the generation of formyl radicals for organic synthesis applications remains unknown. Herein we report the first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides, which selectively synthesize aldehydes by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. The aldehydes can be installed on acrylates, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl ketones, and complex steroids by radical hydroformylation in excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. The concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals is established by experimental and computational approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Transport Properties in Interconnected Enargite&#8208;Stannite Type Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A particular biphasic compound, which consists of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type tetrahedral frameworks at a nanoscale, has been synthesized. The complex crystal chemistry of such nanocomposites rises the issue of the role of the two structures and of their interfaces in the mechanism governing their electrical and thermal conductivities.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms that connect heat and electron transport with crystal structures and defect chemistry is fundamental to develop materials with thermoelectric properties. In this work, we synthesized a series of self&#8208;doped compounds Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 through Cu for Mn substitution. Using a combination of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and precession&#8208;assisted electron diffraction tomography, we evidence that the materials are composed of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type structures, via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. By combining experiments with ab initio electron and phonon calculations, we discuss the structure&#8211;thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. We demonstrate that excess Cu+ substituted for Mn2+ dopes holes into the top of the valence band, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit ZT.

         <title>Dithiol&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Endoplasmic Re&#8208;ticulum&#8208;Targeted Synergistic Chemophototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled intracellular release of nitrite is still an unmet challenge due to the lack of bio&#8208;friendly donors, and the antitumor effect of nitrite is limited by its physiologically inert activity. Herein, we designed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic nitrite donors that are stable against bio&#8208;relevant species but selectively respond to dithiol species through S  N  Ar/intramolecular cyclization tandem reactions in the aqueous media, thanks to the strong electron donating nature of benzothiadiazole heterocycle and intramolecular nitro&#8722;thiol hydrogen bonding. The bioorthogonal click and release system was established to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cancer HepG2 cells. The intracellular prodrug activation was achieved by exogenous &#946;&#8208;galactosamine&#8208;modified dithiols, which led to production of fluorogenic photosensitizer and release of nitrite and nonivamide (a TRPV1 agonist). The nitrite and nonivamide were coupled to induce elevation of intracellular levels of calcium ions as well as reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) (e.g., nitric oxide and superoxide ion which were interactive to produce highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite), which resulted in ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrated that a combination of photoactivation and &#8220;click and release&#8221; strategy could enhance antitumor effect and is promising for cancer precision therapy.</dc:description>

Densely functionalized chiral allyl species, with an alkenyl CF3 group, were prepared with excellent selectivity by selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of allylboronic acids. The method can be used to access chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr compounds.







Abstract
We report herein a new method for the synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF3 functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF3 allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, based on the formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.

         <dc:description>
Uncovering Ion Adsorption Reactions. The combination of surface&#8208;sensitive v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments allows to uncover the interplay of a dominant fluoride and a weak calcium adsorption reaction at the fluorite&#8208;water interface. This is enabled by systematically changing bulk concentrations and suppression of fluoride dissolution.

The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.

         <title>A Pyridine&#8208;Stabilized N&#8208;Phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboravinyl Cation: Boron Analogue of Vinyl Cation</title>

         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;diboravinyl cation was obtained through the displacement reaction of the bromide substituent on a diborene derivative using pyridine. This newly formed species was shown to be a boron analogue of the vinyl cation which could be used for the activation of small molecules.







Abstract
A boron analogue of vinyl cation, pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboravinyl cation 2+, was synthesized by displacement of bromide in diborene 1 with excess pyridine. Experimental and computational studies showed that the positive charge is mainly at the B&#8722;B skeleton with delocalization to the pyridine ligand. One of the main modes of reactivity is through the B=B double bond alongside activation of the pyridine substituent, where the Bpyridine center is the predominant nucleophilic center and the predominant electrophilic center is either the activated pyridine para position or the BNHC center, illustrating the presence of diborene cation A, borylene&#8208;borenium cation B and diborene&#8208;pyridinium cation C resonance structures in cation 2+.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilicity&#8208;based triple&#8208;code site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (S&#8208;T&#8208;Q) was applied to the wild&#8208;type enzyme RgDAAO, leading to a mutant Zn7 with greater than 2000&#8208;fold improvement in specific activity toward the unnatural substrate D&#8208;glufosinate, which was converted into PPO, a precursor of an excellent herbicide, L&#8208;PPT. Computational analysis revealed that the higher activity was mainly caused by an extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity.







Abstract
Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it very easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the low activity of the wild&#8208;type enzyme toward unnatural substrates, such as D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT), restricts its application. In this study, DAAO from Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinct catalytic properties toward hydrophilic substrates as compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation suggest that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provides a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.

         <title>Ynamide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Bond Formation: Mechanistic Study and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynamide coupling reagents combine the advantages of conventional active esters and coupling reagents, while overcoming their disadvantages, and exhibit superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue. The applicability of ynamide coupling reagents has been successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis on the basis of a systematic mechanistic study.







Abstract
Ynamides, a class of novel coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, facilitated peptide bond formation in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step manner with &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide active esters of amino acids as stable intermediates. Ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide synthesis proceeded by a reaction mechanism that is completely different from that of conventional coupling reagents and exhibited superiority in addressing the issue of racemization/epimerization during peptide bond formation. Herein, we present a systematic mechanistic analysis, including kinetics and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type structure&#8211;reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations, providing unprecedented mechanistic insight into ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation. Based on these mechanistic studies, significant improvements were made, and the applicability of ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation was successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type amphiphilic supramolecular megamer is presented. It exhibits an unprecedented hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process in aqueous solution. The self&#8208;assembled structures formed by the megamer evolve from vesicles to vesosomes and eventually to a peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tubes as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside it as the peas.







Abstract
This study presents interesting self&#8208;assembly of peapod&#8208;like micrometer tubes from a planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type supramolecular megamer, which was constructed through the specific host&#8211;guest molecular recognition between azobenzene (AZO)&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly(ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol)&#8208;star&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (HSP&#8208;AZO) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;based hydrophilic hyperbranched polyglycerol (CD&#8208;g&#8208;HPG). A peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tube as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside as the peas was formed through sequential vesicle entosis, linear association, and fusion processes. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations support the structural possibility of the supramolecular peapod formation and its mechanism. UV light irradiation could lead to the disassembly of the peapod&#8208;like structure. This study expands the family of supramolecular polymers and opens a new avenue to develop bioinspired complex hierarchical nanoarchitectures at the microscopic level.

         <title>Amorphous Aluminosilicate Nanosheets as Universal Precursors for the Synthesis of Diverse Zeolite Nanosheets for Polymer&#8208;Cracking Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method allows zeolite nanosheets (NSs) to be prepared from single&#8208;species amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs). The AAS&#8208;NSs were prepared by the two&#8208;dimensional reactor in amphiphilic phases (TRAP) method. Using this approach four zeolite types were prepared from single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs by the dry gel conversion (DGC) process with structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs).







Abstract
Zeolites catalyze some reactions in their molecular&#8208;sized pores, but large molecules can react only on their external surface. Zeolite&#8208;nanosheets (NSs) have been developed as catalysts for large molecules. The previously reported methods to synthesize zeolite&#8208;NSs are specialized for each zeolite type. Here we propose a new method to synthesize various zeolite&#8208;NSs from the same amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs) as a universal precursor. We successfully synthesized the unprecedented AAS&#8208;NSs in the hydrophilic space of the stable hyperswollen lyotropic lamellar (HL) phase. The four zeolite types could be obtained from the single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs. These results imply that this method enables us to synthesize almost all types of zeolite&#8208;NSs. Moreover, the synthesized CHA&#8208;NSs have great potential for various applications because of their thickness and large external surface area.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Properties of Cryptophazane&#8212;A Soluble and Functionalizable C1&#8208;Symmetrical Cryptophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophanes are molecular hosts of particular interest for the development of biosensors based on xenon magnetic resonance imaging as they bind xenon reversibly. To prepare such a biosensor, a reactive site on the cryptophane core, which is desirable for such applications but synthetically challenging, has now been introduced by replacing a crown methylene bridge by a nitrogen atom to form a cryptophazane.







Abstract
The first example of a cryptophazane, a cryptophane functionalized with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the methylene bridges, is obtained with a 28&#8201;% overall yield over 8 steps, through the preparation of a C1&#8208;symmetrical aza&#8208;cyclotriveratrylene (aza&#8208;CTV). Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of a nitrogen atom on this part of the cryptophane core enhances the solubility in organic media of both the cryptophane and the synthetic intermediates, while presenting the same conformation as known cryptophanes. Cryptophazane was prepared on a multigram scale and easily functionalized. We also investigated its ability to encapsulate xenon atoms using hyperpolarized 129Xe (HP 129Xe) NMR spectroscopy. We found that both its affinity and exchange kinetics were in the appropriate range for applications in 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combined with the wide range of possible functionalization, this makes cryptophazane an excellent candidate for targeted HP 129Xe MRI.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.

         <title>Full Control of the Chiral Overpass Effect in Helical Polymers: P/M Screw Sense Induction by Remote Chiral Centers After Bypassing the First Chiral Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical sense induction in polymers is usually commanded by the chiral residue directly attached to the polymer backbone. In this work, it is demonstrated that either a P or M helical sense can be induced into a poly(phenylacetylene) by activation of a chiral overpass effect followed by selective manipulation of the conformational composition at a remote chiral center.







Abstract
In helical polymers, helical sense induction is usually commanded by teleinduction mechanism, where the largest substituent of the chiral residue directly attached to the main chain is the one that commands the helical sense. In this work, different helical structures with different helical senses are induced in a helical polymer [poly&#8208;(phenylacetylene)] when the conformational composition of two different dihedral angles of a pendant group with more than two chiral residues is tamed. Thus, while the dihedral angle at chiral residue 1 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;alanine], attached to the backbone, produces an extended or bent conformation in the pendant resulting in two scaffolds with different stretching degree, the second dihedral angle at chiral residue 2 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methoxyphenylacetamide] places the substituents of this chiral center in a different spatial orientation, originating opposite helical senses at the polymer that are induced through a total control of the &#8220;chiral overpass effect&#8221;.

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling multiphase coacervate droplets to a chemical reaction cycle allows access to regimes inside the phase diagram not possible under thermodynamic control. Control over the stability, liquidity, and localization of the multiphases makes it a great synthetic platform to study the organization of membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers with Single&#8208;Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites, and monolayer characteristic of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction catalysts can decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The experimental and density functional theory simulation show that the relative position and local coordination environment have a significant effect on the cooperation between the metal centers.







Abstract
Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts because there is not a practical way to decouple the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19&#8197;s&#8722;1 was achieved at the overpotential of 500&#8197;mV.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms. This oligo&#8208;A&#8208;based surface chemistry engineering method will enable controllable diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the nanoscopic surface to develop single&#8208;nanoparticle plasmonic devices for extreme nanophotonics and polariton chemistry.







Abstract
Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#177;3.6&#176; to 125.3&#177;8.0&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme Substrate Scope Complementarity for Promiscuous Cascade Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades can be used for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. A substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach was implemented to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase and a decarboxylase. The matched substrate scope of the enzymes was leveraged to produce a variety of enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are uniquely powerful for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. However, high substrate specificity can hinder the scope of biocatalytic cascades because the constituent enzymes may have non&#8208;complementary activity. In this study, we implemented a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase (ObiH) and a decarboxylase for the production of chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. To generate a promiscuous cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on &#946;&#8208;OH amino acids while avoiding activity on l&#8208;threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leveraged this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scope to produce a variety of enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This demonstration shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C&#8722;C bond forming cascades.

         <title>An Unsaturated Bond Strategy to Regulate Active Centers of Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to modulate the charge distribution of active centers of organic catalysts by using unsaturated bonds (UBs) is reported. The UBs can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N group as active centers. The effect of UBs decoration on adsorption property of the catalysts is disclosed.







Abstract
Unsaturated environment is the key to affect catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unveiling the effect of unsaturated sites toward ORR activity is of importance due to the vague unsaturated states. Reported here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy on the evaluation of unsaturated bonds (UBs) on adjacent carbon environment by precisely developing two metal&#8208;free vinyl&#8208;/azo&#8208;decorated covalent organic frameworks (Vinyl&#8208;COF and Azo&#8208;COF) as catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared UB&#8208;COFs exhibit good performance than the control Py&#8208;COF and comparable to the most reported carbon catalysts. Supported by theory calculations and in situ Raman spectra&#8208;electrochemistry, it is revealed that the UBs in organic catalysts can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N groups as active centers. Importantly, the intrinsic UBs can induce local charge redistribution, and make the molecular skeleton possess high isosurface map distribution, with an efficient affinity for oxygen intermediates.

         <title>19F Barcoding Enables Multiplex Detection of Biomarkers Associated with Organ Injury and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of molecular sensors with 19F barcodes enables multiplex detection of different biomarkers associated with organ injury and cancer. The barcoding strategy takes the advantage of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output and multiplex capacity.







Abstract
Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in complex environments is critical for the in&#8208;depth exploration of different biological processes, which is challenging for many current analytical methods due to various limitations. Herein, we report a strategy of 19F barcoding which takes the advantages of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output, and multiplex capacity. A set of 19F&#8208;barcoded sensors responding to different biomarkers involved in organ injury and cancer are designed, synthesized, and characterized. With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug&#8208;induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.

With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug-induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Algorithmic Explorations of Unimolecular and Bimolecular Reaction Spaces
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;low cost reaction exploration algorithm (Yet Another Reaction Program, v2.0) is used to predict reaction outcomes and characterize multiple unimolecular and bimolecular reaction networks. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.







Abstract
Algorithmic reaction exploration based on transition state searches has already made inroads into many niche applications, but its potential as a general&#8208;purpose tool is still largely unrealized. Computational cost and the absence of benchmark problems involving larger molecules remain obstacles to further progress. Here an ultra&#8208;low cost exploration algorithm is implemented and used to explore the reactivity of unimolecular and bimolecular reactants, comprising a total of 581 reactions involving 51 distinct reactants. The algorithm discovers all established reaction pathways, where such comparisons are possible, while also revealing a much richer reactivity landscape, including lower barrier reaction pathways and a strong dependence of reaction conformation in the apparent barriers of the reported reactions. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy of hydrated proton complexes in solution provides compelling evidence of the pronounced impact on the electronic structure of the water molecules participating in the hydration, with a hierarchy in coupling strengths of the proton with profoundly strong orbital interactions for the inner three water molecules, and Coulombic field effects of the proton positive charge with the first hydration shell water molecules.







Abstract
Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital&#8208;specific markers that distinguish two main electronic&#8208;structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital&#8208;energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.

The methods were effective in the alkylation of both 3&#8208;alkynoic acids, 2,3&#8208;alkendioic acids substrates with a broad range of heterocyclic and functionalized alkyl group substituents.

         <title>Tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane: An Isolable, Halogen&#8208;Free, Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottleable, halogen&#8208;free, neutral, single&#8208;site Lewis superacid, tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3) is synthesized in one pot from commercially available materials and its properties investigated. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane along with its lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO induces the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond functionalizations indicate that BoCb3 is a promising Lewis acid catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane and lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that BoCb3 is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].

         <title>Cooperative Catalyst&#8208;Enabled Regio&#8208; and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Aldimine Esters with Racemic Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of aldimine esters with racemic allylic alcohols was enabled by cooperative catalysis. The Et3B additive plays a significant role in ionizing allylic alcohols to form electrophilic metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species and simultaneously promotes the formation of nucleophilic Cu&#8208;ylides. Computational mechanistic studies revealed the role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities.







Abstract
We describe cooperative bimetallic catalysis that enables regio&#8208;/stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylations of aldimine esters. By employing Et3B as the key activator, racemic allylic alcohols can be directly ionized to form Pd or Ir&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species in the presence of achiral Pd or chiral Ir complexes, respectively. The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species are amenable to nucleophilic attack by the chiral Cu&#8208;azomethine ylide, the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et3B, affording &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity. The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.

The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal-&#960;-allyl species are amenable to nucleophilic attack by the chiral Cu-azomethine ylide, the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, affording &#945;-quaternary &#945;-amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity. The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B additive and the origins of stereo- and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facilitating Molecular Activation and Proton Feeding by Dual Active Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;site synergism of vacant and protonated pyridine N in polymeric C3N4 significantly polarized the inert CO2 molecules and eliminates the formation energy barrier of key *COOH intermediates, inducing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity enhancement (183 times) in CO production. Our atomic&#8208;precision strategy offers a promising way to overcome the technical challenges in molecular activation and rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer during CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 provides an appealing way to alleviate the energy crisis and manage the global carbon balance but is limited by the high activation energy and the rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer. We now develop a dual&#8208;site strategy for high&#8208;efficiency CO2 conversion through polarizing CO2 molecules at pyridine N vacancies and accelerating the intermediate protonation by protonated pyridine N adjacent to nitrogen vacancies on polymeric carbon nitride. Our photocatalysts with atomic&#8208;level engineered active sites manifest a high CO production rate of 1835&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 183 times higher than the pristine bulk carbon nitride. Theoretical prediction and experimental studies confirm that such excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between vacant and protonated pyridine N in decreasing the formation energy of the key *COOH intermediates and the efficient electron transfer relay facilitated by the defect&#8208;induced shallow trap state and homogeneous charge mediators.

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion Along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF) is insensitive to the pathway followed, the co&#8208;assembly of LPF with naphthylamine derivatives is pathway&#8208;dependent. The helical nanofibers of LPF transform into diverse kinetically trapped chiral structures with opposite chirality through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway (pathway B), while only thermodynamically stable nonhelical structures are formed by the thermodynamic pathway (pathway&#8197;A).







Abstract
Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand biological processes, but still remains a challenge to realize in artificial systems. Herein, helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained by a thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide an approach to explore chirality inversion accompanied by morphology transition by manipulating the kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.

         <title>Narrowband Emissive TADF Conjugated Polymers towards Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emissions are developed by attaching multiple resonance emitting moieties as pendants onto the polycarbazole backbone, and the resulting OLEDs achieve a maximum EQE of 17.5&#8201;% with FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) conjugated polymers usually show broad emission spectra due to the large structure relaxation, which is not desirable for high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. Herein, through attaching multiple resonance (MR) induced emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emission are demonstrated. The obtained conjugated polymers exhibit typical TADF characteristics with narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 33&#8211;43&#8197;nm. The solution&#8208;processed devices employing these polymers as emissive layers realize excellent performances with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.5&#8201;%, emission peak at 496&#8197;nm and FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.

Nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes with boronic acids is achieved triggered by C(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation, which provides an expedient access to 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkably high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing groups into organic molecules can significantly affect their physical and chemical properties and has long been used as an effective strategy for drug discovery and development. Consequently, the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles is highly desirable and sought after. Herein, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes, providing an expedient access to synthetically attractive 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee,&gt;35 examples). This protocol features readily available starting materials and excellent functional group compatibility, and exhibits complementary regioselectivity. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.

         <title>Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8208;free access to poly(cyclopentene carbonate) and its chemical recycling to monomer were achieved by using a dinuclear bifunctional organoboron catalyst, enriching the portfolio of the circular plastic economy.







Abstract
Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO2 and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO2 utilization. Currently, problems remain to be solved, include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal&#8208;free access to PCPC by using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0&#8197;kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near&#8208;quantitative yield (&gt;99&#8201;%).

     alt="Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first metal-free access to poly(cyclopentene carbonate) and its chemical recycling to monomer were achieved by using a dinuclear bifunctional organoboron catalyst, enriching the portfolio of the circular plastic economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization. Currently, problems remain to be solved, include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal-free access to PCPC by using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0&#8197;kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near-quantitative yield (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%). The preparation and depolymerization of PCPC along with in depth understanding of related mechanisms would be helpful for further development of advanced catalysts and recyclable plastics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Economic Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic cascade catalysis consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been created for the high&#8208;throughput RAFT synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight polymers, under benchtop conditions at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) polymers by green approaches is highly desirable but remains unexplored. We report the creation of an atom&#8208;economic enzymatic cascade catalysis, consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), that enables high&#8208;throughput reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) synthesis of UHMW polymers at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L. FOx transforms formic acid, a C1 substrate, and oxygen to CO2 and H2O2, respectively. CO2 can escape from solution while H2O2 is harnessed in situ by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen&#8208;tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96&#8208;well plates to produce libraries of well&#8208;defined UHMW polymers, and represents the first example of high&#8208;throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.

         <title>Comprehensive Fragment Screening of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteome Explores Novel Chemical Space for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a fragment&#8208;based screening strategy by NMR, we identified 311 small molecule binders of 25 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteins, thus expanding the previously unexplored chemical and target space. Further, using experimental and bioinformatic analysis we identify potential binding sites. This comprehensive data would greatly assist medicinal chemistry efforts even beyond COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (SCoV2) and its variants of concern pose serious challenges to the public health. The variants increased challenges to vaccines, thus necessitating for development of new intervention strategies including anti&#8208;virals. Within the international Covid19&#8208;NMR consortium, we have identified binders targeting the RNA genome of SCoV2. We established protocols for the production and NMR characterization of more than 80&#8201;% of all SCoV2 proteins. Here, we performed an NMR screening using a fragment library for binding to 25 SCoV2 proteins and identified hits also against previously unexplored SCoV2 proteins. Computational mapping was used to predict binding sites and identify functional moieties (chemotypes) of the ligands occupying these pockets. Striking consensus was observed between NMR&#8208;detected binding sites of the main protease and the computational procedure. Our investigation provides novel structural and chemical space for structure&#8208;based drug design against the SCoV2 proteome.

         <title>Engineering of Reversible NIR&#8208;II Redox&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Probes for Imaging of Inflammation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of trimethine skeleton NIR&#8208;II fluorophores (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) with improved stability over traditional heptamethine NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and emission above 1000&#8197;nm. The NIR&#8208;II Cy3s can reversibly respond to HClO and reactive sulfur species (RSS) and can serve as an effective platform for the reversible monitoring of the HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox process in a pathophysiology environment. Finally, we applied NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 to the reversible assessment of the redox environment and dynamic effect of drug treatment in an acute inflammation model and of redox potential changes during liver injury and repair.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent imaging shows great potential for deep tissue analysis at high resolution in living body owing to low background autofluorescence and photon scattering. However, reversible monitoring of redox homeostasis using NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate probes. In this study, a series of stable and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II dyes (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) were constructed based on trimethine skeleton. Significantly, introducing the 1,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;decahydroquinoxaline group to the NIR&#8208;II Cy3s not only effectively increased the wavelength, but also served as an effective response site for HClO, which can be restored by reactive sulfur species (RSS). Based on this, NIR&#8208;II Cy3s were used for reversible monitoring of HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox processes in the pathophysiology environment. Finally, NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 was successfully utilized for assessment of the redox environments and drug treatment effects in acute inflammation model.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol&#8208;based Ultrathin Microporous Nanofilms for Highly Efficient Molecular Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin microporous polymer composite membranes with extraordinary perm&#8208;selectivity for organic solvent nanofiltration were fabricated by employing two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives as IP monomers. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Moreover, it can achieve precise separation of organic molecules with similar molecular weights on their charge and molecular size.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging membrane separation technology, which urgently requires robust, easily processed, OSN membranes possessing high permeance and small solutes&#8208;selectivity to facilitate enhanced industrial uptake. Herein, we describe the use of two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives to fabricate hyper&#8208;crosslinked, microporous polymer nanofilms through IP. Ultra&#8208;thin, defect&#8208;free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino&#8208;BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut&#8208;off as low as 233&#8197;Da and MeOH permeance of &#8776;13&#8197;LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W. based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.

Ultra-thin, defect-free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper-crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino-BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut-off as low as 233&#8197;Da and MeOH permeance of &#8776;13&#8197;LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W. based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Control of Selenium Functionalization in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Two region&#8208;specific selenium&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors flanking conjugated side chains are compared with their sulfur&#8208;based analogue. mPh4F&#8208;TS with selenium at the outer positions show the most rigid skeleton, red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS organic solar cells exhibit the lowest energetic disorders, the highest charge carrier mobility and the best photon response, affording a top&#8208;ranking efficiency of &gt;18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Central &#960;&#8208;core engineering of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) is effective in boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Especially, selenium (Se) functionalization of NF&#8208;SMAs is considered a promising strategy but the structure&#8208;performance relationship remains unclear. Here, we synthesize two isomeric alkylphenyl&#8208;substituted selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs named mPh4F&#8208;TS and mPh4F&#8208;ST with different substitution positions, and contrast them with the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based analogue, mPh4F&#8208;TT. When placing Se atoms at the outer positions of the &#960;&#8208;core, mPh4F&#8208;TS shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact molecular stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS devices exhibit excellent absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS achieves more balanced photovoltaic parameters and yields an efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%, which highlights that precisely manipulating selenium functionalization is a practicable way toward high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Hydroxylation in Diiron &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylase CmlA Transpires by Amine&#8208;Assisted O2 Activation Avoiding FeIV2O2 Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM modeling revealed that the C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of L&#8208;PAPA in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires unprecedentedly through a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation pathway. This novel O2 activation mode modulated by the L&#8208;PAPA substrate, which is associated with the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding, opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities in O2 activation by non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.







Abstract
Through QM/MM modeling, we discovered that C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic&#8208;amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl FeIV2O2 species, but alternatively renders a diferric FeIII2O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O2 activation mode, the derived C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O2 activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases with an amine group adjacent to the C&#8722;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, such as hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding in CmlA opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O2 activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.

         <title>Reversible Light&#8208;Controlled CO Adsorption via Tuning &#960;&#8208;Complexation of Cu+ Sites in Azobenzene&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu+ into azobenzene&#8208;decorated metal&#8208;organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light&#8208;responsive motifs and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexing sites. Ultraviolet&#8208;/visible&#8208;light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu+. This exposure/shelter effect adjusts CO capture and release by shifting light.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive adsorbents capture significant attention due to their tailorable performance upon light irradiation. The modulation of such adsorbents is mainly based on weak (physical) interactions caused by steric hindrance while tuning strong interaction with target adsorbates is scarce. Here we report smart &#960;&#8208;complexation adsorbents, which can adjust the &#960;&#8208;complexation of active sites via light irradiation. A typical metal&#8208;organic framework, MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2, was decorated with azobenzene motifs, and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexation active sites were introduced subsequently. The reversible light&#8208;induced isomerization of azobenzene regulates the surface electrostatic potentials around Cu+ from &#8722;0.038 to 0.008&#8197;eV, causing shielding and exposure effects. The alteration of CO uptake is achieved up to 54&#8201;% via changing light, while that on MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 is negligible. This study provides a clue for designing target&#8208;specific smart materials to meet the practical stimuli&#8208;responsive adsorption demands.

         <title>A Universal Photoactivatable Tag Attached to Fluorophores Enables Their Use for Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for constructing photoactivatable probes by introducing a universal tag SO on fluorescent molecules. This strategy is applicable to most of the commercial fluorophores with various skeletal structures. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubules in fixed neurons.







Abstract
Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells. We developed a general strategy for photoactivatable fluorophores, using 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiine group (SO) as a tag to attach to various skeletal structures, including coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, and cyanine. The conjugation of SO resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Under the irradiation of excitation light, singlet oxygen generated by the fluorophores converted the SO moiety into its ester derivative, terminated the PeT process, and restored the fluorescence. Single molecule localization imaging was achieved using a dual functional illuminating beam in the visible, acting as both the activating and the exciting source. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubule structures in neurons.

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive nickel catalysis was leveraged to orchestrate the multicomponent union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and isobutyl chloroformate to assemble C&#8208;acyl glycosides in high anomeric selectivities. Computational studies provided insights that rationalize the origin of the high chemoselectivity. The method is applicable to the synthesis of complex C&#8208;linked disaccharides and late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of peptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated in situ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8722;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize C&#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Assembly of MOFs Colloidosomes for Bubble&#8208;Propelled Micromotors and Stirring&#8208;Free Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward strategy is designed to efficiently self&#8208;assemble MOF nanoparticles into robust MOFtors based on the Pickering emulsion. Such MOFtors are capable of enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring.







Abstract
The design of MOF&#8208;based micromotors (MOFtors) is still challenging and with limited approaches, especially for the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we report a universal and straightforward strategy to efficiently self&#8208;assembly MOF NPs into robust MOFtors for enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring. Based on the transient Pickering emulsion method, Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Fe&#8208;UiO) NPs are rapidly self&#8208;assembled into Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 colloidosomes (Fe&#8208;UiOSomes) on a large scale, and the formation mechanism is systematically studied. The Fe&#8208;UiOSomes&#8208;Pt micromotors through chemical reduction (Micromotor&#8208;C) presented a higher motility of 450&#177;180&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a 5&#8197;wt% H2O2 aqueous solution. Finally, the bubble&#8208;propelled Micromotor&#8208;C was employed to efficiently remove dyes and heavy metal ions (94&#8201;% for MO and 91&#8201;% for CrVI).

         <title>Thiolated, Reduced Palladium Nanoclusters with Resolved Structures for the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first atomically monodisperse thiolated Pd nanocluster is obtained. It has a +6 charged di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged &#956;&#8208;6 interstitial B atom. The as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Although thiolated, reduced Group 11 metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity have been repeatedly reported in the past decade, their Pd analogues have not been reported thus far. In this work, we provide a resolution for the challenging synthesis and obtain for the first time an atomically monodisperse thiolated, reduced Pd (q=+0.75) nanocluster with a di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged interstitial B atom, as revealed by ESI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, etc. &#956;&#8208;6 B is found for the first time in Group 10 and 11 metal nanoclusters. More importantly, the as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and even a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), having significant implications for the influence of the metal charge state and space structure on the catalytic activity.

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.







Abstract
We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.

         <dc:description>
New fluorine/chlorine regio&#8208;regular hetero&#8208;trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of Y&#8208;Cl and Y&#8208;FCl and is the highest efficiency for the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs.

Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65&#8201;%, outperforming the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FCl and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs. Our results demonstrate that difluoro&#8208;monochloro hetero&#8208;terminal is a superior regio&#8208;regular unit for enhancing the intermolecular crystal packing and photovoltaic performance of hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs.

&lt;p&gt;New fluorine/chlorine regio-regular hetero-trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single-crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero-halogenated SMAs. The &lt;b&gt;PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FClF&lt;/b&gt; achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of &lt;b&gt;Y-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Y-FCl&lt;/b&gt; and is the highest efficiency for the hetero-halogenated SMAs-based binary OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we synthesized new hetero-halogenated end groups with well-determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-FCl-IC and FClF-IC), and synthesized regioisomer-free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y-Cl, Y-FCl, and Y-FClF with distinct hetero-halogenated terminals, respectively. The single-crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y-FClF exhibits more compact three-dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;-&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y-FCl. From Y-Cl to Y-FCl to Y-FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face-on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films.

Abstract
Soellner published on the interplay between allosteric and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;competitive inhibitors of ABL kinase, showing that the latter preferably binds to different conformational states of ABL compared to allosteric agents that specifically target the ABL myristate pocket (STAMP) and deducing that asciminib cannot bind to ABL simultaneously with ATP&#8208;competitive drugs. These results are to some extent in line with ours, although our analyses of dose&#8211;response matrices from combinations of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, show neither synergy nor antagonism, but suggest additive antiproliferative effects on BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent KCL22 cells. Furthermore, our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that asciminib can bind ABL concomitantly with type&#8208;1 or &#8208;2 ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors to form ternary complexes. Concomitant binding of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib might translate to benefit some chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.

Abstract
Manley and co&#8208;workers provide data demonstrating that, at super&#8208;pharmacological concentrations (300&#8197;&#956;M), a ternary complex between Abl, asciminib, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors is possible. The work in our manuscript concerns the interplay of asciminib (and GNF&#8208;2) with ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Cmax=1.6&#8211;3.7&#8197;&#956;M for asciminib). Manley and co&#8208;workers do not question any of the studies that we reported, nor do they provide explanations for how our work fits into their preferred model. Herein, we consider the data presented by Manley and co&#8208;workers. In addition, we provide new data supporting the findings in our Communication. Asciminib and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors do not simultaneously bind Abl at pharmacologically relevant concentrations unless the conformation selectivity for both ligands is matched.

How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8211;&#8211;layer by layer&#8211;&#8211;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+ core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton's positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211066).

Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (e202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle, and co&#8208;workers present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometers.

Spectral tuning , from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202209670).

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes recent advances regarding the preparation of complex and stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules by routes originating from purchasable or readily accessible alkenyl and allylic fluorides. The untapped potential of other, far less explored, commercially available organofluorine compounds as launching points for the development of stereoselective processes that may be valuable to drug discovery is underscored.







Abstract
Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One approach entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8722;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF3 or CF2H), and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.

Efforts to deepen the understanding of sustainable development have resulted in the concept of green carbon science. In this Review, technological achievements in green carbon science are discussed, with a focus on pilot testing, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.







Abstract
The concept of green carbon science is to promote the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the importance and urgency of which have been well&#8208;recognized and received worldwide attention. Carbon neutrality has become the focus of research work in many fields, and correspondingly, a growing number of papers and publications have been published over the last few years. However, since carbon neutralization is a real problem that urgently requires technical solutions, the transition from fundamental research to practical applications must be accelerated. A number of research teams are bold in putting things into practice and blazing new trails. This Review summarizes the recent technological developments within the framework of green carbon science, focusing on conducted pilot tests, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in the Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the production of HCHO from CO2, including chemical catalysis (hydrogenation using H2 and hydroboration/hydrosilylation), photo/electrocatalysis, and biocatalysis (enzymatic reduction). From analysis of advantages and deficits of each methodology, we present viewpoints and potential strategies for optimizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion.







Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.

         <title>Total Syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocephalone A and (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocequinones A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (1) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (4) and B (5). An initially&#8208;envisioned intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder strategy guided the evolution of a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization approach that allowed for access to the carbocyclic core of 1. Further advancement by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations and rearrangements allowed for conversion to 1, 4, and 5.







Abstract

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Exhaustive Reduction of Oxo&#8208;Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system involving titanium used for the exhaustive reduction of carboxylic acid derivatives to the corresponding methyl compounds is reported. The catalytic system also works with other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates while the products might be promising for bio&#8208;applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the in situ generated TiIII&#8722;H species was key for this transformation.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives all the way to their corresponding methyl&#8208;compounds is very rare and still challenging for homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report an unprecedented and general catalytic exhaustive reduction of carboxylic functional group straightforwardly to a methyl group. This reaction was achieved using earth&#8208;abundant and readily available titanium as a catalyst. Our system has broad functional group tolerance and works for various other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the in situ&#8208;generated TiIII&#8722;H species was vital for this transformation.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Assisted Click&#8208;Chemistry for Proximity&#8208;Driven, Site&#8208;Specific Acetylation of Histones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a proximity&#8208;driven, lysine&#8208;specific acetylation approach to construct precisely acetylated histone proteins. The approach is facilitated by a click reagent equipped with an acetate group donor to acetylate a nearby lysine in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of histones are essential in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Among these modifications, lysine acetylation is one of the most established. Earlier studies relied on the use of chromatin containing heterogeneous mixtures of histones acetylated at multiple sites. Differentiating the individual contribution of single acetylation events towards chromatin regulation is thus of great relevance. However, it is difficult to access homogeneous samples of histones, with a single acetylation, in sufficient quantities for such studies. By engineering histone H3 with a cysteine in proximity of the lysine of interest, we demonstrate that conjugation with maleimide&#8208;DBCO followed by a strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction results in the acetylation of a single lysine in a controlled, site&#8208;specific manner. The chemical precision offered by our click&#8208;to&#8208;acetylate approach will facilitate access to and the study of acetylated histones.

         <title>Photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Pyridination via Arene&#8211;Pyridinium Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage the photoexcitation of arene&#8211;pyridinium electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes to achieve C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination. Black light irradiation of the simple combination of arene substrate, pyridine, acid (to generate a pyridinium acceptor in situ), and O2 (terminal oxidant) affords N&#8208;arylpyridinium products. This transformation proceeds without an exogenous photocatalyst, complementing prior photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H amination methods.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light (&#955;max&#8776;350&#8197;nm) irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8722;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered SNAr pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this report represents an inexpensive and atom&#8208;economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions that eliminates the requirement of an exogenous photocatalyst.

         <title>Design of Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts for Direct Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical composition of frustrated Lewis pairs is mapped to their performance in catalytic direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using linear scaling relationships. This map highlights the need for appropriately balancing the acidity and basicity of the components for enhanced activity, which led to the demonstration of hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.







Abstract
Despite recent progress in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), direct FLP&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 remains elusive. From a near&#8208;infinite array of plausible Lewis pairs, it is challenging to identify individual combinations that are appropriate for catalyzing this reaction. To this end, we propose a mapping of the chemical composition of FLPs to their activity towards direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into formate. The maps, built upon linear scaling relationships, pinpoint specific FLP combinations with the proper complementary acidity and basicity to optimally balance the energetics of the catalytic cycle. One such combination was experimentally validated to achieve hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.

In this work, difunctionalization of 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered enecarbamates is achieved using both Cu/Pd and Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good selectivity. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Two catalytic systems have been developed for the arylboration of endocyclic enecarbamates to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A Cu/Pd dual catalytic reaction enables the synthesis of borylated, &#945;&#8208;arylated azetidines, while a Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration reaction efficiently functionalizes 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered enecarbamates. In the case of the Cu/Pd&#8208;system, a remarkable additive effect was identified that allowed for broader scope. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable and Red&#8208;Emissive Radical Cation for Mutp53 Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive radical cation P.+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn was developed for mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of zinc ions to promote degradation of mutp53 in cancer cells via proteasome&#8208;dependent pathway and facilitate abrogation of various mutp53&#8208;conferred gain of function phenotypes.







Abstract
Compared with conventional closed&#8208;shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non&#8208;emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive and water&#8208;stable pyrrole radical cation P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn by air oxidation. The deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn can be used for imaging&#8208;guided mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of Zn2+ into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53&#8208;manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

An osmium nitride is shown to insert nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. A synthetic cycle to regenerate the starting nitride is presented alongside mechanistic studies of each step.







Abstract
Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [cis&#8208;terpyOsNCl2]PF6 inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Boroaminomethylation of Olefins to &#947;&#8208;Boryl Amines with CO as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as &#8722;CH2&#8208;source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond was described. In the present of CuCl and Xantphos as the catalyst, a variety of &#947;&#8208;boryl amines were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance. The new aromatization and other transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrate their utility. Notably, 13C labeled product was produced with isotope&#8208;labeled 13CO.







Abstract
Boroaminomethylation of olefins is an efficient process to convert hydrocarbons directly into boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Such chemicals are a good handle for obtaining more complexed amine derivatives through the various transformations of organoboron. However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond. This method affords valuable &#947;&#8208;boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably, 13C labeling studies revealed that the &#8722;CH2&#8208;building block was derived from one molecule of CO.

         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.







Abstract
We report that synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior is robust and governed by the chirality of the proline units. It paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as a simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Hydride&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D&#8208;Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;The first nickel-hydride-catalyzed diastereo- and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D-Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel-hydride-catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulation&#8208;Guided Design of a Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
After demonstrating the potential of Th&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (nMOF) as excellent radiosensitizer with Monte Carlo simulations, we designed Th&#8208;DBP nMOF with Th6 secondary building units and DBP photosensitizers for efficient radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy. Th&#8208;DBP greatly enhanced hydroxyl radical and 1O2 generation upon irradiation to kill cancer cells and regress colon and pancreatic cancers in mice models.







Abstract
High&#8208;Z metal&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) with photosensitizing ligands can enhance radiation damage to tumors via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RT&#8208;RDT) process. Here we report Monte Carlo (MC) simulation&#8208;guided design of a Th&#8208;based nMOF built from Th6&#8208;oxo secondary building units and 5,15&#8208;di(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (DBP) ligands, Th&#8208;DBP, for enhanced RT&#8208;RDT. MC simulations revealed that the Th&#8208;lattice outperformed the Hf&#8208;lattice in radiation dose enhancement owing to its higher mass attenuation coefficient. Upon X&#8208;ray or &#947;&#8208;ray radiation, Th&#8208;DBP enhanced energy deposition, generated more reactive oxygen species, and induced significantly higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells over the previously reported Hf&#8208;DBP nMOF. With low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, Th&#8208;DBP suppressed tumor growth by 88&#8201;% in a colon cancer and 97&#8201;% in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell ZnO@Microporous Organic Polymer Nanospheres as Enhanced Piezo&#8208;Triboelectric Energy Harvesting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO core&#8208;triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP) shell nanoparticles showed enhanced small energy harvesting performance, compared with ZnO and MOP. The piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG) with the optimized 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% ZnO@MOP/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) film showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell nanospheres were prepared by the homogeneous coating of piezoelectric ZnO nanorod aggregates with triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP). The small energy harvesting performance of ZnO@MOP was significantly enhanced, compared with those of ZnO and MOP, due to the piezoelectrification&#8208;induced polarization of inner ZnO and the enhanced generation of tribopositive charges of MOP. Piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerators (PTENGs) fabricated with ZnO@MOP showed peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, the PTENGs showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles, demonstrating as efficient power sources for charging electrolytic capacitors and for operating 200 green light emitting diode bulbs.

After many years of being invoked as an intermediate, the existence of PhI(OTf)2 was recently disproven. Taking advantage of a nitro substituent that suppresses decomposition; an NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2 molecule has been synthesized and structurally characterized.







Abstract
PhI(OTf)2 and related ArI(OTf)2 species have been incorrectly invoked as intermediates in oxidation reactions for many years. We recently established that such compounds did not yet exist but remain an attractive target. Here we describe the synthesis, isolation, and structural characterization of NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2, which is resistant to decomposition and more reactive than PhI(OTf)(OAc), the species previously misidentified as PhI(OTf)2.

         <title>Perfectly Isotactic Polypropylene upon In Situ Activation of Ultrarigid meso Hafnocenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ activation, hafnocene meso&#8208;I yields isotactic polypropylene instead of atactic polypropylene of meso&#8208;I and rac&#8208;I. With our easy and convenient isomerization and polymerization protocol, productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers are accessible.







Abstract
For more than 40&#8197;years, the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric indenyl&#8208;based racemic metallocenes for the isoselective polymerization of propylene relied on a tedious separation of the produced rac and meso isomers. Status quo, latter are considered wasteful as they produce atactic polypropylene (aPP) rather than isotactic polypropylene (iPP) if activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Unexpectedly, the in situ activation of meso hafnocene I yielded perfectly isotactic polypropylene. We verified an isomerization of the meso compound to the corresponding racemic one upon triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) addition via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and established an easy and convenient polymerization protocol, enabling productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers. With this established isomerization protocol, the potential yield of iPP was enhanced by more than 400&#8201;%. This protocol was also shown to be applicable to other meso hafnocenes and some initial mechanistic insights were received.

         <title>A Topology&#8208;Defined Polyester Elastomer from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: A One&#8208;Pot&#8208;One&#8208;Step &#8220;Scrambling Polymerizations&#8221; Strategy</title>

A novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is realized to produce polyester with tunable topologies by one&#8208;pot&#8208;one&#8208;step ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of a substituted &#948;&#8208;lactone derived from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;butadiene with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone mediated by sodium phenolate. The obtained transparent, non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable network presents great resilience and excellent elastic recovery properties for application as a polyester elastomer.







Abstract
It is significant and challenging to use CO2 to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO2&#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting in polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with a tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break of &gt;600&#8201;% can be used as an elastomer. We propose a method to provide polyester elastomers from CO2 and olefins for the first time, and expand the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed via catalytic transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer strategy. More importantly, this annulation represents a rare example of construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through tandem PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation process.







Abstract
Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization and Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of PdII&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.

         <title>Structure of the (Bi)carbonate Adlayer on Cu(100) Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular&#8208;scale structure of the interface between copper electrodes and bicarbonate electrolyte, a key system for electrochemical CO2 reduction, is clarified by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, revealing two highly complex coexisting adlayer structures above a critical potential. Ab initio calculations identify these as carbonate/water coadsorbate layers and indicate a strongly stabilizing effect of the adjacent liquid solution.







Abstract
(Bi)carbonate adsorption on Cu(100) in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 has been studied by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with (
&#215;6
)R45&#176; and (4&#215;4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order&#8208;disorder phase transition at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional calculations indicate that the adlayer consists of coadsorbed carbonate and water molecules and is strongly stabilized by liquid water in the adjacent electrolyte.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Pyritide A2 through Pyridine Ring Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide pyritide A2 is reported. Inspired by biosynthesis, which proceeds through cycloaddition of post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, the described approach features rapid synthesis of a trisubstituted pyridine directly from a simple amino acid precursor. This strategy proved general for the preparation of different pyridines associated with this class of natural products.







Abstract
Pyritides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide class of natural products that were recently genome&#8208;predicted and are structurally defined by unique pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycles. Inspired by their biosynthesis, proceeding through peptide modification and cycloaddition to form the heterocyclic core, we report the chemical synthesis of pyritide A2 involving pyridine ring synthesis from an amino acid precursor through aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This strategy permitted the preparation of the decorated pyridine core with an appended amino acid residue in two steps from a commercially available arginine derivative and secured pyritide A2 in ten steps. Moreover, the synthetic logic enables efficient preparation of different pyridine subunits associated with pyritides, allowing rapid and convergent access to this new class of natural products and analogues thereof.

         <title>Direct Observation of &#8220;Elongated&#8221; Conformational States in &#945;&#8208;Synuclein upon Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a modified cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive Pairing StatisticS), we unravel conformational changes of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein upon liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). The conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states in liquid droplets. During this early LLPS stage, &#945;&#8208;synuclein remains monomeric and highly flexible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble intracellular Lewy bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be related to &#945;&#8208;syn LLPS. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into &#945;&#8208;syn upon LLPS, we take advantage of cross&#8208;linking/mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) and introduce an innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this work, we show that the conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;syn shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states upon LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish a novel mass spectrometry&#8208;based approach that will aid to solve open questions in LLPS structural biology.

         <title>A Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Molecular Cage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Enzymatic Photocyclization of Alkynylaniline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes facilitate chemical conversionsvia the collective activity of aggregated components, but the marriage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with the molecular containers to emulate the enzymatic conversion remain challenges. Herein, we reported a new approach to construct a PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage with AIE characteristics for the photocyclization of alkynylaniline via restricting the rotation of pendant phenyl rings peripheral to the PtII&#8208;corner. With the presence of water, the C&#8208;H&#8230;&#960;&#160;interactions corresponding to the triphenylphosphine fragments aggregated the molecular cages into spherical particles and enhanced the PtII&#8208;based luminescence significantly. The kinetically inert Pt&#8208;NP chelator, the well&#8208;modified redox potentials in the ground and excited states and the efficient coordination activation of the platinum corner facilitated the excellent catalysis in photocyclization of alkynylaniline. The enzymatic kinetics and advantages to bind and activate substrate in aqueous medium endow a new avenue to develop mimics for efficient photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonlinear Optical Crystal with a Building Block Containing Expanded &#960;&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Common nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals consist of traditional functional building blocks with inherent optical limitation. Herein, inspired by traditional (B3O6)3&#8208; inorganic building block, we theoretically identified a new type of organic functional building blocks and then successfully synthesized the first cyamelurate NLO crystal, Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O. To our surprise, the constituent (H2C6N7O3)&#8208; building block is not in structurally optimal arrangement, but Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O exhibits excellent optical properties including wide bandgap of 4.10 eV, very large birefringence of 0.24@550 nm, and exceptionally strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response of about 12 &#215; KH2PO4. Both the SHG response and birefringence are much larger than those of commercial NLO crystal &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 with optimally aligned (B3O6)3&#8208; building block. Theoretical calculations suggest that the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugation delocalization within (H2C6N7O3)&#8208;vs (B3O6)3&#8208; should be responsible to the enhanced performance. This work implies that there is still much room to develop new NLO crystals with excellent functional building blocks that may be longly neglected.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Facially Coordinating&#160;P,N,N&#160;Ligand for Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Ketones.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT calculations on the full catalytic cycle for manganese catalysed enantioselective hydrogenation of a selection of ketones have been carried out&#160;at the PBE0&#8208;D3PCM//RI&#8208;BP86PCM&#160;level. Mn complexes of an enantiomerically pure chiral&#160;P,N,N&#160;ligand have been found to be most reactive when adopting a facial coordination mode. The use of a new ligand with an&#160;ortho&#8208;substituted dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine motif has been calculated to completely transform the levels of enantioselectivity possible for the hydrogenation of cyclic ketones relative to the first&#8208;generation Mn catalysts.&#160;In silicoevaluation of&#160;&#160;substrates has been used to identify those likely to be reduced with high enantiomer ratios (er), and others that would exhibit less selectivity; good agreements were then found in experiments. Various cyclic ketones and some acetophenone derivatives were hydrogenated with&#160;er&#8217;s&#160;up to 99:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation and Reduction Pathways in the Knowles Hydroamination via a Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles&#8217;s light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination. Bond formation/cleavage competes with single electron transfer (SET) between the catalyst and substrate. These processes are described by adiabatic processes through transition states in an electronic state and non&#8208;radiative transitions through the seam of crossings (SX) between different electronic states. This study determined the energetically favorable SET path by introducing a practical computational model representing SET as non&#8208;adiabatic transitions via SXs between substrate's potential energy surfaces for different charge states adjusted based on the catalyst's redox potential. Calculations showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly. Also, the relative importance of SET paths (giving the product and leading back to the reactant) varies depending on the catalyst's redox potential, affecting the yield.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;soluble Self&#8208;assembled {Pd84}Ac Polyoxopalladate Nano&#8208;wheel as a Supramolecular Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxopalladates (POPs) are a class of self&#8208;assembling palladium&#8208;oxide clusters that span a variety of sizes, shapes and compositions. The largest of this family, {Pd84}Ac, is constructed from 14 building units of {Pd6} and lined on the inner and outer torus by 28 acetate ligands. Due to its high water solubility, large hydrophobic cavity and distinct 1H NMR fingerprint {Pd84}Ac is an ideal molecule for exploring supramolecular behaviour with small organic molecules in aqueous media. Molecular modelling studies highlighted potential binding sites between {Pd84}Ac and these species. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, including 1H NMR, 1H Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (NOESY), were employed to study the supramolecular chemistry of this system. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that {Pd84}Ac forms a 1:7 host&#8208;guest complex with benzyl viologen (BV2+) in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

Molecular modelling studies highlighted potential binding sites between {Pd84}Ac and these species. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, including 1H NMR, 1H Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (NOESY), were employed to study the supramolecular chemistry of this system. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that {Pd84}Ac forms a 1:7 host-guest complex with benzyl viologen (BV2+) in aqueous solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization reaction, in which two chemically distinct functional groups are transferred between two molecules, has long been an unmet goal due to the daunting challenges in controlling the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclose an electrochemistry enabled shuttle reaction (  e  &#8208;shuttle) to selectively transfer one RS  &#8210;  and one X  &#8210;  group between &#946;&#8208;halosulfide and unsaturated hydrocarbons via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other, which is controlled by their distinct redox potentials, plays a pivotal role in controlling the high chemoselectivity of the process. This easily scalable methodology enables the construction of a myriad of densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;halo alkenyl sulfides in unprecedented chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity using benign surrogates, e.g., 2&#8208;bromoethyl sulfide, avoiding the handling of corrosive and oxidative RS&#8211;Br reagents. In a broader context, these results open up new strategies for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Induces Symmetry Breaking in Layered Dipeptide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of symmetry breaking of materials provides large opportunities to regulate their properties and functions. Herein, we report breaking the symmetry of layered dipeptide crystals by utilizing CO2&#160;  to induce the adjacent monomolecular layers to stack from the opposite to the same direction. The role of CO2  is to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. Further, the dipeptide crystals exhibit far superior piezoelectricity after symmetry breaking and the piezoelectric voltage generated from the dipeptide&#8208;based generators becomes more than 500% higher than before. This work reveals a potential route to engineer structures and properties of layered materials and provides a deep insight into the control of non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens for In Vivo Theranostics of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimized theranostic strategy for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) remains almost vacant from bench to clinic. Current probes and drugs attempting to prevent &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrosis encountered failures due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration challenge and blind intervention time window. Herein, we designed a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, via balanced hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity. DNTPH binds selectively to A&#946; fibrils with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In vivo imaging revealed its excellent BBB permeability and long&#8208;term tracking ability with high&#8208;performance AD diagnosis. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis and fibril disassembly thereby attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity. DNTPH treatment significantly reduced A&#946; plaques and rescued learning deficits in AD mice. Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real&#8208;time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Electrochemical Peptide Modifications: Unlocking New Levels of Orthogonality for Side&#8208;Chain Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue&#8208;specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side&#8208;chains as underutilized handles for late&#8208;stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary&#8208;assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side&#8208;chain N,S&#8208;acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high&#8208;value N,O&#8208;acetal functionalities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for an electrochemical peptide stapling protocol, as well as the functionalization of dynorphin B, an endogenous opioid peptide, demonstrates the applicability of the method to intricate peptide systems. Finally, the site&#8208;selective and tunable electrochemical modification of a peptide bearing two discretely oxidizable sites is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Deep Eutectic Solvents with TEMPO&#8208;based Polymer Electrodes: Influence of Molar Ratio on Electrode Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For sustainable energy storage, all&#8208;organic batteries based on redox&#8208;active polymers promise to become an alternative to lithium ion batteries. Yet, polymers contribute to the goal of an all&#8208;organic cell as electrodes or as solid electrolytes. Here, we replace the electrolyte with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of&#160;sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) and&#160;N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA), while using&#160;poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxyl methacrylate) (PTMA) as cathode. The successful combination of a DES with a polymer electrode is reported here for the first time. The electrochemical stability of PTMA electrodes in the DES at the eutectic molar ratio of 1:6 is comparable to conventional battery electrolytes. More viscous electrolytes with higher salt concentration can hinder cycling at high rates. Lower salt concentration leads to decreasing capacities and faster decomposition. The eutectic mixture of 1:6 is best suited uniting high stability and moderate viscosity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (  E  )&#8208; or (  Z  )&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine  cis  &#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode with 96% Utilization Rate Enabled by Solvation Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZURs under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of 96% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24 mAh cm&#8208;2. In a ZUR of 67%, the developed Zn&#8208;V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500 cycles with an energy density of 180 Wh kg&#8208;1 and Zn&#8208;AC capacitor is stable for 5000 cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZURs of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large-scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZURs under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of 96% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24 mAh cm-2. In a ZUR of 67%, the developed Zn-V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500 cycles with an energy density of 180 Wh kg-1 and Zn-AC capacitor is stable for 5000 cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZURs of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A De Novo&#8208;Designed Type 3 Copper Protein Tunes Catechol Substrate Recognition and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>De novo metalloprotein design is a remarkable approach to shape protein scaffolds toward specific functions. Here, we report the design and characterization of Due Rame 1 (DR1), a de novo designed protein housing a di&#8208;copper site and mimicking the Type 3 (T3) copper&#8208;containing polyphenol oxidases (PPOs).
To achieve this goal, we hierarchically designed the first and the second di&#8208;metal coordination spheres to engineer the di&#8208;copper site into a simple four&#8208;helix bundle scaffold. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and functional characterization revealed that DR1 recapitulates the T3 copper site, supporting different copper redox states, and being active in the O  2  &#8208;dependent oxidation of catechols to  o  &#8208;quinones. Careful design of the residues lining the substrate access site endows DR1 with substrate recognition, as revealed by Hammet analysis and computational studies on substituted catechols. This study represents a premier example in the construction of a functional T3 copper site into a designed four&#8208;helix bundle protein.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;Containing Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor&#160;Enables Self&#8208;Stratification in Organic&#160;Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elaborate control of the vertical phase distribution within an active layer is critical to ensuring the high performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), but is challenging. Herein, a self&#8208;stratification active layer is realised by adding a novel polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing non&#8208;fullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptor (NFSMA), EH&#8208;C8F17, as the guest into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. A favourable vertical morphology was obtained with an upper acceptor&#8208;enriched thin layer and a lower undisturbed bulk heterojunction layer. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 18.03% was achieved, higher than the efficiency of 17.40% for the device without EH&#8208;C8F17. Additionally, benefiting from the improved charge transport and collection realised by this self&#8208;stratification strategy, the OSC with a thickness of 350 nm had an impressive PCE of 16.89%. The results of the study indicate that polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing NFSMA&#8208;assisted self&#8208;stratification within the active layer is effective for realising an ideal morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytically stable potassium single&#8208;atom solid superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400 oC. Further increasing the temperature to 800 oC, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carbonylation&#8208;Cyclization of Enallenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With electricity as green oxidant, a catalytic amount of benzoquinone (BQ) was used as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) in palladium&#8208;based electrocatalysis to provide highly efficient access to &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones skeletons in an undivided cell. This represents the first successful example of an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenes.







Abstract
Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to a more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiTFSI&#8208;TMP&#8208;H2O electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stable window of 3.7&#8197;V are rationally designed by controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry. Benefiting from reduced H2O activity and reinforced solid electrolyte interphase, the assembled water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cell with a limited P/N ratio of 1.14 can achieve a long cycling life with high coulombic efficiency.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3.0&#8197;V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000&#8197;times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.

         <title>Structural Engineering toward Gold Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters are promising catalysts, and their molecular nature facilitates the design and controlled synthesis of cluster catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the strategies for constructing active sites and the effects of the ligands on cluster catalysis. The challenges and key future issues regarding catalytic applications of gold nanoclusters are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, and both the core and shell have significant effects on the catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the effects of ligands on catalysis can be disclosed. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances in catalytic research of gold nanoclusters, emphasizing four strategies for constructing open metal sites, including by post&#8208;treatment, the bulky ligands strategy, the surface geometric mismatch method, and heteroatom doping procedures. We also discuss the effects of ligands on the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of gold cluster catalysts. Finally, we present future challenges relating to gold cluster catalysis.

         <title>Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Photocatalysts for Enhanced Control and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive photocatalytic materials have emerged that are not only able to efficiently catalyze reactions but can use external stimuli to modulate their physical properties. This technique has been used to control the reactivity of a photocatalytic material turning it on/off. Moreover, photocatalytic materials have been synthesized which can be easily recycled with the use of an external trigger.







Abstract
The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this Minireview, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning&#8208;Probe&#8208;Microscopy Images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a deep&#8208;learning framework to automatically analyse scanning&#8208;probe&#8208;microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.







Abstract
Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkably rapid CO2 reduction by solar light and water is achieved using molecular analogs of metal&#8208;oxide intercalated niobate nanosheets.







Abstract
Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion &#8220;fragments&#8221; of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8208;&#956;&#8208;O&#8208;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor &#8220;fragments&#8221; as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Outer&#8208;Shells for Sequentially Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, photocatalytic CO2&#8208;CO&#8208;CH4 conversion is realized by hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with hetero&#8208;shells. The enriched local CO concentration in inner shells and continuous protonation of CO on the outer&#8208;most shell enable the two&#8208;step tandem CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering hierarchical microreactors toward efficient tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO2 reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO2 shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO2 (A&#8208;TiO2) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion capability using one CeO2@CeO2/A&#8208;TiO2 HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) level was investigated by ECL microscopy. The Au NPs were assembled into an ordered array, providing a high&#8208;throughput platform that can easily locate each NP in sequential characterizations. A strong dependence of ECL intensity on Au NP configurations was observed. We demonstrate for the first time that at the single&#8208;particle level, the ECL of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;TPrA was majorly quenched by small Au NPs (&lt; 40 nm), while enhanced by large Au ones (&gt; 80 nm) due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Notably, the ECL intensity was further increased by the coupling effect of neighboring Au NPs. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations conformed well with the experimental results. This plasmon enhanced ECL microscopy for arrayed single NPs provides a reliable tool for screening electrocatalytic activity at a single particle.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective Activation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor&#160;7/8 Agonist Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Generates Safe Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses upon Systemic Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) prime adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity and hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, small&#8208;molecule TLR agonists cause immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) after systemic administration. Herein, we report&#160;a polymeric nano&#8208;immunomodulator&#160;(cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within the tumor. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ was obtained via&#160;self&#8208;assembly of a cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys)&#8208;modified amphiphilic copolymeric prodrug. Upon systemic administration,&#160;cN@SS&#8208;IMQ preferentially accumulated at tumor sites&#160;and&#160;responded to high intracellular glutathione levels&#160;to release native imidazoquinolines&#160;for dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing the infiltration of T lymphocytes. Collectively, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ tends to activate the immune system without irAEs, thus suggesting its promising potential for safe systemic targeting delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (~5 ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90 &#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22 ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90 &#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3 L/g). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Imine Directed Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8211;H Functionalization and Annulation with Amino Amides, Aldehydes, and Diazo&#160;Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multicomponent annulation that proceeds by imine directed Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8211;H functionalization is disclosed. The transformation affords piperazinones displaying a range of functionality and is the first example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent N&#8211;H functionalization. A broad range of readily available &#945;&#8208;amino amides, including those derived from glycine, &#945;&#8208;substituted, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids, were effective inputs and enabled the incorporation of a variety of amino acid side chains with minimal racemization. Branched and unbranched alkyl aldehydes and various stabilized diazo compounds were also efficient reactants. The piperazinone products were further modified through efficient transformations. Mechanistic studies, including X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization of a catalytically competent five&#8208;membered rhodacycle with imine and amide nitrogen chelation, provide support for the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable White Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Based on Chiral Co&#8208;assembled Helix Nanofiber Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>White circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs)are of great significance in potential lighting sources and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, High&#8208;performance white CP&#8208;EL sources are almost unexplored. We have constructed full&#8208;color CP&#8208;EL devices based on chiral co&#8208;assemblies by using three achiral conjugated pyrene&#8208;based dyes (BP, w&#8208;WPandc&#8208;WP)  doped with chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based enantiomers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M) as the EMLs through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 films exhibitregular helix nanofibers under annealing treatment and emit strong white CPL. Significantly, remarkable CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on(S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 were achieved with |gEL| values as high as 6.2 &#215; 10&#8208;2 and an excellent CRI of 98 at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). These are the highest gEL and CRI values of reported CP&#8208;WOLEDs to date. This is the first achievement of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on chiral co&#8208;assembled helix nanofiber emitters,and provides a valuable strategy with which to develop white CP&#8208;EL for future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Enzyme Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme immobilization is a widely reported manner to favor the applicability of enzyme by enhancing their stability and re&#8208;usability. Among the various existing solid&#8208;supports and immobilization strategies, the in&#8208;situ encapsulation of enzyme within crystalline porous matrices is a powerful tool to design biohybrid with a stable and protected catalytic activity. However, to date, only a few metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been reported. Excitingly, for the first time, Y. Chen and coworkers expanded the in&#8208;situ bio&#8208;encapsulation to a new class of crystalline porous material, namely covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The enzyme@COF materials not only exhibited high enzyme loading with minimal leaching, high catalytic activity and selectivity, chemical and long&#8208;term stability and recyclability but could also be scaled up to a few grams. Undoubtedly, this works opens striking new opportunities for enzymatic immobilization and will stimulate new research on COF based matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Double Hydrosilylation of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double hydrosilylation of alkynes represents a straightforward method to synthesize bis(silane)s, yet it is challenging if &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilanes act as the intermediates. Here, a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes is reported for the first time involving this challenge, accessing both vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s with exclusive regioselectivity. Various novel bis(silane)s containing Si&#8211;H bonds can be easily obtained. The gram&#8208;scale reactions could be performed smoothly. Preliminarily mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reactions were initiated by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of alkynes, followed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydrosilylation of the &#945;&#8208;vinylsilanes to deliver vicinal bis(silane)s, or hydride&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation to give geminal ones. Notably, these bis(silane)s can be used for the synthesis of high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index polymers (nd up to 1.83), demonstrating great potential utility in optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Automated Mannoside Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Automated glycan assembly (AGA) on solid support has become invaluable in reconciling the biological importance of complex carbohydrates with the persistent challenges associated with reproducible synthesis. Whilst AGA platforms have transformed the construction of many natural sugars, validation in the construction of well&#8208;defined (Site&#8208;selectively modified) glycomimetics is in its infancy. Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, the biomedical prominence of 2&#8208;fluoro sugars and the remarkable selectivities observed in fluorine&#8208;directed glycosylation, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (FDAGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the fluorine atom for stereocontrolled glycosylation on solid support, thereby eliminating the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. The logical design of C2&#8208;fluorinated mannose building blocks, and their application in the fully (&#945;&#8208;)stereocontrolled automated assembly of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannosides, is disclosed. This operationally simple strategy can be integrated into existing AGA and post&#8208;AGA protocols to augment the scope of programmed carbohydrate synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Hybrid Functional Fluoropolymers Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;controlled polymerizations are attractive to tailor macromolecules of complex compositions with spatiotemporal regulation. In this work, with a convenient synthesis for trifluorovinyl boronic ester (TFVB), we report a light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed copolymerization of vinyl monomers and TFVB for the first time, which enabled the controlled synthesis of a variety of hybrid fluorine/boron polymers with low dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The good behaviors of &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch, chain&#8208;extension polymerizations and post&#8208;modifications further highlight the versatility and reliability of this copolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of fluorine and boron could furnish copolymer electrolytes of high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (up to 0.83), bringing new opportunities of engineering high&#8208;performance materials for energy storage purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Electrospinning Nanofiber Membranes with pH&#8208;regulated Ion Gating for Tunable Osmotic Power Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels existing in organisms are critical for many biological processes. Inspired by biological ion channels, the heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENM) with functional ion channels are constructed by electrospinning technology. The HENM successfully realizes ion&#8208;gating effects, which can be used for tunable energy conversions. Introduction of pyridine and carboxylic acid groups into the HENM plays an important role in generating unique and stable ion transport behaviors, in which gates become alternative states of open and close, responding to symmetric/asymmetric pH stimulations. Then we used the HENM to convert osmotic energy into electric energy which reach a maximum value up to 12.34 W m&#8208;2 and the output power density of HENM&#8208;based system could be regulated by ion&#8208;gating effects. The properties of the HENM provide widespread potentials in application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional methods for fabricating multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are often cumbersome, costly, and limited by poor adhesion between layers. Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, here, we report an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2&#8208;&#948; (CGO) thin layers rooted in the parent multilayered ceramic membranes by only one firing step. The CGO dense layers are very thin, and adhered strongly to the parent support layer, ensuring low ionic transport resistance and structural integrity of the multilayered membranes. When using as an oxygen permeable membrane for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen, it shows very long durability in harsh conditions containing H2O, CH4, H2, CO2 and H2S. Furthermore, our approach is highly scalable and applicable to a wide variety of ion conducting thin layers, including Y0.08Zr0.92O2&#8208;&#948;, Ce0.9Sm0.1O2&#8208;&#948; and Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8208;&#948;.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500 hours at 1 mA/cm2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5 mg/cm2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88% (1 C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Hydrosilylation to Access Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies on the&#160;construction of enantiomerically pure silicon&#8208;stereogenic&#160;silanes&#160;generally relies on desymmetrization of prochiral and symmetric substrates. However, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of organosilicon compounds have remained underdeveloped and unforeseen owing to a lack of an effective method for deracemization of the static silicon stereocenters. Here we report the first Rh&#8208;catalyzed&#160;dynamic kinetic&#160;asymmetric&#160;intramolecular&#160;hydrosilylation&#160;(DyKAH) with &#8220;silicon&#8208;centered&#8221;&#160;racemichydrosilanes&#160;that enables the facile preparation of silicon&#8208;stereogenic&#160;benzosiloles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.&#160;The special rhodium catalyst controlled by non&#8208;diastereopure&#8208;type mixed phosphine&#8208;phosphoramidite&#160;ligand with&#160;axial chirality and multiple stereocenters can induce enantioselectivity efficiently in this&#160;novel&#160;DyKAH reaction.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the amide moiety in chiral ligand plays important role&#160;in&#160;facilitating the SN2 substitution of chloride ion to realize the chiral inversion of silicon center.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Density Overcomes Steric Hindrance of Ferrocene Surfactant in Switchable Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ferrocene surfactant can be switched between single and double head form (FcN+C12/Fc+N+C12) triggered by redox reactions. FcN+C12 can neither stabilize an O/W emulsion alone nor an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion in combination with alumina nanoparticles due to the steric hindrance of the ferrocene group. However, such steric hindrance can be overcome by increasing the charge density in Fc+N+C12, so that oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions can be co&#8208;stabilized by the Fc+N+C12 and alumina nanoparticles at very low concentrations (1&#215;10&#8208;7 M (~50 ppb) and 0.001 wt.%, respectively). Not only reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions could be achieved by redox reactions, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be obtained through reversing the charge of alumina particles by adjusting the pH. The results provide a new protocol for the design of surfactants for stabilization of smart oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternately &#960;&#8208;Stacked Systems Assisted by o&#8208;Carborane: Dual Excimer Emission and Color Modulation by Bcage&#8211;Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we report unique solid&#8208;state excimer emission of three types of acridine&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carboranes with variable degrees of methylation at the o&#8208;carborane unit. They all showed columnar packing structures based on a dimer formation, and two types of &#960;&#8208;overlapping motifs were alternately stacked. From the photoluminescence (PL) measurements with the crystalline samples, it was found that three types of luminescent bands can simultaneously appear; monomer emission, excimer emission from the moderately &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the widely &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit. Consequently, the PL colors were drastically changed by the steric effect by methyl groups, showing a strong correlation between &#960;&#8208;overlapping fashion and excimer character. In addition, variable&#8208;temperature PL measurements revealed that these PL species should be in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, and the intensity ratios were sensitive toward temperature changes. Finally, we observed thermochromic luminescent properties from the crystalline samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, while relevant enantioselective synthetic methods are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective bio&#8208;thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides at preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43% isolated yield and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee). The large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the bio&#8208;thionation strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin polarization in CoSx loading on carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning method regulate LiPS conversion reaction. The external magnetic field induces electron spin polarization in CoSx, reducing electron repulsion, and enhancing the degree of 2p&#8211;3d orbital hybridization, thus accelerating the conversion ability of lithium polysulfides and enabling carbon nanofiber/CoSx/S cathodes with unprecedented performance and stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8722;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084&#8201;% per cycle decay rate at 2&#8197;C during 8150&#8197;cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy&#8208;efficient separation of alkane isomers for gasoline upgrading using Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with auxetic reentrant pore structures is reported by Dan Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211808). The honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows of the pore structure lead to a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and to high capacities for other isomers.

         <dc:description>Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials as photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3  (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of ~6.4 &#956;C cm&#8208;2  and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (F  V  =1.0&#215;10&#8208;2  cm2  &#956;C&#8208;1  and  F  D  =7.1&#215;10  &#8208;5  Pa&#8208;1/2  ). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in  1  , which cover UV (266 nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950 nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical bandgap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of high&#8208;value fuels and plastics starting from small hydrocarbon molecules plays a central role in the current transition towards renewable energy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving the growth of hydrocarbon chains remain to a large extent still unknown. Here we investigated the formation of hydrocarbon chains resulting from acetylene polymerization on a Ni(111) model catalyst surface. Exploiting X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy up to near&#8208;ambient pressures, the intermediate species and reaction products have been identified. Complementary  in&#8208;situ  scanning tunneling microscopy observations shed light onto the C&#8209;C coupling mechanism. While the step edges of the metal catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for the C&#8209;C coupling, we showed that the polymerization occurs instead on the flat terraces of the metallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations and Implications for Catalysis of Quasi&#8208;d10 Configurations in Formal Gold(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several gold +I and +III complexes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically, focusing on the d&#8208;configuration and physical oxidation state of the metal center. Density functional theory calculations reveal the non&#8208;negligible electron&#8208;sharing covalent character of the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#963;&#8208;bonding framework. The bonding scenarios of gold(III) are shown to be isoelectronic to the formal copper(III) complex [Cu(CF3)4]1&#8208;, in which the metal center attempts to populate its formally unoccupied 3d&#173;x2&#8208;y2 orbital via &#963;&#8209;bonding, which has been used to support the idea of an inverted ligand field, resulting in a reduced d10 Cu(I) description. However, we use Au L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to show that excitation into the d&#8208;orbital manifold of the gold(III) complexes is still possible, demonstrating that a genuine d10 configuration is not achieved. We also find increased electron&#8208;sharing nature of the &#963;&#8209;bonds in the gold(I) species, relative to their silver(I) and copper(I) analogues, due to the low&#8208;lying 6s orbital. Based on the identified bonding motifs, we identify two distinct modes of action relevant to gold catalysis. We propose that these lead to gold +I and +III complexes forming similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to either participation of the 5d&#173;x2&#8208;y2 or 6s orbital in bonding, respectively. This sheds light on why gold complexes in these two oxidation states often exhibit similar reactivity. We reflect on the implications of this analysis for the future of gold(III) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Waste plastics represent major environmental and economic burdens due to their ubiquity, slow breakdown rates, and inadequacy of current recycling routes. Polyethylenes are particularly problematic, because they lack robust recycling approaches despite being the most abundant plastics in use today. We report a novel chemical and biological approach for the rapid conversion of polyethylenes into structurally complex and pharmacologically active compounds. We present conditions for aerobic, catalytic digestion of polyethylenes collected from post&#8208;consumer and oceanic waste streams, creating carboxylic diacids that can then be used as a carbon source by the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. As a proof of principle, we have engineered strains of A. nidulans to synthesize the fungal secondary metabolites asperbenzaldehyde, citreoviridin, and mutilin when grown on these digestion products. This hybrid approach considerably expands the catalog of products to which polyethylenes can be upcycled.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Europium for Operando Catalyst Thermometry in an Exothermic Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Often the reactor or the reaction medium temperature is reported in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, even though it could vary significantly from the reactive catalyst temperature. The influence of the catalyst temperature on the catalytic performance and vice versa is therefore not always accurately known. We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for operando temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16 &#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set&#8208;up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of operando catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Fabrication and Visualization of Multiblock Microstructures
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent multiblock microcolumns are fabricated relying on the cooperation between the controllable host&#8208;guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and AIEgen guest and the hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on CB[8], NaBr and AIEgen guest. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly to be visualized, understood, and regulated.







Abstract
Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, bottom&#8208;up molecular strategies to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures are rare. Herein, we propose a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns containing 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and an AIEgen guest. Through the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guests (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of the sodium cation to the CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guests in salt solutions, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblocks to be visualized, understood, and regulated.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the selective activation of amides has flourished over the last decades. In the past four years, this area has become a rapidly developing domain. This Minireview aims to highlight the breakthroughs in amide activation achieved since 2018, with a focus on significant advances in electrophilic and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed amide activation, as well as other strategies on amide activation and functionalisation.







Abstract
In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programmes focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This Minireview comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine&#8208;tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine&#8208;tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials.

     alt="Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine-tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self-healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine-tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this Review proposes strategies for tailoring the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials through both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>

         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS&#8208;catalysts affect anti&#8208;crotylation of primary alcohols mediated by methylallene or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to provide polyketide propionate motifs. These C&#8722;C bond formations are byproduct&#8208;free and can be conducted in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of anti&#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide&#8197;B (C9&#8211;C15) and leucascandrolide&#8197;A (C9&#8211;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet wave functions of BODIPY dimers with symmetrically structured ethynylene or butadienylene linker are highly localized on one BODIPY moiety, which differs from previous findings for meso&#8208;to&#8208;meso porphyrin oligomers. This study provides a new understanding of triplet state confinement and molecular symmetry.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne/butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12&#8211;14&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemisorbing a prototypical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon unravels by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analysed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganisation can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalisation of surfaces with carbenes.

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast photodynamics of a dithienylethene&#8208;based coordination cage have been shown to vary depending on the nature of the encapsulated guest molecules. The ring&#8208;closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the 3MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage's photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired guest compounds.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled Identification of 4&#8208;Oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactams as Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidases 8 and 9</title>

         <dc:description>
Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

Upon the introduction of optimal-content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; underwent a volcano-type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water-gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <title>Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions&#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. This behavior was observed in a new family of squaramides that self&#8208;assemble into particles at room temperature and undergo a reversible morphological transformation into fibers by cooling the sample.&#160;This transformation is triggered by a molecular rearrangement of the aggregated system implying a change in the squaramide hydrogen bonding pattern.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.

This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Atomic Pairs with a Distal Fe3+&#8208;Site Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8722;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair, bound to a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Lewis acidic Fe center as the distal to the surface, boosted water oxidation. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies

         <dc:description>
New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful to studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H addition of N-unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;-aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N-unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;-C&#8722;H addition of N-unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;-aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;times (from p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;42.6 to p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

&lt;p&gt;From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron-based framework material is assembled with potential for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from natural gas and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture from industrial off-gas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron-based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off-gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively, enabling its capability for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from light alkanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Complex of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as the electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries application.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo&#8208;oligomerization; 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of stacked aromatic assemblies has been developed, in which the remote heteroannular site over the proximal homoannular site is functionalized. Mechanistic investigations support an olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversification of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular ortho C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.
