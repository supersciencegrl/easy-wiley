      <title>Fine&#8208;tuning protein self&#8208;organization by orthogonal chemo&#8208;optogenetic tools</title>
      <dc:description>A universal gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach for the spatiotemporal control of protein activity is highly desirable when reconstituting biological modules  in vitro  . Here we used orthogonal translation with a photocaged amino acid as an optogenetic tool to map and elucidate molecular mechanisms in the self&#8208;organization of the prokaryotic filamentous cell division protein (FtsZ). This protein is highly relevant for the assembly of the division ring in bacteria, and displays intriguing circular treadmilling dynamics when reconstituted on membranes in vitro. We masked a tyrosine residue of FtsZ by site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged tyrosine analog. While the mutant still shows self&#8208;assembly into filaments, dynamic self&#8208;organization into ring patterns can no longer be observed. UV&#8208;mediated uncaging revealed that tyrosine 222 is essential for the regulation of the protein&#8217;s GTPase activity, self&#8208;organization and treadmilling dynamics. Thus, the light&#8208;mediated assembly of functional protein modules appears to be a promising minimal regulation strategy for building up molecular complexity towards a minimal cell.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer
(EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report here a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper.

We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs is comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes.

      <title>Hydrazine (N2H4) Formation via Coupling of a NiIII&#8208;NH2 Radical</title>
      <dc:description>M(NH  x  ) intermediates involved in N&#8211;N bond formation are central to ammonia oxidation (AO) catalysis, an enabling technology to ultimately exploit ammonia (NH  3  ) as an alternative fuel source. While homocoupling of a terminal amide species (M&#8211;NH  2  ) to form hydrazine (N  2  H  4  ) has been proposed, well&#8208;defined examples are without precedent. Herein, we discuss the generation and electronic structure of a Ni  III  &#8211;NH  2  species that undergoes bimolecular coupling to generate a Ni  II  2  (N  2  H  4  ) complex. This hydrazine adduct can be further oxidized to a structurally unusual Ni  2  (N  2  H  2  ) species; the latter releases N  2  in the presence of NH  3  , thus establishing a synthetic cycle for Ni&#8208;mediated AO. Distribution of the redox load for H  2  N&#8211;NH  2  formation via NH  2  coupling between two metal centers presents an attractive strategy for AO catalysis using Earth&#8208;abundant, late first&#8208;row metals.</dc:description>

Distribution of the redox load for H  2  N&#8211;NH  2  formation via NH  2  coupling between two metal centers presents an attractive strategy for AO catalysis using Earth&#8208;abundant, late first&#8208;row metals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Pathway and Length Control of Supramolecular Polymers in Aqueous Media via a Hydrogen Bonding Lock</title>
      <dc:description>Programming the organization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems into nanostructures of defined dimensions is an essential but challenging requirement for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high&#8208;precision control over the self&#8208;assembly pathways and fiber length of an amphiphilic BODIPY dye in aqueous media by exploiting a programmable hydrogen bonding lock. The presence of a (2&#8209;hydroxyethyl) amide group in the target BODIPY enables different types of intra&#8208;  vs  . intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to a competition between kinetically controlled discoidal H&#8208;type aggregates and thermodynamically controlled 1D J&#8208;type fibers in water. The high stability of the kinetic state, which is dominated by the hydrophobic effect, is reflected in the slow transformation to the thermodynamic product (several weeks at room temperature).  However, this lag time can be suppressed by the addition of seeds from the thermodynamic species, enabling us to obtain supramolecular polymers of tuneable length in water for multiple cycles  . In our view, the introduction of programmable hydrogen bonds in water further broadens the scope of controlled supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioorthogonal Activation of Dual Catalytic and Anti&#8208;Cancer Activities of Organogold(I) Complexes in Living Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Controllably activating the bio&#8208;reactivity of metal complexes in living systems is challenging but highly desirable because it can minimize off&#8208;target bindings and improve spatiotemporal specificity. Herein we report a new bioorthogonal activation approach by employing Pd(II)&#8208;triggered transmetallation reactions to conditionally activate the bio&#8208;reactivity of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes (e.g.,  1a  ) in vitro and in vivo. A combination of  1  H NMR, LC&#8208;MS, DFT calculation and fluorescence screening assays reveals that  1a  displays a reasonable stability against biological thiols, but its phenylacetylide ligand can be efficiently transferred to Pd(II), leading to in situ formation of labile NHC&#8208;Au(I) species that is catalytically active inside living cells and zebrafish, and can meanwhile effectively suppress the activity of thioredoxin reductase, potently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and efficiently suppress angiogenesis in zebrafish models. Of note, by introducing RGD&#8208;functionalized Pd(II) inducers,  1a  is endowed with highly selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells with minimal influence on the normal counterparts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Proximal noncovalent forces are commonplace in natural systems and understanding the consequences of their juxtaposition is critical. This paper experimentally quantifies for the first time a Hydrogen Bond enhanced Halogen Bond (HBeXB) without the complexities of protein structure or preorganization. An HBeXB is a halogen bond that has been strengthened when the halogen donor simultaneously accepts a hydrogen bond. Our theoretical studies suggest that electron&#8208;rich halogen bond donors are strengthened most by an adjacent hydrogen bond. Furthermore, stronger hydrogen bond donors enhance the halogen bond the most. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of halide complexes (X&#8212; = Br&#8212;, I&#8212;) reveal that HBeXBs produce shorter halogen bonds than non&#8208;hydrogen bond analogues. 19F NMR titrations with chloride highlight that the HBeXB analogue exhibits stronger binding. Together, these results form the foundation for future studies concerning hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in close proximity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free thiyl radical&#8208;mediated activation of alkanes is described.

      <title>Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
      <dc:description>Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as themoelectics, thermal barrier coating, etc. Herein, crystal structure and transport properties of Cu  4  TiSe  4  is reported.Cu  4  TiSe  4  is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19 W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity(k  L  ) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu which partially hybridized with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoid crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reaches the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu  4  TiSe  4  could also open the route for the finding of efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, providing that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.</dc:description>

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8208;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298 nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n&#160;= 0.348 at 546 nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722;&#160;and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy, and promote their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanism of Pd&#8208;catalyzed "CO&#8208;free"&#160;Carbonylation Reaction Uncovered by In&#8209;situ Spectroscopy: The Formyl Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>&#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions, where synthesis gas (CO/H2) is substituted by C1 surrogate molecules like formaldehyde or formic acid, have received wide spread attention in homogeneous catalysis lately. Although a broad range of organics is available via this method, still relatively little is known about the precise reaction mechanism. In this work, we used in&#8208;situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to unravel the mechanism of the alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes using different surrogate molecules. In contrast to previous hypotheses no carbon monoxide could be found during the reaction. Instead the reaction proceeds via the C&#8209;H activation of in&#8209;situ generated methyl formate. On the basis of quantitative NMR experiments, a kinetic model involving all major intermediates is built which enables the knowledge&#8208;driven optimization of the reaction. Finally, a new reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of in&#8208;situ observed Pd&#8208;hydride, Pd&#8208;formyl and Pd&#8208;acyl species.</dc:description>

      <title>Vinyl and Alkynyl Triazenes: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Vinyl and alkynyl triazenes have emerged as highly versatile reagents in organic synthesis. The electron&#8208;donating character of the triazene function activates the triple bond of alkynyl triazenes, thereby facilitating addition, cyclization, annulation and rearrangement reactions. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, are convenient precursors for vinyl cations, and they can be converted via addition reactions into alkyl triazenes.







Abstract
Aromatic compounds containing triazenyl groups (N3RR&#8242;) have a profound impact on synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In contrast, the chemistry of vinyl and alkynyl triazenes was a largely uncharted territory until recently. The situation has changed over the last five years, and it has become apparent that vinyl and alkynyl triazenes are highly interesting compounds with a unique reactivity. The electron&#8208;donating properties of the triazenyl group provide alkynyl triazenes with an ynamide&#8208;like reactivity, which can be exploited in reactions of the triple bond. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, can be used for electrophilic vinylation reactions. The foundation for this new triazene chemistry are synthetic pathways which allow preparing vinyl and alkynyl triazenes in few steps from readily available starting materials. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in this area.

      <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>The coverage of surface ligands has important influence on the formation, structure and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.  Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster [Ag  78  (  i  PrPhS)  30  (dppm)  10  Cl  10  ]  4+  (  SD/Ag78a  ; dppm = bis&#8208;(diphenyphosphino)methane) that is synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]  n  as precursor (Hpz = pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.  SD/Ag78a  shows a core&#8208;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag  53  kernel surrounded by an Ag  25  discontinuous metal&#8208;organic shell. The Ag  53  kernel is an Ag  13  Inodecahedron encaged by an Ag  40  drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag  25  shell consists of two Ag  10  S  10  P  10  Cl  5  rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag  78  nanocluster, forming diverse metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures such as  S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples, Cl&#8208;capped Ag  3  trigons and S&#8208;capped Ag  4  tetragons.  This nanocluster is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible region with a maximum around 493 nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from  SD/Ag78a  through intercluster C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment. This work not only reveals the complicated surface chemistry of silver nanocluster but also provides a promising ternary ligand strategy for the syntheses of them.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrathin Porous Carbon Nitride Bundles with an Adjustable Energy Band Structure toward Simultaneous Solar Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Selective Phenylcarbinol Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Rational design of photocatalysts with multiple functions, including organic synthesis and water&#8208;splitting, is promising and challenging. Herein, we synthesized actiniae&#8208;like carbon nitride (ACN) bundles based on the pyrolysis of an asymmetric supramolecular precursor prepared from L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) and melamine. ACN has adjustable band gaps (2.25 eV ~ 2.75 eV) and hollow microtubes with ultrathin pore walls, which enrich reaction sites, improve visible&#8208;light absorption and enhance charge separation. In the presence of phenylcarbinol, ACN exhibited excellent pure water&#8208;splitting ability (95.3 &#956;mol/h) and in the meanwhile phenylcarbinol was selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde (conversion of 90.9%, selectivity of 99.7%) under solar irradiation. For the concurrent reactions,  2  D isotope labeling, separation and detection were conducted to confirm that the proton source of released hydrogen is water. Further, we theorized the mechanism of water splitting and phenylcarbinol oxidation and hope that it provides inspiration for simultaneous utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in one system.</dc:description>

      <title>Inverting the enantiopreference of nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles by reshaping the binding pocket with a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles is an attractive method for the synthesis of chiral cyanocarboxylic acids, the precursors to pharmaceutically important g&#8208;amino acids. However, the tested nitrilases towards 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or aryl substituted glutaronitriles mostly generate ( S  )&#8208;configurated cyanocarboxylic acids. Herein a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy, i.e. symmetry analysis of substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis  sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile ( 1a  ). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion ( S  , 90% ee  to R  , 47% ee  ). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99% ee  , R  ) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure ( R  )&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid (( R  )&#8208; 2a  ), and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other classes of enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups, that are often desirable in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence of Highly Anharmonic Soft Lattice Vibrations in Zintl Rattler</title>
      <dc:description>Phonons are collective excitations from a periodic lattice and are the primary carriers of heat in an insulating crystalline solid. The extent of periodicity in a crystalline lattice is ensured by local chemical bonding, thereby, understanding the correlation between local structure and lattice dynamics is crucial in realizing intrinsically low thermal conductivity. Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe  2  , which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46 &#8208; 0.31 W/mK) in the 300&#8208;673 K. We established an intrinsic rattling nature in TlInTe  2  by studying the local structure and phonon vibrations using synchrotron X&#8208;ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) (100 &#8211; 503 K) and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) (5 &#8211; 450 K), respectively. We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded [InTe2](&#8208;n) (n)&#160; transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ~30 cm  &#8208;1  inside distorted Thompson cage formed by&#160;[InTe2](&#8208;n) (n) . This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value ~0.66(6) ps, which resulted ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe  2  .</dc:description>

We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded [InTe2](&#8208;n) (n)&#160; transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ~30 cm  &#8208;1  inside distorted Thompson cage formed by&#160;[InTe2](&#8208;n) (n) . This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value ~0.66(6) ps, which resulted ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Materials with multifunctionality or multi&#8208;responsiveness, especially for the polymers derived from green, renewable precursors, have recently attracted significant attention resulting from their technological impact. Nowadays, vegetable oil based waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) have been widely used in various areas,while strategies for simultaneous realization of their self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, shape memory as well as high mechanical properties are still highly anticipated. Contrary to current knowledge,we report here that a multifunctional castor oil based waterborne polyurethanes with high strength was successfully developed by employing proper amount of dithiodiphenylamine (DTDA). The networks possessed high tensile strength up to 38 MPa as well as excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency. Moreover, the WPU film with DTDA exhibited a maximum recovery of 100% virgin mechanical properties after reprocessing for 4 times. The broad glass transition temperature of the samples also endowed the films with excellent versatile shape&#8208;memory effect, including dual&#8208;to quadruple shape memory effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphine Carboxylate &#8211; Probing the Edge of Stability of a Carbon Dioxide Adduct with Dihydrogenphosphide</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH  2  with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO  &#8211;  ). In this latter transformation, a new mechanism is proposed for the electrophilic reactivity of the phosphaethynolate ion. The resulting anion is shown to be a weak but stable adduct of carbon dioxide, reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal carbon dioxide complexes. Protonation to form phosphine carboxylic acid (PH  2  COOH) and functionalization to form esters is shown to increase the strength of the P&#8211;C interaction, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between this species and the analogous carbamic (NH  2  COOH) and carbonic acids (H  2  CO  3  ). Functionalization of the oxygen atom is found to stabilize the phosphine carboxylate while also allowing solubility in organic solvents whereas phosphorus functionalization is shown to facilitate decarboxylation. Substituent migration occurs in some cases.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Functionalized with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Robust and Conductive Ligands to Stabilize Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Due to their excellent stability and conductivity,  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have attracted great attention as versatile ligands for the functionalization of macroscopic gold surfaces. Recently, NHCs are explored as anchor groups to bind organic ligands to colloidal gold (i.e. gold nanoparticles, Au NPs), yet these efforts are confined to non&#8208;conjugated ligands so far &#8211; i.e. focused solely on exploiting the stability aspect. Using NHCs to link Au NPs and electronically active organic components, e.g. conjugated polymers (CPs), will allow capitalizing on both the stability as well as the inherent conductivity of the NHC anchors. Here, we report three types of Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) complexes, which, when used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophenes)&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au (P3HTs&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au) with narrow molecular weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained  via  direct reduction, and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface, resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison with P3HT&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au. This work demonstrates for the first time that CPs functionalized with NHCs can serve as ligands for the stabilization of Au NPs, paving a way for potential (opto&#8208;)electronical applications of CP&#8208;NHC@Au NP nanomaterials.</dc:description>

Here, we report three types of Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) complexes, which, when used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophenes)&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au (P3HTs&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au) with narrow molecular weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained  via  direct reduction, and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface, resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison with P3HT&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au. This work demonstrates for the first time that CPs functionalized with NHCs can serve as ligands for the stabilization of Au NPs, paving a way for potential (opto&#8208;)electronical applications of CP&#8208;NHC@Au NP nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Pairwise Proximity&#8208;differentiated Visualization of Single&#8208;cell DNA Epigenetic Marks</title>
      <dc:description>Spatial positioning and proximity of DNA epigenetic marks are fundamental to a deeper understanding of gene regulation and chromatin architecture. However, it remains poorly explored and technically challenging. Here we report pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization of single&#8208;cell 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). These two marks on chromatin in fixed cells are successively labeled and crosslinked with their DNA primer probes via click chemistry. Based on a pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated mechanism, proximal 5fC/5hmC sites firstly and residual 5fC or 5hmC sites then are encoded with respective circularized barcodes. These barcodes are simultaneously amplified for multiplexed single&#8208;molecule imaging. Thus we demonstrate differentiated visualization of 5fC or 5hmC spatial positioning and their pairwise proximity in single cells. Such multi&#8208;level subcellular information may provide insights into regulation functions and mechanisms of chromatin modifications, and the spatial proximity can expose the potential crosstalk or interaction between their reader proteins.</dc:description>

DHP compounds exhibit chirality&#8208;specific antagonistic or agonistic effects. The structure of rabbit Ca  v  1.1 bound to an achiral drug nifedipine reveals the general binding mode for DHP drugs, but the molecular basis for chiral specificity remains elusive. Here, we report five cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Ca  v  1.1 in the presence of the bestselling drug amlodipine, a DHP antagonist (  R  )&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and a titration of its agonistic enantiomer (  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bay K8644 at resolutions of 2.9&#8208;3.4 &#197;. The amlodipine&#8208;bound structure reveals the molecular basis for the high efficacy of the drug. All structures with the addition of the Bay K8644 enantiomers exhibit similar inactivated conformations, suggesting that (  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bay K8644, when acting as an agonist, is insufficient to lock the activated state of the channel for a prolonged duration.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites via engineering atomic configuration is an effective strategy to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but still remains challenging because of the lack of rational guidance and effective methods. Here, we demonstrate the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and ORR performance by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis.

As predicted, Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920 V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current and ultralow Tafel slope of 31 mV dec &#8208;1  , exceeding the Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts. Even in more challenging acidic media, the ORR kinetics of Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC still surpasses that of Pt/C.

      <title>Bunsen the Geochemist: Icelandic Volcanism, Geyser Theory, and Gas, Rock and Mineral Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Bunsen classified volcanic rocks in two types, trachytic and pyroxenic (today felsic and mafic) based on their chemical analyses. He explained the mechanism of geyser action. He refuted the widespread idea that volcanoes and geysers were connected with the sea, and that masses of common salt were produced in eruptions. He pioneered gas analysis by means of the eudiometer. He was a vehement inductive empiricist, vigorously rejecting hypotheses.







Abstract
Following the eruption of Hekla in 1845&#8211;1846 Bunsen was invited by King Christian VIII of Denmark and Iceland to participate in a geochemical expedition to Iceland together with the geologist Sartorius von Waltershausen and the physiologist Carl Bergmann from G&#246;ttingen. The French mineralogist Des Cloizeaux went to Iceland separately and joined the expedition. The eudiometer invented by Bunsen was crucial for his accurate characterization of volcanic gases and determination of the composition of mixtures. His analyses of the chemical compositions of numerous rocks and minerals led him to the classification of two fundamental rock types, the more silica rich (nowadays called felsic) and the less silica rich, more basic (mafic) in agreement with Des Cloizeaux and the Danish scientist J.&#8197;C. Schythe. Bunsen also formulated the correct mechanism of geyser action and helped disband the theory of connections between geysers, volcanoes and the sea. He disagreed vehemently with Waltershausen over the mechanisms of formation of sal ammoniac and of volcanic rocks and their chemical compositions. He revealed himself as an ardent experimentalist vigorously opposed to hypotheses of any kind, which also made him dismiss the new chemical theories, for example, those of Dumas and Kekul&#233;.

     alt="Bunsen the Geochemist: Icelandic Volcanism, Geyser Theory, and Gas, Rock and Mineral Analyses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunsen classified volcanic rocks in two types, trachytic and pyroxenic (today felsic and mafic) based on their chemical analyses. He explained the mechanism of geyser action. He refuted the widespread idea that volcanoes and geysers were connected with the sea, and that masses of common salt were produced in eruptions. He pioneered gas analysis by means of the eudiometer. He was a vehement inductive empiricist, vigorously rejecting hypotheses.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the eruption of Hekla in 1845&#8211;1846 Bunsen was invited by King Christian VIII of Denmark and Iceland to participate in a geochemical expedition to Iceland together with the geologist Sartorius von Waltershausen and the physiologist Carl Bergmann from G&#246;ttingen. The French mineralogist Des Cloizeaux went to Iceland separately and joined the expedition. The eudiometer invented by Bunsen was crucial for his accurate characterization of volcanic gases and determination of the composition of mixtures. His analyses of the chemical compositions of numerous rocks and minerals led him to the classification of two fundamental rock types, the more silica rich (nowadays called felsic) and the less silica rich, more basic (mafic) in agreement with Des Cloizeaux and the Danish scientist J.&#8197;C. Schythe. Bunsen also formulated the correct mechanism of geyser action and helped disband the theory of connections between geysers, volcanoes and the sea. He disagreed vehemently with Waltershausen over the mechanisms of formation of sal ammoniac and of volcanic rocks and their chemical compositions. He revealed himself as an ardent experimentalist vigorously opposed to hypotheses of any kind, which also made him dismiss the new chemical theories, for example, those of Dumas and Kekul&#233;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sublimable Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes: From Spin&#8208;State Switching to Molecular Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals&#8212;A Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8197;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>
For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principals. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters. The technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction, as well as the use of ionic liquids.







Abstract
For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.
