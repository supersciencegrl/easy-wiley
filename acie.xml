         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8211;COCl Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8211;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8211;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride  in situ  . The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intragenomic decarboxylation of 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleotides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three further dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC, (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC) and finally 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intra&#8208;genomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. Here, we show using metabolic labelling in several cell types that cadC decarboxylates, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8208;C bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Nanoflower Assisted Separation&#8208;free Nucleic Acid Detection Platform with Commercial Pregnancy Test Strip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious and human diseases. Herein we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strip (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#160;associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2 copies/&#956;L. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes which utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Strain Mapping of Late&#8208;Transition Metal High&#8208;Index Facets Nanoparticle for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects to catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterization of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;splicing strategy to construct a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity, on&#8208;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe  HHC  for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720 nm after UGT1A1 metabolism.  HHC  was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals, and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function. This practical &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; is particularly powerful in developing highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate removal from water with low pollution concentration and its subsequent electroreduction to higher&#8208;value ammonia is becoming progressively essential. However, this process still suffers from low selectivity and activity due to slow mass transfer of nitrate and the induced limited reagent supply to reaction interface. Herein, we demonstrate that a built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO  3  &#8211;  ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO  3  RR). A model electrocatalyst are created by stacking CuCl&#160;(111) and rutile TiO  2  (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO  2  to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Molecular dynamics simulation and finite element analysis suggest that this built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO  3  &#8211;  ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also rises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower down energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH  3  product selectivity of 98.6%, a low NO  2  &#8211;  production of &lt;0.6%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4 h  &#8211;1  is achieved with this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, which are all the best among studies reported at 100 mg L  &#8211;1  of nitrate concentration to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;Bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform polymer nanoparticles were constructed by green emulsion polymerization, overcoming the disadvantage of large &#960;&#8208;bond conjugation while keeping many triple bonds to realize stimulated Raman scattering imaging. 15 distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations were achieved by Raman shift/intensity encoding in the biological silence region (1800&#8211;2800&#8197;cm&#8722;1), thus providing a tool for high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial fingerprint output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable symmetric surfaces were used to develop aggregation&#8208;induced emissive CD polymer gels with reversible two&#8208;switch&#8208;mode fluorescence (blue dispersed fluorescence and red AIE), followed by the fabrication of anisotropic swimming robots showing octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and autonomous locomotion on the water surface.







Abstract
Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol and Phenyl Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry is used to generate polyphenols from small molecules and biological macromolecules containing phenolic groups, enabling the subsequent coordination of the polyphenols with metal ions to engineer coatings on a variety of substrates.







Abstract
We report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412&#8197;kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional .OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives and different metal ions including FeII, FeIII, CuII, and CoII. In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. The properties of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for surface engineering.

         <title>Direct Detection of Surface Species Formed on Iridium Electrocatalysts during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to directly examine the oxidation state and surface composition of nanosized Ir electrodes after oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was developed. Atom probe tomography reveals compositional changes in the topmost surface and subsurface on various Ir planes during OER. This approach provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into surface changes during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. Herein, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8722;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8722;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8722;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.

It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of amidines has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers. A wide range of benzimidazole derivatives containing N&#8722;C axial chirality can be conveniently constructed in excellent yields and enantioselectivities by intramolecular amination.







Abstract
N&#8722;C Biaryl atropisomers are prevalent in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers by stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy is presented for the synthesis of N&#8722;C axially chiral biaryl molecules. A broad spectrum of N&#8722;C axially chiral compounds was obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.

         <title>Picomole&#8208;Scale Synthesis and Screening of Macrocyclic Compound Libraries by Acoustic Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach has been developed for synthesizing and screening large libraries of macrocyclic compounds at a picomole scale. The macrocycles were synthesized by combinatorially transferring reagents in 2.5&#8197;nL droplets to microwell plates using acoustic waves. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a library of 2700 macrocyclic compounds was synthesized and potent inhibitors of the protein&#8211;protein interaction p53&#8211;MDM2 were identified.







Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale by using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced the reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8211;p53 protein&#8211;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our approach based on acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy for the development of macrocycle ligands.

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as cis alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO2, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.

         <title>Template Guiding for the Encapsulation of Uniformly Subnanometric Platinum Clusters in Beta&#8208;Zeolites Enabling High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;guidance protocol was reported for the synthesis of subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite. The metal ions are guided to the internal channels of the zeolite template through electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H&#8208;beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.

         <title>Light&#8208;Switchable Buffers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that protonated merocyanines can act as reversible photoacids even when buffered with NaOH, attaining tunable and fully reversible jumps of up to 3 pH units between pH&#8197;7 and 4.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;switchable buffer system based on a merocyanine photoacid is presented. Para&#8208;substitution of the indolium side with a methoxy group affords a compound suitable for making hydrolytically stable aqueous buffers whose pH can be tuned between 7 and 4 using 500&#8197;nm light.

         <title>Chiral Distorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes Bearing a Nonagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger the ring, the better the chiroptical properties: A new family of highly distorted nanographenes is presented incorporating for the first time a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle. The nonagon&#8208;containing [5]helicene results in an extremely twisted helical moiety and provides to the final chiral PAHs with enhanced chiroptical properties.







Abstract
A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs|=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.

         <title>Diarylethene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Inhibitors of Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic diarylethene&#8208;containing analogues of the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1) can modulate activity of serine proteases in the nanomolar&#8211;micromolar range in highly efficient photocontrollable manner.







Abstract
A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease Bos taurus trypsin&#8197;1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule&#8212;sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1)&#8212;we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with Ki in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17&#8197;SFTI&#8208;1 analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8211;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Ni&#8208;based Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and  in situ  experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion.&#160;The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ~5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;S bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties, thus drawing attention. However, the development of new (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)  n  &#8208;structured CPs is hindered by their crystallization difficulty. Herein, we use machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H  3  ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8211;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag  2  Httc]  n  , features a 3D extended infinite Ag&#8211;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag  2  Httc]  n  is highly photoconductive (  &#966;  &#931;  &#956;  max  = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs difficult to crystallize with selective topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve Exceptionally High Iodine Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I  2  ) capture is of great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. Here we employ a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I  2  capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits static I  2  uptake capacity of 10.21 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at 75 &#176;C, and dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at ~400 ppm of I  2  and 25 &#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. It also shows fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I  2  adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving high I  2  capture performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a Tb(III)&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly desirable to develop high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, especially those based on the fluorescence intensity enhancement (also known as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;) sensing. It is the same and more challenging for lanthanide materials, on account of the difficulty to sensitize the metal&#8208;chromophores in a desired way. Herein, guided by a&#160; &#8220; second&#8208;sphere interaction &#8221; strategy, we synthesized a polyamine&#8208;derived hexa&#8208;carboxylate ligand (H  6  L) to fabricate the Tb( &#8546; )&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of methyl amine in aqueous environment with ultra&#8208;low detection limit&#160; and high turn&#8208;on efficiency . MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with a secondary coordination sphere that is densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Through H&#8208;bond interactions on second&#8208;coordination sphere, nonradiative pathways were suppressed as a result of binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand, thereby leading to luminescence enhancement. Such &#8220;remote&#8221; interacting mechanism involved in the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the guest@MMCF&#8208;4 and molecular dynamic simulation studies. For the first time, &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of organic analytes in aqueous media was achieved via the rational design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb (III) in Ln&#8208;MOFs. Our study contributes a new and promising design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing for not only lanthanide MOFs, but also luminescent materials driven by other metal chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn  0.3  Ga  0.7  S  2  . We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite&#8217;s performance and its surface&#8217;s chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial to achieve high activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity relationships in nonenzymatic template&#8208;directed RNA synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a  3  E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single electron transfer process and is autocatalyzed by  in situ  &#8208;generated ZnX  2  . The reaction rate is amplified by three&#8208;fold through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated TdT&#8208;catalyzed polymerization enables the programmable, site&#8208;specific modification of DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes of different heights and compositions. The brush layer protects the origami core from nuclease degradation, which enables the application of DNA origami&#8208;based nanostructures for smart drug delivery and other biomedical applications.







Abstract
Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized DNA nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.

         <title>Schottky Barrier&#8208;Induced Surface Electric Field Boosts Universal Reduction of NOx&#8722; in Water to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable surface electric field induced by Schottky barrier boosts the reduction of NOx&#8722; in water for ammonia production. The tunable amounts of Ni nanoparticles inside a nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support could gradually enhance the surface electric field for enriching and fixation of NOx&#8722; anions, rendering high Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% for ammonia production from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction.







Abstract
NOx&#8722; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8722; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NOx&#8722; anions on the electrode surface, including NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH3. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NOx&#8722; anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction. Remarkably, the NH3 yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic NO2&#8722; reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NOx&#8722; pollutants, including seawater or wastewater, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.

         <title>Sustainable Production of Benzylamines from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for the conversion of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound into benzylamines through one&#8208;pot C&#8722;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond formation with secondary amines serving as both amine sources and reducing agents was developed. The feasibility for the production of bio&#8208;based benzylamines from lignin in a two&#8208;step process was introduced in these processes.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C&#945;&#8722;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C&#946;&#8722;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Allenes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkylation/Defluorination of Propargyl Difluorides with Alkylzincs</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of propargyl difluorides, R1CF2C&#8801;CR2, with alkylzincs, R3ZnCl, giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes, R1FC=C=CR2R3, with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at the &#946;&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8208;Rh intermediate, which is generated by regioselective addition of R3&#8208;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the current study, with the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic techniques, transient kinetic analysis, and implementation of robust experimental methodologies, we resolve the nature of catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism for oxidative coupling of methane over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2&#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na&#8208;WOx sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (i) surface Na&#8208;WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over&#8208;oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.

The reduction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized organoberyllium chloride yields the first neutral beryllium radical, which was characterized by EPR, IR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations show significant spin density at beryllium and confirm donor&#8211;acceptor bonding between an alkylberyllium radical fragment and a neutral CAAC ligand.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;X nanosheet is developed as a novel free radical regulator. It shows dual&#8208;modal free radical catalysis adaptive to environment changes, enabling amplified production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions, while scavenging free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells.







Abstract
Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically, the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Cadmium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst by Tuning of the Axial Coordination Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with an optimized CdN4S1 moiety were designed and prepared. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reached 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the TOF of CO production was as high as 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1. Cd SACs are effective for reduction of CO2 to CO. Introduction of an axial coordination structure boosts the activity of CO2RR and also enhances the selectivity of CO2RR by suppressing the adsorption of *H.







Abstract
Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, it was found that Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have excellent performance in activating CO2, and the introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2 reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1 moiety incorporated in a carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type electrolysis cell, and the turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was much higher than that reported to date. This work shows a successful example of how to design highly efficient catalysts guided by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Carbonyl Hypoiodites as Extremely Strong Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl hypoiodites possess very strongly polarized iodine atoms, including what is now the largest known &#963;&#8208;hole for a neutral compound, and act as strong halogen bond donors. When strong Lewis bases, for example DMAP, are used as halogen bond acceptors, the iodine atom, for all intents and purposes, transfers from the oxygen to nitrogen atom to give an ion&#8208;pair of the general form [RCOO&#8722;][I&#8722;+N(DMAP)] with an O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N halogen bond.







Abstract
Neutral halogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes were prepared from in situ formed carbonyl hypoiodites and aromatic organic bases. The carbonyl hypoiodites have a strongly polarized iodine atom with larger &#963;&#8208;holes than any known uncharged halogen bond donor. Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen&#8208;bonded complexes where the classical O&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen&#8208;bonded COO&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N+ ion&#8208;pair (salt) with an asymmetric O&#8722;I&#8722;N moiety. X&#8208;ray analyses, NMR studies, and calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite&#8208;based O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes, confirming that in the solid&#8208;state the iodine atom is much closer to the N&#8208;atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O&#8208;atom.

         <title>Antiaromatic 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes (see structure) were synthesized and found to exhibit distinct antiaromaticity as manifested by pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
s&#8208;Indacene is a classical non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Herein, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine through a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diaryl acetylenes followed by hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, as manifested in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.

         <title>Isomerization of a cis&#8208;(2&#8208;Borylalkenyl)Gold Complex via a Retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Metalate Shift: Cleavage of a C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si Bond trans to a C&#8722;Au Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected isomerization of cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complexes, which formed through the first alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond, was observed with structural characterization of intermediates and products. Kinetic analysis for isomerization of isolated intermediate and detailed DFT calculations revealed a new elementary reaction, i.e., a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221; that contains anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination.







Abstract
This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8722;B bond of a di(o&#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221;, which can be considered as an anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step. Relative energies of the transition states to each isomer and natural&#8208;bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses were used to clearly rationalize the regiochemistry of the products.

         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in a Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7 was successfully obtained by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, which enables unprecedented passive X&#8208;ray detection with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it is challenging to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without an external power supply. However, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, we obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7. Converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite stimulates a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as an enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features show the promise of the fabrication of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at zero bias, which is even superior to the value of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Transformations of Nitrogen&#8208;Oxyanions to Ammonia via Oxoammonium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;assisted transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) in the presence of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8208;H) lead to a diaryl oxoammonium species [(TMB)2NO]+. In addition to the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative chemistry of [(TMB)2NO]+ towards oxidizable substrates, this report illustrates water&#8208;promoted decomposition of [(TMB)2NO]+ affording ammonia.







Abstract
Transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) to ammonia impart pivotal roles in sustainable biogeochemical processes. While metal&#8208;mediated reductions of NOx&#8722; are relatively well known, this report illustrates proton&#8208;assisted transformations of NOx&#8722; anions in the presence of electron&#8208;rich aromatics such as 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8722;H, 1&#8201;a) leading to the formation of diaryl oxoammonium salt [(TMB)2N+=O][NO3&#8722;] (2&#8201;a) via the intermediacy of nitrosonium cation (NO+). Detailed characterizations including UV/Vis, multinuclear NMR, FT&#8208;IR, HRMS, X&#8208;ray analyses on a set of closely related metastable diaryl oxoammonium [Ar2N+=O] species disclose unambiguous structural and spectroscopic signatures. Oxoammonium salt 2&#8201;a exhibits 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative reactivity in the presence of oxidizable substrates such as benzylamine, thiol, and ferrocene. Intriguingly, reaction of 2&#8201;a with water affords ammonia. Perhaps of broader significance, this work reveals a new metal&#8208;free route germane to the conversion of NOx&#8197;to&#8197;NH3.

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;atom deletion from N&#8208;heterocycles via N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation, Curtius&#8208;type rearrangement and rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diazene intermediates is described. It provides a unique opportunity to achieve ring contraction of (n+1)&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles to n&#8208;membered cycles.







Abstract
Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8722;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Domino Reaction Enables Fully Controlled Non&#8208;Statistical Synthesis of Hexaarylbenzene with Six Different Aryl Groups**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high yielding and scalable metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step linear domino reaction results in functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) and opens the door for making a broad variety of synthetically challenging hexaarylbenzene (HAB) molecules with six different aryl groups.







Abstract
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product&#8212;functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB)&#8212;can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to create diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIPs for protein recognition are often synthesized by the epitope approach. The epitope is a short surface&#8208;exposed peptide of the protein. Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies were used to prove the evidence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of the peptide epitope in the corresponding MIP nanogel. No binding was observed with a non&#8208;related peptide.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8220;synthetic antibody&#8221; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer&#8208;based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8220;best&#8221; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis&#8197;A Virus Cell Receptor&#8208;1 protein, also known as KIM&#8208;1 and TIM&#8208;1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified carbon nitride with O&#8208;containing linkers decorated with carbon dots selectively produces methanol from CO2 and water with the benchmark quantum yield of ca. 6&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectroscopic investigation shows that extraction of holes before trapping by the carbon dots is key for the remarkable performance.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO2 is still unsatisfactory owing to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 is reduced to methanol with 100&#8201;% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) is 300&#8201;% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT could be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75&#8201;% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8211;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8211;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent behavior elucidation of disilane&#8208;bridged D&#8210;A&#8210;D triad composed of phenothiazine and thienopyrazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A s&#8210;p extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8210;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3 kcal/mol. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8210;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8210;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wittig reaction within a dearomatized pyridine ring system results in 4&#8208;alkylated pyridines, a valuable motif in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sciences. N&#8208;Triazinyl salts are key to this strategy, and a range of substituted pyridines and aldehydes are amenable. Late&#8208;stage methylation is also feasible using a formaldehyde surrogate.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine N&#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and N&#8208;triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.

         <title>An Efficient Diazirine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetra&#8208;diazirine based cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) is developed for the universal patterning of p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar conjugated polymers by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. The interchain packing orders, the thin film morphologies and the charge carrier mobilities of four conjugated polymers retain well after patterning.







Abstract
A diazirine&#8208;based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) with a tetrahedron geometry is presented for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. After blending of 4CNN with no more than 3&#8201;% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was achieved; regular patterns with size as small as 5&#8197;&#956;m were prepared with appropriate photomasks after 365&#8197;nm irradiation for just 40&#8197;s. The interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking and the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. A complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. The results show that 4CNN is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors for all&#8208;solution&#8208;processible flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Spin Interactions in One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of a Cumulene&#8208;Based Singlet Biradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet biradical based on [5]cumulene end&#8208;capped with phenalenyl moieties was synthesized. The strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking tendency of phenalenyl units led to controlled self&#8208;assembly, with the formation of one&#8208;dimensional chain assemblies. Variable&#8208;temperature structural and Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrated that intramolecular spin pairs forming cumulene bonds coupled intermolecularly to form a continuum spin system at low temperatures (see picture).







Abstract
The synthesis of phenalenyl&#8208;endcapped [5]cumulene as a cumulene&#8208;based singlet biradical and the spin correlation changes of one&#8208;dimensional aggregates are described. The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures, and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and intermolecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Stabilized Organic Cocrystals for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic co&#8208;crystals are solid&#8208;state multifunctional materials with intriguing properties whereas the supramolecular interactions within co&#8208;crystals limited their stability in solution and their application in biology. Utilizing metal&#8211;organic framework to stabilize and strengthen the charge&#8208;transfer interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor, a water&#8208;dispersible co&#8208;crystal was obtained and applied in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and intriguing properties, but supramolecular interactions restrict their stability in aqueous solution, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we report on the first biological application of aqueous dispersible self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca2+ as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8211;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47&#8197;&#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be attained and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8&#8201;%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials; it is also much higher than that of the FDA approved photothermal agent ICG as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy.

         <title>Thionitrite and Perthionitrite in NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity through formation of HSNO and HSSNO. Zinc complexes of their conjugate bases Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) result in stabilization of these anions at a biologically relevant metal site yet reveal disparate signaling output upon reaction with thiols.







Abstract
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases &#8722;SNO and &#8722;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8722;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While HSNO and HSSNO are elusive, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt3 to give Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating. Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols 4&#8722;XArSH in the reaction with Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing S&#8208;nitrosation to form Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.

         <title>Laterally Engineering Lanthanide&#8208;MOFs Epitaxial Heterostructures for Spatially Resolved Planar 2D Photonic Barcoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimension&#8208;tunable lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures were realized through spatial semi&#8208;confinement induced steric hindrance. They exhibit domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors and identifiable dimensional&#8208;tunable lengths, offering unique opportunities to design integrated microstructures and smart devices toward advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) heterostructures with domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors have shown great potential for achieving high&#8208;throughput sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeit and information security. Here, a strategy based on steric&#8208;hindrance effect is proposed to construct lateral lanthanide&#8208;MOFs (Ln&#8208;MOFs) epitaxial heterostructures, where the channel&#8208;directed guest molecules are introduced to rebalance in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth rates of the Ln&#8208;MOFs microrods and eventually generate lateral MOF epitaxial heterostructures with controllable aspect ratios. A library of lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity.

&lt;p&gt;Dimension-tunable lateral Ln-MOFs heterostructures were realized through spatial semi-confinement induced steric hindrance. They exhibit domain-controlled emissive colors and identifiable dimensional-tunable lengths, offering unique opportunities to design integrated microstructures and smart devices toward advanced anti-counterfeiting applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) heterostructures with domain-controlled emissive colors have shown great potential for achieving high-throughput sensing, anti-counterfeit and information security. Here, a strategy based on steric-hindrance effect is proposed to construct lateral lanthanide-MOFs (Ln-MOFs) epitaxial heterostructures, where the channel-directed guest molecules are introduced to rebalance in-plane and out-of-plane growth rates of the Ln-MOFs microrods and eventually generate lateral MOF epitaxial heterostructures with controllable aspect ratios. A library of lateral Ln-MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two-dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity. The results provide molecular-level insight into the use of modulators in governing crystallite morphology for spatially assembling multifunctional heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Diverse Conventional Photoredox Catalysts Induces Potent Photoreductant Activity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical activation of conventional photocatalysts induces potent photoreductant activity. These studies resulted in the discovery of an electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of cleaving strong aryl C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds to aryl radical intermediates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that enhanced activity relative to previously developed electron&#8208;primed photoredox systems was a result of improved catalyst stability.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that electrochemical stimulation induces new photocatalytic activity from a range of structurally diverse conventional photocatalysts. These studies uncover a new electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of promoting the reductive cleavage of strong C(sp2)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;O bonds. We illustrate several examples of the synthetic utility of these deeply reducing but otherwise safe and mild catalytic conditions. Finally, we employ electrochemical current measurements to perform a reaction progress kinetic analysis. This technique reveals that the improved activity of this new system is a consequence of an enhanced catalyst stability profile.

         <title>Coupling electrocatalytic NO oxidation over carbon cloth with hydrogen evolution reaction for nitrate synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and value&#8208;added chemicals sacrifice. In this work, the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as the promising anode substitution reaction to couple with hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39 V and 1.07 V were applied to reach the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, superior than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Modulation  Caused by&#160;Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M = Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M = Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics.  As a result  , the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and  recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts.  Furthermore, theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.</dc:description>

         <title>EDTA Lewis basic molecule as a highly active electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active catalysts in hydrogenation reduction of CO  2  are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in a heterogeneous catalyst always result in a low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based selectivity optimization. Herein, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) moleculars were firstly immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO  2  to CH  4  with an excellent performance, exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6% toward CH  4  and a partial current density of &#8208;16.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a potential of &#8208;1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO  &#8208;  groups in EDTA molecules are the active sites for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52 eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8208;1.57 eV), resulting in a high selectivity of CH  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;bound dense micelle brush supports for continuous flow catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to the poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. Here we report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (  C  &#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore act as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of  C  &#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep far beyond the resonance distance. This  C  &#8208;FRET mode provides a de novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Nanoparticles for the Deuteration and Tritiation of Benzylic Positions on Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. A practical way to obtain small palladium nanoparticles and to apply them as a catalyst for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is presented. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp. Benzylic positions situated far away from heteroatoms were labeled with high isotopic enrichments. The observed non&#8208;directed HIE gave rise to regioselectivities complementary to those obtained with other methods, which typically require specific directing groups. For this reason, the successful deuteration of a broad variety of benzylic positions created a helpful tool to produce internal LC&#8208;MS standards of complex drugs. Furthermore, this nanocatalyst paved the way for the radiolabeling of drug molecules with high specific activities by using low pressures of tritium gas.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer&#8217;s cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer&#8217;s depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock  &#945;  &#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5 kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and full chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.</dc:description>

Chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity in the distorted  cis  &#8208;substituted structures were controlled by the alkylidenecyclopropane reactivity and using the ketone functionality as a remote directing group for the Ir catalyst, respectively. The total synthesis suggested the absolute configuration of shagenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and of critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn  2+  probes with K  d  values ranging from 190 nM to 74 &#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn  2+  /insulin co&#8208;released during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording from isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt; 100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca  2+  influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets.&#160;The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn&#160;  2+  and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)  2  ] and [Cu(L2)  2  ] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)  2  ]  +  and [Cu(L2)  2  ]  +  with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)  2  ]  +  is best described as a Cu  I  complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)  2  ]  +  is a Cu  I  complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)  2  ]  2+  , best described as a Cu  I  complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile metal&#8208;ligand electron transfer makes these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Reference Electrodes for Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well&#8208;defined standard for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non&#8208;aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non&#8208;aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous home&#8208;made reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl&#8208;electrode. For the non&#8208;aqueous reference electrodes, we chose the ferrocene redox couple as an internal standard. From these measurements, we deduced that this new class of micro&#8208;reference electrodes is leak&#8208;tight and shows a stable electrode potential.</dc:description>

         <title>A new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte through multispectral characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix and solvent, is beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions among different components of QPE are still unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. Partial solvent molecules create the spatial isolation in QPE between polymer matrix and Li salts, while other part of solvent work for dissolving Li salts to form a local high concentration of Li  +  . As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li  +  are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and would promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Lactonization by &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Allylic Substitution: A Complement to &#960;&#8208;Allylmetal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful method for the formation of highly useful, non&#8208;racemic allylic compounds. Here we present a complementary enantioselective process that generates allylic lactones via &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. More specifically, a catalytic enantioselective dehydrative lactonization of allylic alcohols using a novel Pd(II)&#8208;catalyst containing the imidazole&#8208;based  P,N  &#8208;ligand (  S  )&#8208;StackPhos is reported. The high&#8208;yielding reactions are operationally simple to perform with enantioselectivities up to 99% ee. This strategy facilitates the replacement of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product avoiding complications arising from racemization by equilibration.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition of the True and False Resonance Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong influence of electronic circular dichroism on the measurement of resonance Raman optical activity of colorful chiral compounds is reported for a series of vitamin B12 derivatives. Neglecting this effect can lead to misinterpretation of recorded spectra, and seriously erroneous conclusions about molecular structure and chirality.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B12 derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.

         <title>Understanding and Calibration of Charge Storage Mechanism in Cyclic Voltammetry Curves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance, and diffusive capacity are achieved from the CV curves of typical electrode materials for metal&#8208;ion batteries after three successive treatments including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background as well as non&#8208;linear fitting calculation, offering a more rational and reliable method to calculate the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution.







Abstract
Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintained for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on cubic CoSe2 was doped with the light element nitrogen, the electronic structure was modulated while the highly symmetric crystal structure phase was maintained. This nitrogen&#8208;doped CoSe2 shows enhanced alkaline HER electrocatalytic activity, while no structural reconstruction occurs during the HER process.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms is one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatoms, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during the catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between the intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that nitrogen incorporation can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution activity (HER). In contrast, the introduction of phosphorus can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus&#8208;doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER.

     alt="Nitrogen-Doped Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintained for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on cubic CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was doped with the light element nitrogen, the electronic structure was modulated while the highly symmetric crystal structure phase was maintained. This nitrogen-doped CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows enhanced alkaline HER electrocatalytic activity, while no structural reconstruction occurs during the HER process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of heteroatoms is one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS-TMC), the introduction of heteroatoms, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during the catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between the intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase as an example, we demonstrate that nitrogen incorporation can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS-TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution activity (HER). In contrast, the introduction of phosphorus can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus-doped CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unstable for HER.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>18.77% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150  o  C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77% was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02%).</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs which exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Microporous Carbon Nitride (C3N5.4) with Tetrazine based Molecular Structure for Efficient Adsorption of CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new class of microporous carbon nitride with rich nitrogen moieties templated from zeolite shows periodic porosity with a unique CN framework and enhanced active sites that triggered high selective sensing owing to the high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen species.







Abstract
Mesoporous carbon nitrides with C3N5 and C3N6 stoichiometries created a new momentum in the field of organic metal&#8208;free semiconductors owing to their unique band structures and high basicity. Here, we report on the preparation of a novel graphitic microporous carbon nitride with a tetrazine based chemical structure and the composition of C3N5.4 using ultra&#8208;stable Y zeolite as the template and aminoguanidine hydrochloride, a high nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule, as the CN precursor. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the prepared material exhibits a new molecular structure, which comprises two tetrazines and one triazine rings in the unit cell and is thermodynamically stable. The resultant carbon nitride shows an outstanding surface area of 130.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption per unit surface area of 47.54&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is due to the existence of abundant free NH2 groups, basic sites and microporosity. The material also exhibits highly selective sensing over water molecules (151.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and aliphatic hydrocarbons due to its unique microporous structure with a high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen moieties and recognizing ability towards small molecules.

         <dc:description>Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using smFRET and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently&#8208;labeled encapsulins on a single molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst  via  covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform  in vitro  catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (~96 h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK degradation biology in vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nonheme Mononuclear {FeNO}7 Complex that Produces N2O in the Absence of an Exogenous Reductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first example of a nonheme, mononuclear {FeNO}7 complex that mediates the conversion of NO to N2O in the absence of an external reductant. A new mononuclear, 5&#8208;coordinate FeII complex is synthesized, which binds nitric oxide to form the {FeNO}7 complex. This complex exhibits a highly activated NO ligand as seen by RR spectroscopy, and generates N2O in THF upon addition of H2O.







Abstract
A new nonheme iron(II) complex, FeII(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (1), is reported. Reaction of 1 with NO(g) gives a stable mononitrosyl complex Fe(NO)(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (2), which was characterized by M&#246;ssbauer (&#948;=0.52&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1, |&#916;EQ|=0.80&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1), EPR (S=3/2), resonance Raman (RR) and Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The data show that 2 is an {FeNO}7 complex with an S=3/2 spin ground state. The RR spectrum (&#955;exc=458&#8197;nm) of 2 combined with isotopic labeling (15N, 18O) reveals &#957;(N&#8208;O)=1680&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is highly activated, and is a nearly identical match to that seen for the reactive mononitrosyl intermediate in the nonheme iron enzyme FDPnor (&#957;(NO)=1681&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Complex 2 reacts rapidly with H2O in THF to produce the N&#8208;N coupled product N2O, providing the first example of a mononuclear nonheme iron complex that is capable of converting NO to N2O in the absence of an exogenous reductant.

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo2C/C hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres with mesoporous thick inner shell and microporous thin outer shell are proposed as an ideal sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The double&#8208;shelled spheres demonstrate superior structual and compositional advantages when employed as cathode material in Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
One of the major challenges regarding the sulfur cathode of Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and the suppression of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling. This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS&#8208;HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS&#8208;HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability in the composed Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Applying Machine Learning to Rechargeable Batteries: From the Microscale to the Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on applying machine learning methods to lithium batteries&#8212;from the microscale to the macroscale&#8212;in combination with multiscale simulations, characterization techniques, and electrochemical tests. Machine learning enables the development of advanced theoretical and experimental tools, the mining of valuable information from datasets, and acceleration of strategy optimization for the design and management of battery materials.







Abstract
Emerging machine learning (ML) methods are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and have led to a focus on data&#8208;driven research. This Minireview summarizes the application of ML to rechargeable batteries, from the microscale to the macroscale. Specifically, ML offers a strategy to explore new functionals for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging descriptions of interfaces and amorphous structures. ML also possesses a great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thus be established, which can be used to predict the ionic conductivity of solids as well as the battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge procedures. The future combination of multiscale simulations, experiments, and ML is also discussed and the role of humans in data&#8208;driven research is highlighted.

         <title>Investigations of the Alignment Process of PBPMLG: 2H NMR Analysis reveals a thermoresponsive 90&#176; Flip of the Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated isotopologues of a thermoresponsive, glutamate&#8208;based alignment medium have been synthesized and investigated by 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry and polarized optical microscopy. The measurements show a flip of the polymeric &#945;&#8208;helix in lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, providing further insights into the alignment process of the polymer inside the magnetic field.







Abstract
The application of anisotropic parameters in NMR&#8208;spectroscopy enables the acquisition of spatial and angular information, complementary to those from conventional isotropic NMR&#8208;measurements. The use of alignment media is a well&#8208;established method for inducing anisotropy. PBPMLG is a recently discovered polyglutamate&#8208;based alignment medium, exhibiting thermoresponsive behavior in the lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) phase, thus offering potential for deeper understanding of the alignment process. We present one approach for investigating the thermoresponsive behavior by synthesizing specifically deuterated PBPMLG&#8208;isotopologues and their subsequent analyses using 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy. It was possible to relate the observed thermoresponsive behavior to a flip of the polymer with respect to the external magnetic field&#8212;an effect never observed before in glutamate&#8208;based polymeric alignment media. Furthermore, a solvent&#8208;induced temperature dependent gelation was verified in THF, which might provide yet another opportunity to manipulate the properties of this alignment medium in the future.

         <title>After 200 Years: The Structure of Bleach and Characterization of Hypohalite Ions by Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fill a gap in fundamental and applied chemistry by providing the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structure characterization of hypohalite ions, including sodium hypochlorite: the active component of liquid bleach, in use as a bleaching agent and sanitizer for at least two centuries.







Abstract
We report the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structures of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) and hypobromite (BrO&#8722;) salts, including hydrated sodium hypochlorite, a staple of the chlorine industry and ubiquitous bleaching and disinfection agent for almost 200&#8197;years. The structures, supported by variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy on individual crystals and periodic density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide insight into solid&#8208;state geometry and supramolecular chemistry of hypohalite ions.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85 &lt; RXB &lt; 0.99; Rxb = normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Dirhodium Artificial Metalloenzymes for Diazo Coupling Cascade Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution was used to improve dirhodium metalloenzyme (ArM)&#8208;catalyzed diazo cross&#8208;coupling yield and selectivity. The ArM was then used in cascade reactions where the alkene product was reduced by an ene reductase, with the ArM scaffold controlling chemoselectivity in the reaction mixture. MD simulations show that the cofactor modulates the domain dynamics and favors a more closed, hydrophobic pocket conducive to selective catalysis.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are commonly used to control the stereoselectivity of catalytic reactions, but controlling chemoselectivity remains challenging. In this study, we engineer a dirhodium ArM to catalyze diazo cross&#8208;coupling to form an alkene that, in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction, is reduced to an alkane with high enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by an alkene reductase. The numerous protein and small molecule components required for the cascade reaction had minimal effect on ArM catalysis. Directed evolution of the ArM led to improved yields and E/Z selectivities for a variety of substrates, which translated to cascade reaction yields. MD simulations of ArM variants were used to understand the structural role of the cofactor on ArM conformational dynamics. These results highlight the ability of ArMs to control both catalyst stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity to enable reactions in complex media that would otherwise lead to undesired side reactions.

         <title>Reclaiming Inactive Lithium with a Triiodide/Iodide Redox Couple for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries suffer from a short lifespan owing to apparently ceaseless inactive Li accumulation, which is accompanied by the consumption of electrolyte and active Li reservoir, seriously deteriorating the cyclability of batteries. Herein, a triiodide/iodide (I  3  &#8211;  /I  &#8211;  ) redox couple initiated by stannic iodide (SnI  4  ) is demonstrated to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I  3  &#8211;  converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, which then diffuses to the cathode side. The oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode transforms cathode into the lithiation state and regenerates I  3  &#8211;  , reclaiming Li ion from inactive Li. The regenerated I  3  &#8211;  engages the further redox reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Sn mitigates the corrosion of I  3  &#8211;  on active Li reservoir sacrificially. In working Li | LiNi  0.5  Co  0.2  Mn  0.3  O  2  batteries, the accumulated inactive Li is significantly reclaimed by the reversible I  3  &#8211;  /I  &#8211;  redox couple, improving the lifespan of batteries by twice. This work initiates a creative solution to reclaim inactive Li for prolonging the lifespan of practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arylated Amines via C&#8722;N Coupling of Chiral Amines with Aryl Bromides Promoted by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoretentive C&#8722;N coupling of optically active amines and amino acid esters with aryl bromides is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation, without the use of any external photosensitizers.







Abstract
The Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction has found widespread applications in organic synthesis. Over the past two decades or so, many improved catalysts have been introduced, allowing various amines and aryl electrophiles to be readily used nowadays. However, there lacks a protocol that could be used to couple a wide range of chiral amines and aryl halides, without erosion of the enantiomeric excess (ee). Reported in this article is a method based on molecular Ni catalysis driven by light, which enables stereoretentive C&#8208;N coupling of optically active amines, amino alcohols, and amino acid esters with aryl bromides, with no need for any external photosensitizer. The method is effective for a wide variety of coupling partners, including those bearing functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles, thus providing a viable alternative to accessing synthetically important chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids esters. Its viability is demonstrated by 92 examples with up to 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling studied the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolytes with a wide range of lattice mismatch, and discovered an interfacial disordered Li defect layer at the interfaces and their roles in leading to the interfacial failure during lithium cycling.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Herein, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovered the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Need for speed: An efficient and fast photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow has been realized by combining decatungstate photocatalysis and nickel catalysis. The methodology shows great functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various biologically&#8208;relevant molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.

The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon-centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iron(II) metal&#8211;organic framework containing accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers facilitates the direct reduction of NO to N2O.







Abstract
A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+ chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).

         <title>P&#8208;Block Atomically Dispersed Antimony Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony with Sb&#8722;N4 configuration has been developed and used as highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is credited to the p orbital interaction between Sb cation and O2, which facilitate the charge transfer and generate appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group (s&#8208; and p&#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized s/p&#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a p&#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8722;N4 configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V and excellent stability, which outperforms most transition&#8208;metal (TM, d&#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high specific capacity (803.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) in Zn&#8211;air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb&#8722;N4 single&#8208;metal sites, which have closed d shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the p orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O2&#8208;p orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic&#8208;level preparing p&#8208;block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main&#8208;group&#8208;metal SACs.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C, a highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid is reported. The synthetic strategy features efficient double ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions for the formation of the highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic system.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C is a complex hexacyclic C20 cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid featuring a highly strained 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic core containing eight consecutive stereocenters and two bridging lactones. The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C has been accomplished by lipase&#8208;mediated resolution, Ru&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) reactions, NiII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective Michael addition, and MnIII&#8208;catalyzed allylic oxidation as the key transformations.

         <title>{BiW8O30} Exerts Antitumor Effect by Triggering Pyroptosis and Upregulating Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. {BiW8} suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MG63 cells. We identified POM&#8208;induced pyroptosis for the first time. Decreased GSH content and increased ROS levels were observed in {BiW8}&#8208;treated cells. {BiW8} executed multiple antitumor mechanisms, such as activation of pyroptosis, regulation of oxidative stress, and inhibition of DNA repair.







Abstract
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0&#8197;h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59, 65, 75, 94, and 97&#8201;% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing the biomimetic macrocyclic hosts, amide naphthotubes, are able to effectively and rapidly adsorb polar organic micropollutants from water by employing host&#8211;guest binding. The polymers can be readily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH at room temperature.







Abstract
It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8211;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.

&lt;p&gt;The cross-linked polymers containing the biomimetic macrocyclic hosts, amide naphthotubes, are able to effectively and rapidly adsorb polar organic micropollutants from water by employing host&#8211;guest binding. The polymers can be readily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption-mediated processes. Macrocycle-crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8211;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts.

         <title>[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A Strategy for the Coordination of Cationic Moieties to Design Nonlinear Optical Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties offers a new possibility for the rational design and property modification of functional ionic materials, particularly NLO materials. As demonstrated by [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 and Ag2SO4, the exceptional enhancements of the linear birefringence and nonlinear SHG properties are attributed to the unique [Ag(NH3)2]+ cation moiety.







Abstract
Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein, we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well&#8208;known crystal structure, [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4, we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag+ cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal P
21c structure as a positive uniaxial crystal. The bending of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ cationic moiety parallel to the z&#8208;axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12&#8197;D along the z&#8208;direction, yet zero dipole in the xy&#8208;plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3&#8197;nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#916;nobv.=0.08, and [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 also exhibits a phase&#8208;matching NLO response 1.4 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) (obv. 1.4&#215;KDP @1064&#8197;nm; cal. d36=1.50&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1).

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of the Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric constants of solutions at different temperatures and compositions are comprehensively probed by considering the significant role in regulating solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation structures of working liquid electrolytes.







Abstract
The dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding of solution chemistry.

         <title>A Color&#8208;Shifting Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Aptamer&#8211;Fluorophore Module for Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;shifting, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent aptamer&#8211;fluorophore module based on benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin (BC) fluorophores for ratiometric RNA imaging is reported. Free BC is cyan fluorescent, however its fluorescence emission shifts to NIR upon complexation with the BC&#8208;binding aptamer (BeCA). This system enabled the visualization of mRNAs in the NIR region and the ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000) show high activity and selectivity for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes to synthesize organic nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource. Other oxidizable groups were tolerated, and no further reaction of the product was observed over Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000.







Abstract
Oxidative cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;x, x represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 was very selective and efficient for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles via oxidative cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Hydrogen Bonding of B3N6&#8208;[4]Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is isoelectronic to the trianion of [4]triangulene, represents a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride. The tert&#8208;butylated derivative of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene is synthesized by threefold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation. Its fluorescence in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through H&#8208;bonds, and it forms DD&#8208;AA H&#8208;bond arrays with di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrenetetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.







Abstract
Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8722;B&#8722;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC4N). A tert&#8208;butylated B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation of Racemic Diastereomers: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Michael&#8211;Henry Reactions to Afford Spirooxindoles Bearing Furan&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions that occur through dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of racemic diastereomers having central and axial chiralities have been developed for the synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused ring systems. The products, with four new chiral carbon centers, were obtained as single diastereomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) reactions of racemic diastereomer mixtures that afford the products as essentially single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities are described. We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.

         <title>The structure of cyclodecatriene collinolactone, its biosynthesis and semisynthetic analogues: Effects of&#160;monoastral phenotype&#160;and protection from intracellular oxidative stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently described rhizolutin and collinolactone share the same novel carbon scaffold. Analyses by NMR and X&#8208;Ray crystallography prove the structure of collinolactone isolated from  Streptomyces  G&#246; 40/10 and propose a revision of rhizolutin&#8217;s stereochemistry. Isotope&#8208;labelled precursor feeding indicate that collinolactone is biosynthesized via type&#8208;I polyketide synthase with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. CRISPR based genetic strategies led to the biosynthetic gene cluster and a high&#8208;production strain. Chemical semisyntheses yielded collinolactone analogues with inhibitory effects on L929 cell line. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that analogues monopolar spindles impairing cell division in mitosis. Inspired by the Alzheimer&#8208;protective activity of rhizolutin, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of collinolactone analogues on glutamate&#8208;sensitive cells (HT22) and indeed, natural collinolactone points to distinct neuroprotection from intracellular oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules endowed by their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling that would impact their essential molecular topology. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation is challenging and was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and by the use of chiral auxiliaries. Here, we now report that direct catalyst control is achieved by means of a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol in the preparation of various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh2(S&#8208;PTAD)4  as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four  anti  &#8208;folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Moreover, complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions, providing access to all four stereoisomers with an e.r. of up to 99:1. We envision that the catalyst controlled synthesis of overcrowded alkenes and the possibility for stereodivergence in the Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination will provide a direct and effective route for a broad range of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional molecules, catalysis, energy&#8208; and electron transfer, or bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright luminescence in three phases &#8211; A combined synthetic, spectroscopic and theoretical approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining phase&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements and quantum chemical calculations is a powerful approach to help understand the influence of the molecular surroundings on the PL properties. In this work, a phosphine functionalized amidinate was used to synthesize a bimetallic gold complex, featuring an unusual charge separation. The latter was subsequently used as metalloligand to yield heterotetrametallic complexes with an Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au &#8216;molecular wire&#8217; arrangement (M = Cu, Ag, Au) featuring metallophilic interactions. All compounds show bright phosphorescence in the solid state, also at ambient temperature. The effect of the molecular environment on the PL was studied in detail for these tetrametallic complexes by comparative measurements in solution, solid state as well as gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of a borylnitrene with carbon dioxide is studied under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions. Photogenerated CatBN (Cat = catecholato) reacts with CO  2  under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO  2  , a 3&#8208;oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&gt; 550 nm).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Nitrene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Oxaziridination/1,2&#8208;Alkyl Rearrangement of 1,3&#8208;Diketones toward Bicyclic Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutrophil Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate&#160;  in situ  &#160;study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation event as well as clinical diagnosis. However, the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probe is absent for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;is elucidated as Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally,&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic and Radical Heptafluoroisopropoxylation with Redox&#8208;Active Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF  3  )  2  ) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, the heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF  3  )  2  ) biologically interesting compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF  3  )  2  . The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents. Accordingly, two types of  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents including  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  phthalimide  A  and  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  benzotriazolium salt  O&#8217;  were used as OCF(CF  3  )  2  anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, such as alkyl halides, alcohols, alkenes, and (hetero)arenes, delivering the corresponding heptafluoroisopropoxylated products in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage heptafluoroisopropoxylation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals was also demonstrated. The X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis revealed that the dihedral angle of C  Ar  &#8722;O&#8722;CF(CF  3  )  2  and aromatic planes was around 80&#176; in aryl heptafluoroisopropyl ethers (ArOCF(CF  3  )  2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>A Zwitterionic Heterobimetallic Au&#8211;Fe Complex Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine)Silyliumylidene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of the first bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic imine&#8208;stabilized chlorosilyliumylidene 1 is reported. Remarkably, consecutive reaction of 1 with PPh3AuCl and K2Fe(CO)4 gives rise to the unique heterobimetallic complex 1,2&#8208;(MesNHI)2&#8208;C2H4&#8208;ClSiAuFe(CO)4 (4). The overall neutral complex 4 bears an unusual linear Si&#8211;Au&#8211;Fe structure and a rare anagostic interaction between the d10&#8208;configured gold atom and a CH bond of the mesityl ligand. According to the computational analysis and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, the formal Fe&#8208;oxidation state remains at &#8211;II. Thus, the electronic structure of 4 is best described as an overall neutral &#8211; yet zwitterionic &#8211; heterobimetallic &#8220;Si(II)+&#8211;Au(I)+&#8211;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8211;&#8220;&#8208;silylium&#173;ylidene complex, derived from double anion exchange. The computational analysis indicates strong hyperconjugative back donation from the gold(I) atom to the silyliumylidene ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Multicompositional Onion&#8208;like Nanoparticles via RAFT Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles of diameters in the range 100&#8211;150 nm comprising well&#8208;defined multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core has been conducted using surfactant&#8208;free aqueous macroRAFT emulsion polymerization. The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion&#8208;like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20 nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self&#8208;assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Interestingly, microphase separation can occur in these nanoparticle&#8208;based systems under conditions where the corresponding bulk system would not likely result in microphase separation as predicted by theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to its great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains much unknown that how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly  via  halogen bond, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (  F  4  DIB)  and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometre scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Media&#8208;Driven Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Cascades with 1,3&#8208;Diynamides Leading Selectively to Either Indoles or Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with various 1,3&#8208;diynamides yielding either 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles or 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines were established. Omitting or adding TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) to the reaction of  N  ,  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;iodophenyl)(4&#8208;toluenesulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynamides with secondary or pri&#173;mary amines in the presence of KOH in THF and catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh  3  )  4  completely changed the outcome of the reaction. In the absence of TBAF, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles were the sole products, while the presence of TBAF switched the product formation to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. Deuterium labeling proceeded selectively at the C3 and C11 positions of the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinoline products and this suggests the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides as reactive key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial linkage and carbon encapsulation enable full solution&#8208;printed perovskite photovoltaics with prolonged lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed an overwhelming success in their skyrocketed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) within a short period, but a fully solution&#8208;processed fabrication of PSC multilayer stack has not been achieved. Herein, we report to fabricate the simplified PSCs with perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) via a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage induced by perovskite precursor. The AS serves as a&#8220;molecular glue&#8221;to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, which remarkably facilitates the interfacial charge extraction, increases the PCEs by 77% and reduces the hysteresis.  A champion PCE of 18.64% has been achieved for the fully&#8208;printed devices, which is one of the highest reported values for the carbon&#8208;based PSCs.  AS&#8208;assisted interfacial linkage and carbon materials&#8208;assisted self&#8208;encapsulation remakably enhance the stability of the resultant PSCs, which did not experience any performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for more than 3000 hours. This work provides a novel strategy to tackle the incompatibility issue of depositing each functional layer by using a full solution process and offers an additional promise of constructing efficient perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics with prolonged lifespan in a low&#8208;cost manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofuel production can be a viable option for alleviating current heavy reliance on fossil resources and the related carbon dioxide emission issue. Hydrodeoxygenation refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, we show that well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (~ 1 nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. Furthermore, we have established and extended an understanding of the &#8216;intimacy criterion&#8217; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring fundamental new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, and may facilitate a new application potential for the practical production of pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Particle Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals the Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Co3O4 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co  3  O  4  nanocubes are evaluated concerning their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by means of single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co  3  O  4  nanocube. We were able to evaluate a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;nanoelectrode measurements performed with the same Co  3  O  4  nanocubes provide, on the one hand, an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5 A&#8729;cm  &#8208;2  , and on the other hand, allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8 x 10  4  s  &#8208;1  at 1.92 V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such current densities combined with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring structural changes during electrocatalysis, specifically the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer. Combining the information from two independent single&#8208;entity electrochemistry measurements provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8208;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well&#8208;define surface structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization by Hydromagnesiation: A Modular Strategy Towards N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reductive cyclization to prepare a variety of  N&#8208;heterocycles, through the use of  ortho&#8208;vinylanilides, is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron complex and generally occurs at ambient temperature. The transformation likely proceeds through hydromagnesiation of the vinyl group, and trapping of the  in situ  generated benzylic anion by an intramolecular electrophile to form the heterocycle. This iron&#8208;catalyzed strategy was shown to be broadly applicable and was utilized in the synthesis of substituted indoles, oxindoles and tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolone derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicated that the reversibility of the hydride transfer step depends on the reactivity of the tethered electrophile. The synthetic utility of our approach was further demonstrated by the formal synthesis of a reported bioactive compound and a family of natural products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#181;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#181;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#181;SR and &#181;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#181;  +  ), one ninth of the proton mass.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously  in vivo  because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Here we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for high selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplayed concentration change of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings showing that molten salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity of NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8208;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape engineer metal oxide crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emissions in Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials via Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiencies and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Here, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables the systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571 nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0%&#8211;29.2% and superb color purity could be produced by adopting this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy of Constructing Carbon Particles Modified Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide by metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts has been widely investigated in recent years, but the poor conductivity strongly limits the application of most MOFs catalysts. In order to overcome the above obstacles, we tried to use a gentle strategy to uniformly introduce highly dispersed carbon nanoparticles into the framework to improve the catalytic activity. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#183;2DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed, and there are two types of large 1D channels with a diameter of 1.6 and 1.2 nm in the framework. Experimental results show that V11 exhibits a moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0% of Faradaic efficiency for formate. To improve the catalytic activity of V11, methylene blue molecules were introduced into the framework as a carbon source due to its suitable size and carbonization temperature. After calcination at an appropriate temperature, carbon nanoparticles (CPs) with an average diameter of 3.85 nm were anchored in V11 and the framework can keep stable during the synthesis process. The obtained catalyst CPs@V11 was also applied in the CO2 electroreduction, and the maximum Faradaic efficiency of formate increases from 76.0% to 90.1% and the current density increased by 2.2 times. Control experiments and catalytic characterizations demonstrate that the introduced carbon nanoparticles can serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. Furthermore, this strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs to improve the catalytic performance in selectivity and current density, demonstrating the good universality of this facile method and giving inspiration to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A simple Gas&#8208;solid treatment for surface modification in Li&#8208;rich oxides cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O  2  loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8208;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O  2  release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4% and 85.5% at 1C and 2C to that (75.3% and 75.0%) of the pristine sample after 300 cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011V per cycle at 2C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
The in vivo structure of the redox&#8208;active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.







Abstract
The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122.) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y122. structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y122.. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122. are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y122. per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y. concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F3Y122., in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;Based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>

A cross&#8208;linkable spiropyran&#8208;based molecule (SPBM) containing mesogenic units with switchable color, photoluminescence and mesomorphism is synthesized. Therefore, programmable chromism and photoluminescence can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs, which own a tunable glass transition temperature (Tg) by converting the configuration of the crosslinked SPBMs to change the molecular order degree.







Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behavior of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via visible light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via UV light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given Tg of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable Tg can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.

         <title>Structural Basis for Isomerization Reactions in Fungal Tetrahydroxanthone Biosynthesis and Diversification</title>

The novel isomerase NsrQ from Aspergillus novofumigatus is a key enzyme for the structural diversification of the fungal tetrahydroxanthones. The crystal structures of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3 in complex with substrate analogues provided a structural basis for the dual isomerization reactions. These findings will lead to mechanistic understanding of the diversification and the stereochemical control in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis.







Abstract
The novel isomerase NsrQ, from Aspergillus novofumigatus, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and is responsible for dearomatizing cyclization to provide a tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two&#8208;step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at the methyl group. We report on the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ, and its homologue Dcr3, from Diaporthe longicolla. The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the nuclear transport factor 2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.

         <title>Few&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell MFI Zeolite Synthesized using a Simple Di&#8208;quaternary Ammonium Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>

A simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium cation was used as structure&#8208;directing agent to prepare few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (ca. 10&#8197;nm) MFI type zeolite catalysts and adsorbents with a wide range of composition (pure silica, aluminosilicate and stannosilicate). The SDA design was selected based on simple heuristic arguments regarding contributions of its structural elements to early crystal growth characteristics of MFI.







Abstract
Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.

Metabolite concentration can be measured ratiometrically with high sensitivity and specificity.

Abstract
We introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627&#8197;nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458&#8197;nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8208;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8208;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>

Symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes showed molecular&#8208;conformation&#8208;guided chiral hexagonal supramolecular packing and formed various helical nanoarchitectures, including unprecedented superhelices with molecular rigidity and assembly&#8208;boosted chiroptical performance.







Abstract
Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer&#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V&#8208;shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V-shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V-shaped molecules (&lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt;) displayed spacer-dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V-shaped &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self-assembly, the chiral V-shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; self-assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CD&lt;/sub&gt; for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V-shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19355-19363, August 23, 2021. </description>

Charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulators that can be specifically activated by acidic tumor microenvironment to release immunomodulator and enhance tumor penetration are developed for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomedicine can regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumors and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.

         <title>An Adjacent Atomic Platinum Site Enables Single&#8208;Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19262-19271, August 23, 2021. </description>

We have designed an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst of Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC with Fe&#8208;N4 and Pt&#8208;N4 dual atomic sites. The enhancement for the ORR activity is demonstrated by the modulation effect: Pt&#8208;N4 plays the role in modulating the Fe&#8208;N4 active center to optimize the ORR performance. The modulation effect is not effective for the enhancement of ORR performance in the systems of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC.







Abstract
The modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt&#8208;N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#916;E1/2=8&#8197;mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 systems.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>

2D and 3D N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are prepared and used as heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (RROP) of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The 2D COFs had higher catalytic activity and showed dimensionality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%).







Abstract
Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Herein we illustrate photocatalytic performances of N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded 2D&#8208;PN COFs and one 3D&#8208;PN COF were prepared. All can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers with a combination of linear (l) and cyclic (c) repeat units. The 2D&#8208;PN COFs have much higher catalytic activity than the 3D&#8208;PN COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%). The improved performance can be ascribed to the 2D structure which has a larger internal surface area, more catalytically active sites, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.

         <title>Beam Search for Automated Design and Scoring of Novel ROR Ligands with Machine Intelligence**
</title>

The beam search algorithm was employed for automated molecule design and scoring from a chemical language model (CLM). Prospective application of this model&#8208;intrinsic technique with a CLM trained on inverse ROR&#947; agonists yielded novel ligands of this nuclear receptor with the intended bioactivity. Beam search sampling overcomes the need for external scoring methods and extends the applicability of machine learning&#8208;driven molecular design.







Abstract
Chemical language models enable de&#8197;novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. Herein, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.

         <title>Enabling Cysteine&#8208;Free Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with a Ligation Auxiliary Capable of Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19483-19490, August 23, 2021. </description>

The MPyE group is the first sulfur based auxiliary enabling peptide ligation at proline and &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids. The pyridine nitrogen probably acts as a base that catalyzes the S&#8594;N acyl transfer during native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a MnII complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots</title>

Highly crystalline triazine&#8208;based carbon nitride quantum dots (c&#8208;CNQDs) with rich &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH terminal groups are synthesized in large scale. Under proper irradiation, c&#8208;CNQDs undergo a unique gradual self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization process, initiated by photocatalytic cross&#8208;linking effect between &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 edge groups of neighboring QDs. Addition of electron scavengers can effectively suppress the assembling behavior.







Abstract
The study of nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into superlattices or superstructures is of great significance in nanoscience. Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs), being a promising new group of nanomaterials, however, have hardly been explored in their self&#8208;organizing behavior. Here we report of a unique irradiation&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization phenomenon of crystalline CNQDs (c&#8208;CNQDs) terminated by abundant oxygen&#8208;containing groups. Unlike the conventional self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into ordered superstructures, the photoinduced self&#8208;assembly of c&#8208;CNQDs resembles a &#8220;click reaction&#8221; process of macromolecules, in which the activated &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 functional groups along the perimeters initiate cross&#8208;linking of adjacent QDs through a photocatalytic effect. Our findings unveil fundamental physiochemical features of CNQDs and open up new possibilities of manipulating carbon nitride nanomaterials via controlled assembly. Prospects for potential applications are discussed as well.

         <title>A Chemiluminescent Tetraaryl Diborane(4) Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19397-19405, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of boron doping with an antiaromaticity/aromaticity switch allowed the preparation of a unique diborane(4) tetraanion. Air oxidation leads to blue chemiluminescence, while controlled two&#8208;electron oxidation furnishes a dianionic diborene. The reactivities of the compounds are characterized by boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H activation, single electron transfers, and Stone&#8211;Wales&#8208;type rearrangements.







Abstract
Two subvalent, redox&#8208;active diborane(4) anions, [3]4&#8722; and [3]2&#8722;, carrying exceptionally high negative charge densities are reported: Reduction of 9&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene with Li granules without stirring leads to the crystallization of the B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp2) diborane(5) anion salt Li[5]. [5]&#8722; contains a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl&#8208;bridged B&#8722;B core, a chelating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl moiety, and a MeO substituent. Reduction of Li[5] with Na metal gives the Na+ salt of the tetraanion [3]4&#8722; in which two doubly reduced 9&#8208;borafluorenyl fragments are linked via a B&#8722;B single bond. Comproportionation of Li[5] and Na4[3] quantitatively furnishes the diborane(4) dianion salt Na2[3], the doubly boron&#8208;doped congener of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bis(fluorenylidene). Under acid catalysis, Na2[3] undergoes a formal Stone&#8211;Wales rearrangement to yield a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivative with B=B core. Na2[3] shows boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity toward n&#8208;butyl chloride. Na4[3] produces bright blue chemiluminescence when exposed to air.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>

We report an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonation towards pyrrole and indole polycyclic scaffolds featuring five&#8208;, six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings, with tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The process can be coupled with the desymmetrization of prochiral centers to obtain pyrrole&#8208; and indole&#8208;fused scaffolds with either vicinal or skipped stereocenters. DFT studies shed light on the mechanism and key stereodetermining factors.







Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation Improves the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19324-19330, August 23, 2021. </description>

A Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst improves the ethylene selectivity compared with a coated Pd monometallic catalyst. The intrinsic activity is preserved and is approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga2O3&#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H2 activation than that of Pd1Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ag single-atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long-term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high-coking resistance. H-D exchange measurements further show that the Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation than that of Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Materials Engineering of Violin Soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>

ICP&#8208;MS is used to identify the unique mineral recipe used by Antonio Stradivari to treat his spruce wood, the material for the violin top plate. Chemical manipulation led to hemicellulose fragmentation and cellulose rearrangement. Incorporating engineered wood may contribute to the unique tonal qualities of these acclaimed instruments.







Abstract
We investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri's practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19183-19190, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li3PO4 and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell, more than 300&#8197;cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Prototypical Li&#8208;O2 and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.

A series of halogen bonding (XB) tetraphenylethene (TPE) based anion receptors are reported. The receptors exhibit a remarkable anion&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on luminescence response, in which halogen bonding anion interactions drive the formation of emissive nanoscale aggregates. Disubstituted XB TPE derivatives function as photoswitchable anion receptors, in which modulation of photostationary states is intimately related to anion affinity.







Abstract
A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported. 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Complex N&#8208;Glycans of the Parasite S. mansoni to Examine the Importance of Epitope Presentation on DC&#8208;SIGN recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19287-19296, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular recognition of chemoenzymatically synthesized glycans derived from the parasitic worm S. mansoni by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN was investigated by a combination of NMR, computational and electron microscopy. It uncovered the importance of glycan complexity for lectin recognition including the influence of glycan valency, core xylosylation and length of oligo&#8208;LacNAc residues.







Abstract
The importance of multivalency for N&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions has primarily been studied by attachment of minimal epitopes to artificial multivalent scaffold and not in the context of multi&#8208;antennary glycans. N&#8208;glycans can be modified by bisecting GlcNAc, core xylosides and fucosides, and extended N&#8208;acetyl lactosamine moieties. The impact of such modifications on glycan recognition are also not well understood. We describe here a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide N&#8208;glycans expressed by the parasitic worm S. mansoni having unique epitopes at each antenna and containing core xyloside. NMR, computational and electron microscopy were employed to investigate recognition of the glycans by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN. It revealed that core xyloside does not influence terminal epitope recognition. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans bound with higher affinity to DC&#8208;SIGN compared to mono&#8208;valent counterparts, which was attributed to proximity&#8208;induced effective concentration. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans cross&#8208;linked DC&#8208;SIGN into a dense network, which likely is relevant for antigen uptake and intracellular routing.

         <title>Synergistic Lysozyme&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy Against Resistant Bacteria based on an Intelligent Upconversion Nanoplatform</title>

A nanohybrid UCMB&#8208;LYZ&#8208;HP was designed with features of intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive release of lysozyme and NIR&#8208;triggered high production of 1O2. By synergistically combining the enzymatic and photodynamic effect, the nanohybrid exhibited an extraordinary antibacterial capacity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue infections caused by resistant bacteria.







Abstract
The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Now we designed a bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus. These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.

tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks divergent reactivity embedded in nitrostilbenes to construct N&#8208;hydroxyindoles or oxindoles depending on whether sodium or potassium is the counterion.







Abstract
tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks new reactivity patterns embedded in nitroarenes. Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium tert&#8208;butoxide was found to produce N&#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or N&#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19232-19240, August 23, 2021. </description>

A small amount of TMSB molecules are found to effectively optimize SEI via EDL structure regulation. Their preferable adsorption on the Li&#8208;metal surface and their attraction to PF6&#8722; ions result in a high&#8208;local ion concentration in the EDL region, thus forming an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and demonstrating superior performance.







Abstract
Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19428-19434, August 23, 2021. </description>

A highly efficient site&#8208;selective desymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;dienes is reported. This protocol allows rapid access to a wide range of chiral allylic alcohols and amides bearing two vicinal chiral centers adjacent to the alkene. The utility of this method is further highlighted by the synthesis of the alkyl side chain of zaragozic acid&#8197;A and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;invictolide.







Abstract
The control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes via iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of meso dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxy oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products zaragozic acid&#8197;A and (+)&#8208;invictolide.

         <title>Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free&#8208;Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine&#8208;Based Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19389-19396, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual&#8208;mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and peroxide&#8208;free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain&#8208;growth modes.







Abstract
Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization&#8208;initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free&#8208;radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical&#8208;propagation process.

     alt="Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free-Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine-Based Organic Electron Donors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual-mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light-, metal-, and peroxide-free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain-growth modes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization-initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine-based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free-radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron-transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain-growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical-propagation process. The benefit of this dual-mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

We integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. This system is used to monitor the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. We observed the parallel activities of urease, catalase, and glucose oxidase by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled.

Versatile one&#8208;pot synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires breaks through the limitation of nanoelectrode materials to facilely construct high&#8208;performance single nanowire electrodes. Concurrently with excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and antifouling properties, the nanowire electrodes show great superiority in real&#8208;time monitoring of biological molecules and unraveling the relevant signaling pathway inside single living cells.







Abstract
A strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes is proposed. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8211;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8211;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells.

         <title>Tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine Backbone for Highly Efficient Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Completely Horizontal Molecular Orientation</title>

The expansion of TBPZ acceptor plane well&#8208;controlled the excited states involving 1CT, 3CT and 3LE states, which enhances the kRISC by remarkably shortening &#964;d and induced a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM. Consequently, PQ3 displayed an orange red EL max at 586&#8197;nm, PLQY of ca. 83&#8201;%, kRISC of 8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#964;d of 2.7&#8197;&#956;s, S values of &#8722;0.49, and deliver high EQE of 27.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.

Using different small molecules targeting protein kinases and BACE1 templated synthesis, we have obtained well&#8208;balanced multitarget compounds. They have three different biological activities and may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of complex diseases such as AD.







Abstract
Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19222-19231, August 23, 2021. </description>

A multicomponent polymerization for the efficient synthesis of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was developed. These hyperbranched polymers showed excellent solubility, high quantum yields, tunable emission, and strong ROS generation ability, allowing for their widespread applications in highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning, efficient bacterial killing, and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms.







Abstract
We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF6, and H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011&#215;106) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way.

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19383-19388, August 23, 2021. </description>

Tuning dispersity and molecular weight distribution shape significantly impacts polymer properties. Herein, we report a straight&#8208;forward approach, wherein blending just two polymers allows for unrivalled precision in tuning molecular weight distributions.







Abstract
The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &#272; and one of low &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19435-19441, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrid catalyst with abundant Zn defects exhibits an outstanding OER performance, demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. DFT calculations reveal that the built&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defects can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improving the intrinsic catalytic performance. This study provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterojunctions with defects.







Abstract
Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve activity of metal sulfide. However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

         <title>Record Productivity and Unprecedented Molecular Weight for Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19253-19261, August 23, 2021. </description>

Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides by organoboron catalysts is presented. In view of their facile preparation and unprecedented performance (thermostability, reactivity, and productivity), the catalysts provided here hold promise in pushing ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to the industry line.







Abstract
Producing polyesters with high molecular weight (Mn) through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides remains a major challenge. Herein, we communicate a metal&#8208;free, highly active, and high thermoresistance system for the ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to prepare polyesters (13 examples). The organoboron catalysts can endure a reaction temperature as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C for the ROCOP of cyclohexane oxide (CHO) with phthalic anhydride (PA) without the observation of any side reactions. The average Mn of the produced poly(CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;PA) climbed to 94.5&#8197;kDa with low polydispersity (&#208;=1.19). Furthermore, an unprecedented turnover number of 9900, equivalent to an efficiency of 7.4&#8197;kg of polyester/g of catalyst, was achieved at a feed ratio of CHO/PA/catalyst=20000:10000:1 at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic studies, crystal structure analysis, 11B&#8197;NMR spectra, and DFT calculations provided mechanistic justification for the effectiveness of the catalyst system.

         <title>Editing Light Emission with Stable Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks via Wall Surface Perturbation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19419-19427, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization enables the construction of highly emissive stable covalent organic frameworks linked by hydrazone bond. Perturbation of pore wall surface site can tune the emission to achieve three primary colors of light, rendering the materials able to edit various emission colors by organizing different surface sites onto the pore wall.







Abstract
The ordered &#960; skeletons of covalent organic frameworks make them viable light&#8208;emitting materials but their limited tunability has precluded further implementation. Here we report the synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;linked frameworks which are stable in water, acid, and base, and demonstrate their utility as a platform for light emission. The polygonal backbone is designed to be luminescent and partially &#960; conjugated while the pore wall is docked with single atom or unit to induce resonance, hyperconjugation, and tautomerization effects. These effects can be transmitted to the backbone, so that the framework can emit three primary colors of light. The wall can be perturbated with multiple surface sites, rendering the material able to edit diverse emission colors in a predesignable and digital way. The systems show high activity, stability, tunability, and sensibility: a set of features attractive for light&#8208;emitting and sensing applications.

         <title>Insight into the Alkaline Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ammonium Groups for Anion&#8208;Exchange Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19272-19280, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores the alkaline stability and degradation mechanism of 24 representative N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium groups and poly(aryl piperidinium)&#8208;based polyelectrolytes for anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), providing a clear guideline for design of highly stable anion&#8208;exchange membranes and ionomers. The structure&#8211;durability relationship between ammonium groups, anion&#8208;exchange polyelectrolytes, and AEMFCs was revealed.







Abstract
The alkaline stability of N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium (NHA) groups is a critical topic in anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs) and AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a systematic study on the alkaline stability of 24 representative NHA groups at different hydration numbers (&#955;) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The results elucidate that &#947;&#8208;substituted NHAs containing electron&#8208;donating groups display superior alkaline stability, while electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents are detrimental to durable NHAs. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations and experimental results suggest that nucleophilic substitution is the dominant degradation pathway in NHAs, while Hofmann elimination is the primary degradation pathway for NHA&#8208;based AEMs. Different degradation pathways determine the alkaline stability of NHAs or NHA&#8208;based AEMs. AEMFC durability (from 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) suggests that NHA&#8208;based AEMs are mainly subjected to Hofmann elimination under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density for 1000&#8197;h, providing insights into the relationship between current density, &#955; value, and durability of NHA&#8208;based AEMs.

The RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains 15 independently folded regulatory RNA elements. By NMR&#8208;based fragment screening, the RNA target space for small molecule binding, functional mapping and inhibition is defined.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30&#8201;000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex&#8208;vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbor ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Multicatalytic Transformation of (Meth)acrylic Acids: a One&#8208;Pot Approach to Biobased Poly(meth)acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19374-19382, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a multicatalytic approach for the one&#8208;pot production of (meth)acrylate monomers, allowing the formation of the corresponding (co)polymers from renewable feedstocks. This highly efficient strategy allowed us to perform multiple catalytic transformations in one pot, while bypassing several purification steps. This procedure can therefore minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practicalities.







Abstract
Shifting from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources can address some of the environmental issues associated with petrochemical extraction and make plastics production sustainable. Therefore, there is a growing interest in selective methods for transforming abundant renewable feedstocks into monomers suitable for polymer production. Reported herein are one&#8208;pot catalytic systems, that are active, productive, and selective under mild conditions for the synthesis of copolymers from renewable materials. Each system allows for anhydride formation, alcohol acylation and/or acid esterification, as well as polymerization of the formed (meth)acrylates, providing direct access to a new library of unique poly(meth)acrylates.

         <title>Current&#8208;Density Regulating Lithium Metal Directional Deposition for Long Cycle&#8208;Life Li Metal Batteries</title>

The structure of Li metal anode was designed, in which the CCA layer working as charge organizer was placed between the current collector and the anode. It makes the main Li depositional interface transfer to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface, which effectively protects the separate. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8220;orientated&#8208;growth&#8221; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer that induces a high current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both in situ and ex situ images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. The electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LFP full cell capable of maintaining 94&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Rationalizing the Unprecedented Stereochemistry of an Enzymatic Nitrile Synthesis through a Combined Computational and Experimental Approach</title>

Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.







Abstract
In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a smaller cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme, with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe was utilized.

&lt;p&gt;Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.

&lt;p&gt;In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase-catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E- and Z-aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E- and Z-aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19314-19323, August 23, 2021. </description>

Selenophene end&#8208;capped asymmetric heteroheptacene core is used to construct an efficient nonfullerene acceptor (MQ6) which shows increased carrier transport due to the enhanced O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se intramolecular noncovalent interaction as well as the increased dipole moment. MQ6 exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 16.39&#8201;% when blended with a wide band gap copolymer.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5, MQ6) are synthesized using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores with selenophene heterocycles. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se compared to that of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64&#8201;% compared to MQ3, which shows a PCE of 13.51&#8201;%. Based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows an improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. MQ6 exhibits a PCE of 16.39&#8201;% with a VOC of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a JSC of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was employed to synthesize dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A NF&#8208;SMAs. Their detailed single&#8208;crystal packing were revealed successfully.

Abstract
A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was used for the synthesis of symmetric or dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) with different numbers of selenophene. From S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl to A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and to S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl, a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed. A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl. The dissymmetric A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;based device has a PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary polymer solar cells. The combination of dissymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is effective to improve Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc.

         <title>Identifying Structure&#8211;Selectivity Correlations in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2: A Comparison of Well&#8208;Ordered Atomically Clean and Chemically Etched Copper Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces</title>

Subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces affect their CO2RR selectivity. Clean, flat, atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; but these actually favor production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. Structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.







Abstract
The identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to specific chemical products is elusive, owing in part to insufficient data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO2RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; however, these were found experimentally to favor the production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example by electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, are significant amounts of hydrocarbons generated. These results show that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19281-19286, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New telluronium salts exhibit enhanced properties due to the presence of 3 &#963;&#8208;holes. This is highlighted in solution by Ph3PO&#8208;binding studies through 17O, 31P, and 125Te NMR as well as mass spectrometry and NOESY NMR. The enhanced chalcogen&#8208;bonding properties translated into high catalytic performance, with low loadings (0.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (5&#8197;min&#8211;2&#8197;h), and high yields.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid, but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalysts. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic properties at low loadings in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8211;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder between Danishefsky's diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (17O, 31P, and 125Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;New telluronium salts exhibit enhanced properties due to the presence of 3 &#963;-holes. This is highlighted in solution by Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO-binding studies through &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P, and &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te NMR as well as mass spectrometry and NOESY NMR. The enhanced chalcogen-bonding properties translated into high catalytic performance, with low loadings (0.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (5&#8197;min&#8211;2&#8197;h), and high yields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen bonding results from non-covalent interactions occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid, but Te-based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalysts. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic properties at low loadings in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8211;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;-unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza-Diels&#8211;Alder between Danishefsky's diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi-nuclear (&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P, and &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inside Cover: Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 18894-18894, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important challenge in the direct utilization of Li metal as an anode material for next&#8208;generation batteries is the lack of stable solid electrolyte interphase layers. The problem is even more acute when non&#8208;flammable electrolytes, such as organic phosphates, are used. In their Research Article on page&#8197;19183, Dunwei Wang and co&#8208;workers report a new strategy that helps solve this issue. By introducing oxygen, the authors were able to induce unique chemical reactions that lead to safe operations of Li metal batteries that are flame&#8208;resistant.

         <dc:description>
The structure and regulation of the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase in whole E.&#8197;coli cells was investigated by using advanced EPR spectroscopy. This radical starts the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks, and is thus involved in essential processes in life. The observations reported by M&#252;ge Kasanmascheff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;19155 were surprising and exciting because the findings indicated a distinct radical distribution within the cells, pointing to a complex regulation mechanism of this fundamental enzyme in its native environment.

Mobilization upon cooling Adsorbed on a copper surface, dimolybdenum tetraacetate molecules form an ordered structure of upright&#8208;standing molecules at room temperature. Upon cooling down to 220&#8197;K, the molecules become mobile on the surface. This counterintuitive phase transition from an ordered structure at high temperatures to a mobile phase at low temperatures can be explained by a smaller molar entropy in the mobile phase as compared to the ordered phase, as reported by Angelika K&#252;hnle and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;19117.

         <title>Nanoscale Advancement Continues&#8212;From Catalysts and Reagents to Restructuring of Reaction Media</title>

In the highlighted article, the effect of alkane and water additives on the structure of several ionic liquids was used to increase the acidity of liquid reaction media and to accelerate the acid&#8208;catalyzed transformations. A possible connection between the appearance of a pronounced microstructure of the obtained systems and their performance in catalytic processes was proposed on the basis of microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies dedicated to the search for specific properties of matter at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales have greatly enriched the fields of chemistry and materials science. From the point of view of synthetic chemistry, discoveries in the field of nanoscale catalysis, in which the size effects of active centers are used to accelerate the reactions, are of particular importance. However, another approach for the promotion of chemical transformations based on the micro&#8208; or nanoconfinement of reacting molecules or even on the structuring of the reaction media as a whole is gaining interest as a highly valuable tool. Herein, we highlight the example of an increase in the efficiency of phenol alkylation and tert&#8208;butylation of benzyl alcohol in reaction media based on ionic liquids by the creation of acidic microdomains in the presence of small molecule additives.

This Minireview focuses on the developments of adsorbents for the separation and purification of hydrocarbons from, for example, methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, and propene/propane mixtures as well as for the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers).







Abstract
This Minireview focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and porous organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.

Photo&#8208;mediated fixation of carbon&#8208;based gas molecules: C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing carbon&#8208;based small gas molecules, including CO, CO2, acetylene, ethylene, ethane and methane, as feedstocks is attractive but challenging. The emergence of photoredox chemistry and the development of engineered flow technology have provided vast opportunities for gas conversions, which has gained tremendous momentum over the past decade.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based gas molecules are readily available feedstocks and are widely used in industry as building blocks or fuels. However, their application in the synthesis of fine chemicals has been hampered due to operational complexity, poor reaction efficiency and selectivity. Recent development of photoredox&#8208;promoted transformations using such gaseous reagents has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. In this review, efforts in developing light&#8208;promoted organic transformations using carbon&#8208;based natural gases as C1 or C2 feedstocks and to overcome the associated challenges are briefly summarized.

         <title>Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>

This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving Deoxyribozymes Differentiate Methylated Cytidine Isomers in RNA</title>

In vitro selected deoxyribozymes respond to the presence of methylcytidines m3C, m4C and m5C in RNA with either enhanced or strongly diminished cleavage rates, and thereby directly reveal the presence of the modified cytidines in target RNA.







Abstract
Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxyribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxyribozymes are programmable for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Sweat&#8208;Based Tracking of L&#8208;Dopa Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following an Oral Tablet Administration</title>

Non&#8208;invasive touch&#8208;based sweat measurements are used for tracking the pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration.







Abstract
Levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L&#8208;Dopa long&#8208;term use is associated with the development of motor and non&#8208;motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L&#8208;Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase&#8208;modified electrode, where sweat L&#8208;Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose&#8208;response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch&#8208;based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples.

         <title>The Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction Directing the Design of Single Atomic Site Catalysts: Achieving High Efficiency Towards Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19085-19091, August 23, 2021. </description>

The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) is closely related to the electronic structure of active sites, which determines the catalytic activity. We put forward a method of designing the EMSI of single&#8208;atomic site catalysts (SACs) to achieve high efficiency. The SACs achieve a lower overpotential and higher mass activity than any other SACs towards hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the benefits of this method.







Abstract
It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22&#8197;mV and 86&#8197;mV at the at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 (vs. 192.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (&#8776;20&#8201;% electricity consuming decrease at 2&#8197;kA&#8201;m&#8722;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.

         <title>Manipulations of Chiroptical Properties in Belt&#8208;Persistent Cycloarylenes via Desymmetrization with Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19097-19101, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of chiral cylindrical cycloarylenes ought to be beneficial to maximize the dissymmetry factor g via reduction of the electric dipole moment &#956;. An ideal D2 molecule has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization of two different arylene panels. Twists in biaryl linkages, however, enlarged an orthogonal component of &#956;, and the inclined and enlarged &#956; moment resulted in a much smaller g than expected.







Abstract
A desymmetrization strategy has been devised in the design of molecular cylinders to maximize the dissymmetry factor relevant to circularly polarized light. Although the highest dissymmetry factor of organic molecules was previously achieved with a chiral belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylene having magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in parallel, we noticed that an unbalanced magnitude of two moments was detrimental for higher dissymmetry factors. In this study, a molecular cylinder was desymmetrized by arraying doped and undoped panels via stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization. The desymmetrization succeeded in balancing two moments by reducing the electric transition moment at the global minimum but failed to maximize the dissymmetry factor. Structural studies revealed that the dissymmetry factor is sensitive to subtle structural fluctuations, while the rotatory strength is not affected. This study is important for the development of chiroptical materials.

         <title>Mobilization upon Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19117-19122, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We all know that ice becomes liquid upon heating. In contrast, melting upon cooling is an unusual behavior. A system of molecules adsorbed to a surface, which become mobile upon cooling, was developed. The key for understanding these counterintuitive phase transitions lies in the fact that the high temperature ordered phase possesses more degrees of freedom leading to a larger entropy than the low&#8208;temperature unordered phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions between different aggregate states are omnipresent in nature and technology. Conventionally, a crystalline phase melts upon heating as we use ice to cool a drink. Already in 1903, Gustav Tammann speculated about the opposite process, namely melting upon cooling. So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper(111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.

         <title>The Hydrates of TEMPO: Water Vibrations Reveal Radical Microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19013-19017, August 23, 2021. </description>

The mono&#8208; and dihydrates of the persistent TEMPO radical are vibrationally characterized at low temperature without environment, also by analogy to the closed shell ketone analogue from which it is formally obtained by replacing the C by an N atom.







Abstract
An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analogue, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>

         <dc:description>
Replacing one oxygen by one sulfur per monomer converts native oligonucleotides that cannot enter cells into cell&#8208;penetrating oligophosphorothioates. The reason for this is thiol&#8208;mediated uptake: dynamic covalent exchange with cellular thiols and disulfides that can be inhibited and activated according to the principles of dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom. They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA. Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials. However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown. Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake. The transient adaptive network produced by dynamic covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action. Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.

The amino&#8208;functionalized reconstructed indium&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst demonstrates a high activity for carbon dioxide electroconversion to formate in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.







Abstract
We report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.

We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.







Abstract
Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (.CH3 in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy Using Nickel Catalysis</title>

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed highly selective C1&#8722;C8 bond cleavage of BCBs with the insertion of alkynes was achieved by the assistance of a removable blocking group. This method provided an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical approach to structurally important 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediols under pH&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of Acid&#8208;Free Neutral Oxoborane</title>

A new type of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane has been prepared via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf in which the shortest B=O distance observed so far has been measured, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of an acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>

We report a chiral mesostructured BiOBr film exhibiting a chirality&#8208;dependent circularly polarized colour response due to the structural&#8208;handedness matching and synergistic effect of multiple optical activities.







Abstract
Achieving strong and broadband circularly polarized colour responses in chiral inorganic materials is challenging. Here, we fabricated chiral mesostructured bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) films (CMBFs) via hydrothermal growth using chiral sugar alcohols as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. The layered slabs of BiOBr crystals with weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangements of fine size. Three levels of chirality exist in the CMBFs: primary, helical distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary, helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and tertiary, chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range of 350&#8211;2500&#8197;nm with an anisotropic factor of up to 0.99, which led to a significant chirality&#8208;dependent colour response to circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the result of enhanced resonance due to structural&#8208;handedness matching and the synergistic effect of multiple OAs.

Ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles confined on the inner and outer surfaces of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (Pt&#8208;Co@NCNT) have been synthesized through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach. With the structural and compositional merits, the Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst presents superior activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media for the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with closed ends. During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption for hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.

Three kinds of lamellar COFs were exfoliated into discrete nanosheets with large aspect&#8208;ratios. The nanosheets were assembled into ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional membranes with staggered stacking patterns, respectively. Taking advantage of narrowed pore size and CO2&#8208;philic adsorption, these single&#8208;phase COF nanosheet membranes were characterized by superior CO2/H2 separation performances.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light&#8208;weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely&#8208;tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single&#8208;phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro&#8208;structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2&#8208;philic separation performances, among which TpPa&#8208;2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2/H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298&#8197;K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

         <title>Revision of the Unstable Picrotoxinin Hydrolysis Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19113-19116, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of picrotoxinin (PXN), which is a plant metabolite that is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling, in weakly alkaline media gives an unstable hydrolysis intermediate that was initially assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. This assignment however has been shown to be in error on the basis of the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrolysis product in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.







Abstract
The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19018-19023, August 23, 2021. </description>

A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes integrated with perylene diimide is developed. The macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and degenerated LUMO levels. The porous supramolecular structures display micropore characteristics and charge transporting properties.







Abstract
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral ortho&#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8211;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. A moderate electron mobility of 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.







Abstract
We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19139-19143, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hangtaimycin biosynthesis proceeds through a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery that contains distinctive dehydrating bimodules. Here we present detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules that are generally involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides with Z double bonds. This work lays the foundations for future structural modifications by protein engineering.







Abstract
A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.

SiNcTI&#8208;Br with strong self&#8208;doping property, high conductivity, and high electron mobility is an excellent cathode interlayer material. The interlayer boosts the power conversion efficiency of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs to 16.71&#8201;%. It is the first naphthalocyanine derivative used as interlayer material in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Naphthalocyanine derivatives (SiNcTI&#8208;N and SiNcTI&#8208;Br) were firstly used as excellent cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) in organic solar cells, via introducing four electron&#8208;withdrawing imide groups and two hydrophilic alkyls. Both of them showed deep LUMO energy levels (below &#8722;3.90&#8197;eV), good thermal stability (Td &gt;210&#8201;&#176;C), and strong self&#8208;doping property. The SiNcTI&#8208;Br CIM displayed high conductivity (4.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (7.81&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which could boost the efficiencies of the PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs over a wide range of CIM layer thicknesses (4&#8211;25&#8197;nm), with maximum efficiency of 16.71&#8201;%.

A direct &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.







Abstract
A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Supported Lipid Monolayers using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Label&#8208;free and non&#8208;destructive chemical and structural imaging of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111) is demonstrated with a spatial resolution of &#8776;20&#8197;nm using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for the first time. Ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and spatial resolution of TERS allows reproducible hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder within DPPC monolayers.







Abstract
Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8208;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.

We report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using the Langlois reagent. Arylcarbamates, including the bioactive compound chlorzoxazone, vorinostat precursor, chlorpropham, and teriflunomide precursors, were suitable for this reaction, leading to the formation of the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.

         <title>Cationic Carbene Analogues: Donor&#8208;Free Phosphenium and Arsenium Ions</title>

Donor&#8208;free, kinetically stabilized diarylphosphenium and arsenium ions were obtained using a combination of bulky rigid aryl substituents and a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in the condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron&#8208;rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in the gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents, dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density 2D Superlattices Assembled via Directional DNA Bonding</title>

Cubic, octahedral, and rhombic&#8208;dodecahedral (RD) nanoparticle (NP) films are assembled on substrates using DNA. Octahedral and RD films rearrange into novel low&#8208;density 2D structures, which are difficult to access using other methods for assembling NPs into superlattices.







Abstract
It is critical to assemble nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattices with controlled symmetries and spacings on substrates for metamaterials applications, where such structural parameters dictate their properties. Here, we use DNA to assemble anisotropic NPs of three shapes&#8212;cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra&#8212;on substrates and investigate their thermally induced reorganization into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline films. We report two new low&#8208;density 2D structures, including a honeycomb lattice based on octahedral NPs. The low&#8208;density lattices favored here are not usually seen when particles are crystallized via other bottom&#8208;up assembly techniques. Furthermore, we show that, consistent with the complementary contact model, a primary driving force for crystallization is the formation of directional, face&#8208;to&#8208;face DNA bonds between neighboring NPs and between NPs and the substrate. Our results can be used to deliberately prepare crystalline NP films with novel morphologies.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplify the Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19063-19067, August 23, 2021. </description>

Wiggling mesopores in monolithic carbon adsorbents lead to synergistic kinetic and equilibrium effects, allowing highly selective C3H6/C3H8 separation under practical dynamic conditions.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6&#8197;nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon adsorbent showed excellent dynamical separation stability, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.
