         <title>Halogen Bonding Tetraphenylethene Anion Receptors: Anion&#8208;Induced Emissive Aggregates and Photoswitchable Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding (XB) tetraphenylethene (TPE) based anion receptors are reported. The receptors exhibit a remarkable anion&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on luminescence response, in which halogen bonding anion interactions drive the formation of emissive nanoscale aggregates. Disubstituted XB TPE derivatives function as photoswitchable anion receptors, in which modulation of photostationary states is intimately related to anion affinity.







Abstract
A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported. 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulators that can be specifically activated by acidic tumor microenvironment to release immunomodulator and enhance tumor penetration are developed for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomedicine can regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumors and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes showed molecular&#8208;conformation&#8208;guided chiral hexagonal supramolecular packing and formed various helical nanoarchitectures, including unprecedented superhelices with molecular rigidity and assembly&#8208;boosted chiroptical performance.







Abstract
Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer&#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V&#8208;shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation Improves the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst improves the ethylene selectivity compared with a coated Pd monometallic catalyst. The intrinsic activity is preserved and is approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga2O3&#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H2 activation than that of Pd1Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Supported Lipid Monolayers using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free and non&#8208;destructive chemical and structural imaging of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111) is demonstrated with a spatial resolution of &#8776;20&#8197;nm using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for the first time. Ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and spatial resolution of TERS allows reproducible hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder within DPPC monolayers.







Abstract
Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8208;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Functionalized Nanowires to Construct Nanoelectrodes for Intracellular Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile one&#8208;pot synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires breaks through the limitation of nanoelectrode materials to facilely construct high&#8208;performance single nanowire electrodes. Concurrently with excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and antifouling properties, the nanowire electrodes show great superiority in real&#8208;time monitoring of biological molecules and unraveling the relevant signaling pathway inside single living cells.







Abstract
A strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes is proposed. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8211;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8211;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells.

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites improves the crystallization process. Fluoride anions selectively coordinate and remove SnIV and affect the colloidal properties in solution. This study describes the working mechanism of SnF2 and highlights the importance of solution chemistry for controlling crystallization and SnII oxidation in tin halide perovskites.







Abstract
Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of SnII to SnIV. Most of reported strategies employ SnF2 in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent SnIV formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR analysis of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for SnIV over SnII, selectively complexing it as SnF4. Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF4 than SnI4 to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of SnIV in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large band gap and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) effect are two valuable but contradictory parameters, which are difficult to balance in one infrared (IR) NLO material. Herein, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal diamond&#8208;like (DL) IR NLO material Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  , presenting a honeycomb&#8208;like 3D framework constructed by 6&#8208;membered LiS  4  rings and GeMgS  6  zigzag chains, was rationally designed and synthesized. The introduction of rigid alkali metal and alkaline&#8208;earth metal LiS  4  and MgS  4  tetrahedra effectively broadens the band gap of DL compound to 4.12 eV (the largest one in the reported quaternary metal chalcogenides), generating a high laser damage threshold of 7 &#215; AgGaS  2  at 1064 nm. Furthermore, Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  displays a suitable SHG response (0.7 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) with a type I phase&#8208;matching behavior. The results indicate that Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  is a promising IR NLO material for the high&#8208;power laser application and it provides an insight into the design of new DL compound with outstanding IR NLO performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable site&#8208;specific functionalization of DNA origami with polynucleotide brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized origami nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8208;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C  (&#947;)  bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy group, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the Pauli principle, the spin arrangements on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the spin of the shifted electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the  exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity  via the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Chalcogen Bonding and Halogen Bonding Sigma&#8208;Hole Donor Atom Potency and Selectivity for Halide Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (  3&#183;ChB  ), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5-bis-triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic-withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma-hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron-withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro- or iodo- donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma-hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty-fold and eight-fold increase in chloride anion affinity respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (  3&#183;ChB  ), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron-withdrawing ability of the Te-bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine-tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB-based receptor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable production of benzylamines from lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C  &#945;  &#8208;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C  &#946;  &#8208;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and that secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of pseudo&#8208;natural product design and formal natural product ring distortion yields stereochemically and biologically diverse pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally complex and diverse natural products (NPs) display diverse biological activities and inspire the synthesis of new bioactive compound classes. We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combination of the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) whose different scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Cheminformatic analysis and morphological profiling in the cell painting assay revealed that the resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids are both chemically and biologically diverse, and that biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with an undesirable heating damage to normal organs nearby due to its high temperature (&gt;50  o  C) for available tumor ablation. Achieving PTT strategies at a relatively low temperature therefore demonstrates tremendous value to clinic. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4, 4'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of APACPs are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of Hsp90&#945; for reducing thermal&#8208;resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT. This strategy provides a promising method for gene editing targeting tumor microenvironments, and opens a possibility to improve the therapeutic effect and minimize the side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly System for the Construction of a Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a promising avenue to treat and eradicate cancer. However, the significantly different physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and drug molecules hinder the potential direct integration of these two agents into a single particle, limiting the construction of an ideal delivery system to achieve synergistic antitumor effectiveness. Herein, we developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. Therefore, more drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid&#8208;based drug formulation, facilitating future development of drug&#8208;delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Tolerant Covalent Organic Framework Electrolyte with Holistically Oriented Channels for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window and high mechanical strength is the key to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently attracted considerable interests as promising SSEs mainly due to their highly tunable molecular structures and ideally well&#8208;ordered ion migration channels. Herein, we design and synthesize flexible high&#8208;voltage tolerant COF SSE films with holistically oriented channel structure to enable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811) for the first time. By rationally introducing lithium&#8208;philic groups and electrochemical stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkage, the as&#8208;prepared COFs demonstrated large bandgap with ultralow HOMO value (&#8211;6.2 eV under vacuum) and the highest oxidative stability up to 5.6 V (versus Li  +  /Li) among all the COF SSEs. Upon convenient mechanical assembly under pre&#8208;heat treatment, the obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5 &#215; 10  &#8211;4  S cm  &#8211;1  at 60 &#176;C, and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young&#8217;s modulus of 10.5 GPa. The lithium ions transmission in this COF SSE was revealed to exhibit directional hopping paths and fast drift velocity by molecular dynamic simulations. With such multiple features, we employed this COF SSE film to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries with NMC811 cathode, which demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400 cycles, high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%) and could also withstand abuse test such as folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolution of Li deposition vs intercalation of graphite anodes in lithium ion batteries &#8208; an in situ electron paramagnetic resonance study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plating of lithium on a graphite anode is the main barrier to fast charging of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in addition to causing serious capacity fade and safety issues. Here, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) electrochemical spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Our results indicate that classical &#8216;over&#8208;charging&#8217; (normally associated with potentials &#8804; 0 V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04 V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate lowered to 0.04 mV s&#8208;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by the vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, which is attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer, with higher ionic conductivity. Finally a safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05 V for the graphite anode is suggested for high rate cycling, which is confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The plating of lithium on a graphite anode is the main barrier to fast charging of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in addition to causing serious capacity fade and safety issues. Here, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) electrochemical spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Our results indicate that classical &#8216;over-charging&#8217; (normally associated with potentials &#8804; 0 V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04 V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate lowered to 0.04 mV s-1. The inhibition of Li deposition by the vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, which is attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer, with higher ionic conductivity. Finally a safe cut-off potential limit of +0.05 V for the graphite anode is suggested for high rate cycling, which is confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advection&#8208;enhanced kinetics in microtiter plates for improved surface assay quantitation and multiplexing capabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface assays such as ELISA are pervasive in clinics and research and predominantly standardized in microtiter plates (MTP). MTPs provide many advantages but are often detrimental to surface assay efficiency due to inherent mass transport limitations. Microscale flows can overcome these and largely improve assay kinetics. However, the disruptive nature of microfluidics with existing labware and protocols has narrowed its transformative potential. We present WellProbe, a novel microfluidic concept compatible with MTPs. With it, we show that immunoassays become more sensitive at low concentrations (up to 9&#215; signal improvement in 12x less time), richer in information with 3&#8208;4 different kinetic conditions, and can be used to estimate kinetic parameters, minimize washing steps and non&#8208;specific binding, and identify compromised results. We further multiplex single&#8208;well assays combining WellProbe&#8217;s kinetic regions with tailored microarrays. Finally, we demonstrate our system in a context of immunoglobulin subclass evaluation, increasingly regarded as clinically relevant.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8216;synthetic antibody&#8217; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer&#8208;based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8216;best&#8217; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis A Virus Cell Receptor&#8208;1 protein, also known as KIM&#8208;1 and TIM&#8208;1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane using Stable Solid&#8208;Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient and direct conversion of methane under mild conditions is of great significance to the innovation of the chemical industry. However, the efficiency and lifetime of most catalysts remain too far from the practical requirement, since it is difficult to break the first C&#8208;H bond of methane as well as to suppress the following complete dehydrogenation (or overoxidation) and the resulting carbonaceous deposition (or CO  2  ). Here, we report that wurtzite GaN:ZnO solid solutions exhibit unique and unprecedented photocatalytic performances for the nonoxidative coupling of methane at room temperature, exclusively generating ethane with nearly stoichiometric H  2  . High conversion rate (&gt; 330 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  ), long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 70 h), and superior coke&#8208;resistance were achieved. At 293 K, the methane conversion exceeds 7%, comparable to the equilibrium conversion of thermal catalysis at 910 K. Mechanism studies revealed that the N&#8208;Zn  Ga  &#8208;O  N  units and the absence of acid sites of surface played crucial roles in reactivity and coke&#8208;resistance, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy and antagonism between allosteric and active&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, &#8216;conformation&#8208;selective&#8217; ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, a methyl group on the classic tetramethylcyclam (TMC) ligand framework is replaced with a benzylic group to form the metastable [Fe  IV  (O  syn  )(Bn3MC)]  2+  (  2  &#8208;  syn  ; Bn3MC = 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) species at &#8208;40 &#176;C.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells&#160;and Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. Herein we report an efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed coupling of&#160;  N  &#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of &#160;an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of&#160;  N  &#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. More importantly,&#160;we successfully develop&#160; three fluorophore&#8208;tagged Rh(III)&#8208;based fluorogenic probes (coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes,&#160;  CEPs  ) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the probes,&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;exhibited the&#160; highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52 ppb in air. Furthermore,&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;was &#160;successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and&#160;  Arabidopsis  &#160;thaliana  &#160;plants. These results indicated that&#160;  CEP&#8208;1  &#160;has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unprecedented, efficient nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay for the remote cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of  &#946;  &#8208;bromo&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;benzylamino acid esters with aryl bromides  via  1,4&#8208;aryl migration/arylation cascades.  &#946;  &#8208;Bromo&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;benzylamino acid esters are considered as unique molecular scaffolds allowing for the aryl migration reactions, which are conceptually novel variants for the radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement. This reaction enables the formation of two new C(sp  3  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bonds using a bench&#8208;stable Ni/bipyridine/Zn system featuring a broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity, which provides an effective platform for the remote aryl group migration and arylation of amino acid esters  via  redox&#8208;neutral C(sp  3  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond cleavage. Mechanistically, this cascade reaction is accomplished by combining two powerful catalytic cycles consisting of a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and radical 1,4&#8208;aryl migration through the generation of C(sp  3  )&#8208;centred radical intermediates from the homolysis of C(sp  3  )&#8208;Br bonds and the switching of the transient alkyl radical into a robust &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adjacent Atomic Platinum Site Enables Single&#8208;Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst of Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC with Fe&#8208;N4 and Pt&#8208;N4 dual atomic sites. The enhancement for the ORR activity is demonstrated by the modulation effect: Pt&#8208;N4 plays the role in modulating the Fe&#8208;N4 active center to optimize the ORR performance. The modulation effect is not effective for the enhancement of ORR performance in the systems of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC.







Abstract
The modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt&#8208;N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#916;E1/2=8&#8197;mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 systems.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Radical Conjugate Addition Reactions: An Expanding Toolkit for the Giese Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.







Abstract
Photomediated Giese reactions are at the forefront of radical chemistry, much like the classical tin&#8208;mediated Giese reactions were nearly forty years ago. With the global recognition of organometallic photocatalysts for the mild and tunable generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals, chemists have developed a torrent of strategies to form previously inaccessible radical intermediates that are capable of engaging in intermolecular conjugate addition reactions. This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.

         <title>Efficient Electroconversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by a Reconstructed Amino&#8208;Functionalized Indium&#8211;Organic Framework Electrocatalyst</title>

The amino&#8208;functionalized reconstructed indium&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst demonstrates a high activity for carbon dioxide electroconversion to formate in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.







Abstract
We report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.

The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium-based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino-functionalized indium-based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid-phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas-phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysis and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing one oxygen by one sulfur per monomer converts native oligonucleotides that cannot enter cells into cell&#8208;penetrating oligophosphorothioates. The reason for this is thiol&#8208;mediated uptake: dynamic covalent exchange with cellular thiols and disulfides that can be inhibited and activated according to the principles of dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom. They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA. Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials. However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown. Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake. The transient adaptive network produced by dynamic covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action. Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.

         <title>Rationalizing the Unprecedented Stereochemistry of an Enzymatic Nitrile Synthesis through a Combined Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.







Abstract
In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a smaller cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme, with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe was utilized.

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning dispersity and molecular weight distribution shape significantly impacts polymer properties. Herein, we report a straight&#8208;forward approach, wherein blending just two polymers allows for unrivalled precision in tuning molecular weight distributions.







Abstract
The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &#272; and one of low &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.

         <title>Principles of Water Electrolysis and Recent Progress in Cobalt&#8208;, Nickel&#8208;, and Iron&#8208;Based Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review describes the basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and significant criteria for the development of new catalysts. Recent advances in catalysts based on Co, Ni, and Fe oxides are described, and a brief perspective is given on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Water electrolysis that results in green hydrogen is the key process towards a circular economy. The supply of sustainable electricity and availability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are the main bottlenecks of the process for large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen. A broad range of OER electrocatalysts have been explored to decrease the overpotential and boost the kinetics of this sluggish half&#8208;reaction. Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been considered to be potential candidates to replace noble metals due to their tunable 3d electron configuration and spin state, versatility in terms of crystal and electronic structures, as well as abundance in nature. This Review provides some basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of OER, and significant criteria for the development of the catalysts. It provides also some insights on recent advances of Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based oxides and a brief perspective on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.

         <title>Tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine Backbone for Highly Efficient Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Completely Horizontal Molecular Orientation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The expansion of TBPZ acceptor plane well&#8208;controlled the excited states involving 1CT, 3CT and 3LE states, which enhances the kRISC by remarkably shorting of the &#964;d and induced a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM. Consequently, PQ3 displayed an orange red EL max at 586&#8197;nm, PLQY of ca. 83&#8201;%, kRISC of 8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#964;d of 2.7&#8197;&#956;s, S values of &#8722;0.49, and deliver high EQE of 27.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.

Particularly, the well-aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge-transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in &lt;b&gt;PQ3&lt;/b&gt; enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) with a short delay lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on &lt;b&gt;PQ3&lt;/b&gt; displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well-suppressed EL efficiency roll-off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.&lt;/p&gt;

Current approaches for m  6  A modified RNA analysis limit at bulk&#8208;population level, resulting in a loss of spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. Here we proposed a m  6  A&#8208;specific  in situ  hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA) for cellular imaging of m  6  A RNA, allowing to identify m  6  A modification at specific location in RNAs and image m  6  A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution. Using m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA, we investigated the m  6  A level and subcellular location of HSP70 RNA103&#8208;m  6  A in each cell in response to heat shock, and found an increased m  6  A modified ratio and an increased distribution ratio in cytoplasm under heat shock stress. m  6  AISH&#8208;PLA can serve in the study of m  6  A RNA in single&#8208;cell for deciphering epitranscriptomic mechanisms and assisting clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclo&#8208;naphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C&#8208;NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n&#8208;type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;&#8208;positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;promoted macrocyclization route. Thiophene&#8208;thiophene junction in [4]C&#8208;NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs with both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C60.&#160; Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules with impressive characteristics present the great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for development of multifunctional organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low&#8208;cost and readily available reagent. This light&#8208;mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers an C&#8722;O bond fragmentation. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF  3  CO radical under photoredox&#160; conditions. Remarkably, the trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simple changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of small&#8208;molecule drugs and common pharmacophores.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disilenes with differently coordinated silicon atoms are not known. Here, we have shown the high yield synthesis of a range of disilenes (  2  &#8208;  4  and  6  ) upon reaction of a hypersilyl silylene PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  SiSi(SiMe  3  )  3  (  1  ) with aliphatic chlorophosphines. The most striking characteristic of these disilenes is the presence of two differently coordinated Si atoms (one is three&#8208;coordinated, the other four&#8208;coordinated). The analogous reaction with Ph  2  PCl did not afford the desired disilene, but, surprisingly, led to the first tetraphosphinosilane (  8  ). DFT calculations were performed to understand the bonding in disilenes and differences in reactivity of the complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases and Li&#8208;ion Flux/Solvation with Qua&#8208;functional Heptafluorobutyric Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety and electrochemical performance of rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are primarily influenced by the additives in the organic liquid electrolytes. However, multi&#8208;functional additives are still rarely reported. Herein, we proposed heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) as a qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reduction/oxidation decomposition of the fluorine&#8208;rich HFA facilitate uniform inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, which enables stable lithium plating during charge and suppresses the dissolution of transition&#8208;metal ions. Moreover, HFA optimizes the Li&#8208;ion solvation for stable Li plating/stripping and serves as the surfactant to enhance the wettability of the separator by the electrolyte to increase Li&#8208;ion flux. The symmetric Li||Li cell with 1.0 wt% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340 h at 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 while the Li||NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250 cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15C.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Structure&#8211;Selectivity Correlations in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2: A Comparison of Well&#8208;Ordered Atomically Clean and Chemically Etched Copper Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces affect their CO2RR selectivity. Clean, flat, atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; but these actually favor production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. Structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.







Abstract
The identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to specific chemical products is elusive, owing in part to insufficient data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO2RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; however, these were found experimentally to favor the production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example by electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, are significant amounts of hydrocarbons generated. These results show that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy Using Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed highly selective C1&#8722;C8 bond cleavage of BCBs with the insertion of alkynes was achieved by the assistance of a removable blocking group. This method provided an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical approach to structurally important 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediols under pH&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.

         <title>Photo Click Reaction of Acylsilanes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photoreaction occurs under mild conditions mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals. The potential of the method is documented by the successful coupling of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids and by the conjugation of polymers.







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415&#8197;nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8208;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.

         <title>Water Oxidation under Modal Ultrastrong Coupling Conditions Using Gold/Silver Alloy Nanoparticles and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricated a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles, a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal ultrastrong coupling conditions and applied the photoanode to a water oxidation reaction. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% of maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency, obtained at 580&#8197;nm. These results derive from the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency owing to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement.







Abstract
We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520&#8197;meV, which can be categorized into the ultrastrong coupling regime. We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE), obtained at 580&#8197;nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1&#8201;%. These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed, with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70&#8201;% for O2 evolution.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO  2  is a promising route to provide sustainable fuels. The performance is still unsatisfactory mainly due to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO  2  is reduced to methanol with 100% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9% (&#955; = 420 nm) is 300% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT can be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a unique strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous enhancement of magnetic resonance signals using a RASER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance is usually drastically limited by its intrinsically low sensitivity: Only a few spins contribute to the overall signal. To overcome this limitation, hyperpolarization methods were developed that increase signals several times beyond the normal/thermally polarized signals. The ideal case would be a universal approach that can signal enhance the complete sample of interest in solution to increase detection sensitivity. Here, we introduce the combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal. We demonstrate that this is not only possible for solvent molecules but also for an amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient site&#8208;selective desymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;dienes is reported. This protocol allows rapid access to a wide range of chiral allylic alcohols and amides bearing two vicinal chiral centers adjacent to the alkene. The utility of this method is further highlighted by the synthesis of the alkyl side chain of zaragozic acid&#8197;A and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;invictolide.







Abstract
The control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes via iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of meso dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxy oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products zaragozic acid&#8197;A and (+)&#8208;invictolide.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenophene end&#8208;capped asymmetric heteroheptacene core is used to construct an efficient nonfullerene acceptor (MQ6) which shows increased carrier transport due to the enhanced O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se intramolecular noncovalent interaction as well as the increased dipole moment. MQ6 exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 16.39&#8201;% when blended with a wide band gap copolymer.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5, MQ6) are synthesized using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores with selenophene heterocycles. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se compared to that of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64&#8201;% compared to MQ3, which shows a PCE of 13.51&#8201;%. Based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows an improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. MQ6 exhibits a PCE of 16.39&#8201;% with a VOC of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a JSC of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes integrated with perylene diimide is developed. The macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The porous supramolecular structures display micropore characteristics and charge transporting properties.







Abstract
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral ortho&#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8211;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. A moderate electron mobility of 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.

Forging of the 20&#8208;membered macrocylic core of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A can be readily achieved by combining a Mo&#8208;catalysed one&#8208;pot alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis ring&#8208;closing metathesis of bisalkyne building blocks and Ru&#8208;catalysed hydrometallation chemistry. These key transformations have enabled the first total synthesis of this anti&#8208;malarial C2&#8208;symmetric macrodiolide.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis&#8211;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8211;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].

         <title>Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free&#8208;Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine&#8208;Based Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual&#8208;mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and peroxide&#8208;free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain&#8208;growth modes.







Abstract
Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization&#8208;initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free&#8208;radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical&#8208;propagation process. The benefit of this dual&#8208;mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes.

         <title>Monitoring Metabolites Using an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive Polymer Dot and a Metabolite&#8208;Specific Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabolite biosensor is developed by integrating an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dot and a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme. Metabolite concentration can be measured ratiometrically with high sensitivity and specificity. Phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma is shown for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantitation of other disease&#8208;related metabolites, and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphone imaging.







Abstract
We introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627&#8197;nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458&#8197;nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8208;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8208;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.







Abstract
A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.

Abstract
A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was used for the synthesis of symmetric or dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) with different numbers of selenophene. From S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl to A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and to S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl, a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed. A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl. The dissymmetric A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;based device has a PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary polymer solar cells. The combination of dissymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is effective to improve Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc.

We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.







Abstract
Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (.CH3 in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.

         <title>Synergistic Lysozyme&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy Against Resistant Bacteria based on an Intelligent Upconversion Nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohybrid UCMB&#8208;LYZ&#8208;HP was designed with features of intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive release of lysozyme and NIR&#8208;triggered high production of 1O2. By synergistically combining the enzymatic and photodynamic effect, the nanohybrid exhibited an extraordinary antibacterial capacity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue infections caused by resistant bacteria.







Abstract
The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Now we designed a bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus. These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.

         <title>Intracellular Protein&#8211;Drug Interactions Probed by Direct Mass Spectrometry of Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells, based on our direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. We demonstrate label&#8208;free analysis of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and measurement of the binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples.







Abstract
Understanding protein&#8211;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8211;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.

         <title>Revision of the Unstable Picrotoxinin Hydrolysis Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of picrotoxinin (PXN), which is a plant metabolite that is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling, in weakly alkaline media gives an unstable hydrolysis intermediate that was initially assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. This assignment however has been shown to be in error on the basis of the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrolysis product in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.







Abstract
The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.

         <title>A Borondifluoride&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Photothermal Agent with an 80% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Photothermal Therapy in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) that absorb in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) window are highly desirable in photothermal therapy for their good biocompatibility and deeper tissue penetration. However, the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that molecular engineering of BF2 complex via strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation and increasing the intramolecular motions is an efficient strategy to achieve NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs with high photothermal performance. Based on this strategy, a BF2 complex, BAF4, was designed and synthesized. BAF4 exhibits an intense absorption maximum at 1000 nm and negligible fluorescence. Notably, the nanoparticles of BAF4 achieve a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80% under 1064 nm laser irradiation (0.75 W cm&#8208;2). In vitro and in vivo studies reveal the great potential of BAF4 nanoparticles in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the undesired Zn corrosion and Zn dendrite formation in aqueous electrolyte, most of the reported excellent performance of aqueous Zn batteries is achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6 %) in anode and low mass&#8208;loading (&lt;3 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) in cathode. Herein, we propose a new organic electrolyte for Zn batteries, which contains a zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn&#8208;TFMS) salt and a mixture solvent of propylene carbonate (PC) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). We demonstrate that this electrolyte with optimized PC/TEP ratio not only exhibits high ionic conductivity and wide stable potential window, but also facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping. Especially, the TEP solvent endows the electrolyte non&#8208;flammability. Finally, a 2 V Zn//polytriphenylamine composite (PTPAn) battery is fabricated by using the optimized electrolyte, which shows high rate and a long&#8208;life (2,400 cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading (16 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) of PTPAn in cathode and with a high utilization of Zn anode (3.5 %).</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective, Scalable Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic O&#8208;Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of aryl&#8208;alkyl ether bonds through cross coupling of alcohols with aryl halides represents a useful strategic departure from classical S  N  2 methods. Numerous tactics relying on Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g. Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e&#8208;etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding&#160;the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates towards electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we combine experimental evidence and theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co  3+  and Co  4+  species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co  3+  is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co  4+  is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As results, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiaromatic 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>s&#8208;Indacene is a classical nonalternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Here, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine via a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diarylacethylenes followed by a hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, which manifests in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. Compared to the parent&#160;s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability due to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables the fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8211;B bond of a di(  o  &#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a  cis  &#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8211;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a 'retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift', which can be considered as an  anti  &#8208;&#120573;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Counterion Control of t&#8208;BuO&#8208;Mediated Single Electron Transfer to Nitrostilbenes to Construct N&#8208;Hydroxyindoles or Oxindoles</title>

tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks divergent reactivity embedded in nitrostilbenes to construct N&#8208;hydroxyindoles or oxindoles depending on whether sodium or potassium is the counterion.







Abstract
tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks new reactivity patterns embedded in nitroarenes. Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium tert&#8208;butoxide was found to produce N&#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or N&#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chiral mesostructured BiOBr film exhibiting a chirality&#8208;dependent circularly polarized colour response due to the structural&#8208;handedness matching and synergistic effect of multiple optical activities.







Abstract
Achieving strong and broadband circularly polarized colour responses in chiral inorganic materials is challenging. Here, we fabricated chiral mesostructured bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) films (CMBFs) via hydrothermal growth using chiral sugar alcohols as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. The layered slabs of BiOBr crystals with weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangements of fine size. Three levels of chirality exist in the CMBFs: primary, helical distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary, helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and tertiary, chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range of 350&#8211;2500&#8197;nm with an anisotropic factor of up to 0.99, which led to a significant chirality&#8208;dependent colour response to circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the result of enhanced resonance due to structural&#8208;handedness matching and the synergistic effect of multiple OAs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.







Abstract
We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonation towards pyrrole and indole polycyclic scaffolds featuring five&#8208;, six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings, with tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The process can be coupled with the desymmetrization of prochiral centers to obtain pyrrole&#8208; and indole&#8208;fused scaffolds with either vicinal or skipped stereocenters. DFT studies shed light on the mechanism and key stereodetermining factors.







Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Covalent Organic Framework Staggered Stacking Nanosheet Membrane for CO2&#8208;Selective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of lamellar COFs were exfoliated into discrete nanosheets with large aspect&#8208;ratios. The nanosheets were assembled into ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional membranes with staggered stacking patterns, respectively. Taking advantage of narrowed pore size and CO2&#8208;philic adsorption, these single&#8208;phase COF nanosheet membranes were characterized by superior CO2/H2 separation performances.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light&#8208;weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely&#8208;tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single&#8208;phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro&#8208;structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2&#8208;philic separation performances, among which TpPa&#8208;2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2/H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298&#8197;K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

         <title>The Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction Directing the Design of Single Atomic Site Catalysts: Achieving High Efficiency Towards Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) is closely related to the electronic structure of active sites, which determines the catalytic activity. We put forward a method of designing the EMSI of single&#8208;atomic site catalysts (SACs) to achieve high efficiency. The SACs achieve a lower overpotential and higher mass activity than any other SACs towards hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the benefits of this method.







Abstract
It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22&#8197;mV and 86&#8197;mV at the at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 (vs. 192.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (&#8776;20&#8201;% electricity consuming decrease at 2&#8197;kA&#8201;m&#8722;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrid catalyst with abundant Zn defects exhibits an outstanding OER performance, demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. DFT calculations reveal that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defects can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve intrinsic catalytic performance. This study provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterojunctions with defects.







Abstract
Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve activity of metal sulfide. However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

         <title>Silicon Naphthalocyanine Tetraimides: Cathode Interlayer Materials for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiNcTI&#8208;Br with strong self&#8208;doping property, high conductivity, and high electron mobility is an excellent cathode interlayer material. The interlayer boosts the power conversion efficiency of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs to 16.71&#8201;%. It is the first naphthalocyanine derivatives used as interlayer material in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Naphthalocyanine derivatives (SiNcTI&#8208;N and SiNcTI&#8208;Br) were firstly used as excellent cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) in organic solar cells, via introducing four electron&#8208;withdrawing imide groups and two hydrophilic alkyls. Both of them showed deep LUMO energy levels (below &#8722;3.90&#8197;eV), good thermal stability (Td &gt;210&#8201;&#176;C), and strong self&#8208;doping property. The SiNcTI&#8208;Br CIM displayed high conductivity (4.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (7.81&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which could boost the efficiencies of the PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs over a wide range of CIM layer thicknesses (4&#8211;25&#8197;nm), with maximum efficiency of 16.71&#8201;%.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Enabled para&#8208;Selective Trifluoromethylation of tert&#8208;Butyl Arylcarbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using the Langlois reagent. Arylcarbamates, including the bioactive compound chlorzoxazone, vorinostat precursor, chlorpropham, and teriflunomide precursors, were suitable for this reaction, leading to the formation of the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.

         <title>Engineering Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase To Enable the Highly selective Decarboxylation of trans Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high risk of heart disease caused by the intake of  trans  fatty acids, a method to eliminate  trans  fatty acids from foods has become a critical issue. Herein, we engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from  Chlorella variabilis  (  Cv  FAP) to selectively catalyze the decarboxylation of  trans  fatty acids to yield readily&#8208;removed hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, while  cis  fatty acids remained unchanged. An efficient protein engineering based on FRISM strategy was implemented to intensify the electronic interaction between the residues and the double bond of the substrate that stabilized the binding of elaidic acid in the channel. For the model compounds, oleic acid and elaidic acid, the best mutant, V453E, showed a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold improvement in the  trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis  (  ToC  ) selectivity compared with wild type (WT). As the first report of the direct biocatalytic decarboxylation resolution of  trans  /  cis  fatty acids, this work offers a safe, facile, and eco&#8208;friendly process to eliminate  trans  fatty acids from edible oils.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring ultrafast photoswitching pathways in RbMnFe Prussian Blue Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study by femtosecond optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in the RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Previous studies evidenced the local nature of the photoinduced Mn  III  Fe  II  &#8208;&#8208;&gt; Mn  II  Fe  III  process, occurring within less than 1 ps. Here we show experimentally that two photoswitching pathways exist, depending on the excitation pump wavelength, which is confirmed by band structure calculations. Photoexcitation of a spins corresponds to the Mn(d&#8208;d) band, which drives reverse Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion through the population of antibonding Mn&#8208;N orbitals, and induces CT within ~190 fs. The process launches coherent lattice torsion during the self&#8208;trapping of the CT small&#8208;polaron. Photoexcitation of b spins drives intervalence Fe&#8208;&#8208;&gt;Mn CT towards non&#8208;bonding states and results in a slower dynamic.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Platinum&#8211;Cobalt Nano&#8208;alloys in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles confined on the inner and outer surfaces of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (Pt&#8208;Co@NCNT) have been synthesized through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach. With the structural and compositional merits, the Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst presents superior activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media for the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with closed ends. During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption for hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rhn cluster cocatalyst with Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 delivers a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, which benefits from a bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction mechanism, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites aided by hydrogen atom transfer to adjacent Rh0 sites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remain a challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Herein, we design a Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The turnover frequency (TOF) achieves 416.73&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only with Rh3+ species. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization shows the OER process on the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The DFT calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New telluronium salts exhibit enhanced properties due to the presence of 3 &#963;&#8208;holes. This is highlighted in solution by Ph3PO&#8208;binding studies through 17O, 31P, and 125Te NMR as well as mass spectrometry and NOESY NMR. The enhanced chalcogen&#8208;bonding properties translated into high catalytic performance, with low loadings (0.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (5&#8197;min&#8211;2&#8197;h), and high yields.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid, but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalysts. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic properties at low loadings in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8211;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder between Danishefsky's diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (17O, 31P, and 125Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.

         <title>Structural Basis for Isomerization Reactions in Fungal Tetrahydroxanthone Biosynthesis and Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel isomerase NsrQ from Aspergillus novofumigatus is a key enzyme for the structural diversification of the fungal tetrahydroxanthones. The crystal structures of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3 in complex with substrate analogues provided a structural basis for the dual isomerization reactions. These findings will lead to mechanistic understanding of the diversification and the stereochemical control in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis.







Abstract
The novel isomerase NsrQ, from Aspergillus novofumigatus, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and is responsible for dearomatizing cyclization to provide a tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two&#8208;step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at the methyl group. We report on the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ, and its homologue Dcr3, from Diaporthe longicolla. The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the nuclear transport factor 2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.

         <title>A Chemiluminescent Tetraaryl Diborane(4) Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of boron doping with an antiaromaticity/aromaticity switch allowed the preparation of a unique diborane(4) tetraanion. Air oxidation leads to blue chemiluminescence, while controlled two&#8208;electron oxidation furnishes a dianionic diborene. The reactivities of the compounds are characterized by boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H activation, single electron transfers, and Stone&#8211;Wales&#8208;type rearrangements.







Abstract
Two subvalent, redox&#8208;active diborane(4) anions, [3]4&#8722; and [3]2&#8722;, carrying exceptionally high negative charge densities are reported: Reduction of 9&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene with Li granules without stirring leads to the crystallization of the B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp2) diborane(5) anion salt Li[5]. [5]&#8722; contains a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl&#8208;bridged B&#8722;B core, a chelating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl moiety, and a MeO substituent. Reduction of Li[5] with Na metal gives the Na+ salt of the tetraanion [3]4&#8722; in which two doubly reduced 9&#8208;borafluorenyl fragments are linked via a B&#8722;B single bond. Comproportionation of Li[5] and Na4[3] quantitatively furnishes the diborane(4) dianion salt Na2[3], the doubly boron&#8208;doped congener of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bis(fluorenylidene). Under acid catalysis, Na2[3] undergoes a formal Stone&#8211;Wales rearrangement to yield a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivative with B=B core. Na2[3] shows boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity toward n&#8208;butyl chloride. Na4[3] produces bright blue chemiluminescence when exposed to air.

         <title>Insight into the Alkaline Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ammonium Groups for Anion&#8208;Exchange Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores the alkaline stability and degradation mechanism of 24 representative N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium groups and poly(aryl piperidinium)&#8208;based polyelectrolytes for anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), providing a clear guideline for design of highly stable anion&#8208;exchange membranes and ionomers. The structure&#8211;durability relationship between ammonium groups, anion&#8208;exchange polyelectrolytes, and AEMFCs was revealed.







Abstract
The alkaline stability of N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium (NHA) groups is a critical topic in anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs) and AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a systematic study on the alkaline stability of 24 representative NHA groups at different hydration numbers (&#955;) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The results elucidate that &#947;&#8208;substituted NHAs containing electron&#8208;donating groups display superior alkaline stability, while electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents are detrimental to durable NHAs. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations and experimental results suggest that nucleophilic substitution is the dominant degradation pathway in NHAs, while Hofmann elimination is the primary degradation pathway for NHA&#8208;based AEMs. Different degradation pathways determine the alkaline stability of NHAs or NHA&#8208;based AEMs. AEMFC durability (from 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) suggests that NHA&#8208;based AEMs are mainly subjected to Hofmann elimination under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density for 1000&#8197;h, providing insights into the relationship between current density, &#955; value, and durability of NHA&#8208;based AEMs.

The results elucidate that &#947;-substituted NHAs containing electron-donating groups display superior alkaline stability, while electron-withdrawing substituents are detrimental to durable NHAs. Density-functional-theory calculations and experimental results suggest that nucleophilic substitution is the dominant degradation pathway in NHAs, while Hofmann elimination is the primary degradation pathway for NHA-based AEMs. Different degradation pathways determine the alkaline stability of NHAs or NHA-based AEMs. AEMFC durability (from 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) suggests that NHA-based AEMs are mainly subjected to Hofmann elimination under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density for 1000&#8197;h, providing insights into the relationship between current density, &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; value, and durability of NHA-based AEMs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Heteroacenes that Contain Two Boron Atoms: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Based on a Push&#8211;Pull Effect**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Push&#8211;pull modification of acene scaffolds by incorporation of two electron&#8208;accepting boron atoms and two electron&#8208;donating planarized phenyl ether moieties renders the resulting compounds near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active. Of particular note is a thienothiophene&#8208;centered 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused diboraheteroacene that exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a narrow band width.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient heteroacenes that contain two tricoordinate boron atoms in their acene skeletons and planarized phenyl ether moieties at their periphery were synthesized via the borylation of silicon&#8208;bridged precursors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed quinoidal structures, which give rise to two&#8208;step reversible redox processes for both the reduction and oxidation. These compounds exhibit intense absorption and sharp fluorescence bands with vibronic structures in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. These properties originate from the push&#8211;pull effect along the long axis of the molecule derived from the electron&#8208;donating ether moieties and the electron&#8208;accepting boron moieties. Of particular note is the NIR emission of the thienothiophene&#8208;centered heteroacene, which has a maximum at 952&#8197;nm with a narrow band width of 309&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in cyclohexane. A Franck&#8211;Condon analysis revealed the crucial role of the sterically less&#8208;hindered thienothiophene spacer in achieving this sharp emission band.

         <title>Editing Light Emission with Stable Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks via Wall Surface Perturbation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization enables the construction of highly emissive stable covalent organic frameworks linked by hydrazone bond. Perturbation of pore wall surface site can tune the emission to achieve three primary colors of light, rendering the materials able to edit various emission colors by organizing different surface sites onto the pore wall.







Abstract
The ordered &#960; skeletons of covalent organic frameworks make them viable light&#8208;emitting materials but their limited tunability has precluded further implementation. Here we report the synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;linked frameworks which are stable in water, acid, and base, and demonstrate their utility as a platform for light emission. The polygonal backbone is designed to be luminescent and partially &#960; conjugated while the pore wall is docked with single atom or unit to induce resonance, hyperconjugation, and tautomerization effects. These effects can be transmitted to the backbone, so that the framework can emit three primary colors of light. The wall can be perturbated with multiple surface sites, rendering the material able to edit diverse emission colors in a predesignable and digital way. The systems show high activity, stability, tunability, and sensibility: a set of features attractive for light&#8208;emitting and sensing applications.

         <title>Surface Density Dependent Catalytic Activity of Single Palladium Atoms Supported on Ceria**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on CeO2 deviate from the assumption of constant specific activity as a function of Pd loading. CO oxidation activity increases as more Pd is loaded, but once nanoparticles form, dramatic deactivation is observed. Pd supported on Al2O3 does not exhibit this phenomenon, demonstrating that the reducibility of the support is an important factor.







Abstract
The analogy between single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and molecular catalysts predicts that the specific catalytic activity of these systems is constant. We provide evidence that this prediction is not necessarily true. As a case in point, we show that the specific activity over ceria&#8208;supported single Pd atoms linearly increases with metal atom density, originating from the cumulative enhancement of CeO2 reducibility. The long&#8208;range electrostatic footprints (&#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) around each Pd site overlap with each other as surface Pd density increases, resulting in an observed deviation from constant specific activity. These cooperative effects exhaust previously active O atoms above a certain Pd density, leading to their permanent removal and a consequent drop in reaction rate. The findings of our combined experimental and computational study show that the specific catalytic activity of reducible oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts can be tuned by varying the surface density of single metal atoms.

         <title>From Selection to Instruction and Back: Competing Conformational Selection and Induced Fit Pathways in Abiotic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic hosts use both conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms to capture guests. In this regard, the order by which encapsulation takes place can easily be directed for applications such as tuning the action of allosteric molecular machines and increasing their operational efficiency.







Abstract
Two limiting cases of molecular recognition, induced fit (IF) and conformational selection (CS), play a central role in allosteric regulation of natural systems. The IF paradigm states that a substrate &#8220;instructs&#8221; the host to change its shape after complexation, while CS asserts that a guest &#8220;selects&#8221; the optimal fit from an ensemble of preexisting host conformations. With no studies that quantitatively address the interplay of two limiting pathways in abiotic systems, we herein and for the first time describe the way by which twisted capsule M&#8208;1, encompassing two conformers M&#8208;1(+) and M&#8208;1(&#8722;), trap CX4 (X=Cl, Br) to give CX4&#8834;M&#8208;1(+) and CX4&#8834;M&#8208;1(&#8722;), with all four states being in thermal equilibrium. With the assistance of 2D EXSY, we found that CBr4 would, at its lower concentrations, bind M&#8208;1 via a M&#8208;1(+)&#8594;M&#8208;1(&#8722;)&#8594;CBr4&#8834;M&#8208;1(&#8722;) pathway corresponding to conformational selection. For M&#8208;1 complexing CCl4 though, data from 2D EXSY measurements and 1D NMR line&#8208;shape analysis suggested that lower CCl4 concentrations would favor CS while the IF pathway prevailed at higher proportions of the guest. Since CS and IF are not mutually exclusive, we reason that our work sets the stage for characterizing the dynamics of a wide range of already existing hosts to broaden our fundamental understanding of their action. The objective is to master the way in which encapsulation takes place for designing novel and allosteric sequestering agents, catalysts and chemosensors akin to those found in nature.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Carboxylic Acid Co&#8208;Catalysis Enables Oxidative Esterification of Demanding Aldehydes/Enals, at Low Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed oxidative esterification of aldehydes/enals is synthetically highly attractive, it is plagued by poor conversions/yields for sterically demanding substrates. The triazolium catalyst shown, with benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, overcomes this deficiency. A variety of hitherto recalcitrant aldehydes/enals are efficiently converted to esters with very low catalyst loadings (down to 50&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
We report the discovery that simple carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, boost the activity of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts in the oxidative esterification of aldehydes. A simple and efficient protocol for the transformation of a wide range of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals, catalyzed by a novel and readily accessible N&#8208;Mes&#8208;/N&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt, and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, was developed. A whole series of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals hitherto not amenable to NHC&#8208;catalyzed esterification could be reacted at typical catalyst loadings of 0.02&#8211;1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%. For benzaldehyde, even 0.005&#8197;mol&#8201;% of NHC catalyst proved sufficient: the lowest value ever achieved in NHC catalysis. Preliminary studies point to carboxylic acid&#8208;induced acceleration of acyl transfer from azolium enolate intermediates as the mechanistic basis of the observed effect.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplify the Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wiggling mesopores in monolithic carbon adsorbents lead to synergistic kinetic and equilibrium effects, allowing highly selective C3H6/C3H8 separation under practical dynamic conditions.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6&#8197;nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon adsorbent showed excellent dynamical separation stability, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;size&#8208;induced band gap tuning in perovskite films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive picture explaining the effect of the crystal size in metal halide perovskite films on their opto&#8208;electronic characteristics is currently lacking. We report that perovskite nanocrystallites exhibit a wider band gap due to concurrent quantum confinement and size dependent structural effects, with the latter being remarkably distinct and attributed to the perturbation from the surface of the nanocrystallites affecting the structure of their core. This phenomenon might assist in the photo&#8208;induced charge separation within the perovskite in devices employing mesoporous layers as they restrict the size of nanocrystallites present in them. We demonstrate that the crystal size effect is widely applicable as it is ubiquitous in different compositions and deposition methods employed in the fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the art perovskite solar cells. This effect is a convenient and effective way to tune the band gap of perovskites, thus shedding light on the path forward for the design of perovskite devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Opto&#8208;electrochemical Dissolution Reveals Coccolith Calcium Carbonate Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coccoliths are plates of biogenic calcium carbonate secreted by calcifying marine phytoplankton; annually these phytoplankton are responsible for exporting &gt;1 billion tonnes (10  15  g) of calcite to the deep ocean. Rapid and reliable methods for assessing the degree of calcification are technically challenging because the coccoliths are micron sized and contain picograms (pg) of calcite. Here we pioneer an opto&#8208;eletrochemical acid titration of individual coccoliths which allows 3D reconstruction of each individual coccolith via in situ optical imaging enabling direct inference of the coccolith mass. Coccolith mass ranging from 2 to 400 pg are reported herein, evidencing both inter&#8208;  and  intra&#8208;species variation over four different species. We foresee this scientific breakthrough, which is independent of knowledge regarding the species and calibration&#8208;free, will allow continuous monitoring and reporting of the degree of coccolith calcification in the changing marine environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesized catalyst towards acidic oxygen reduction by deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells. However, many aspects of the catalytic process are still uncertain, especially the large difference in activity in acidic and alkaline media. Thus, the design and synthesis of model catalysts to determine the active centres and the inactivation mechanism are urgently needed. In this work, we reported a pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesis route to fabricate a catalyst (CPF&#8208;Fe@NG) for acidic oxygen reduction. By introducing a deprotonation process, we extended the ORR (Oxygen Reduction Reaction) activity from alkaline to acidic conditions. CPF&#8208;Fe@NG demonstrated outstanding performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 853 mV (vs. RHE) and good stability after 10000 cycles in 1 M HClO4  . The pyrolysis&#8208;free route could also be used to assemble fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 126 mW cm&#8208;2  . Our findings offer new insights into the ORR process to optimize catalysts for both mechanistic studies and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A couple of fluorescent enantiomers, which are suitable for the emitters of high&#8208;efficiency TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs, have been developed. The enantiomers show configurational stability, high PLQY of 98%, large k  r  of 7.8&#215;10  7  s  &#8208;1  , and intense CPL activities with |g  lum  | values of about 2.5 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  . Notably, by using matchable TADF sensitizer, the enantiomers were then exploited as emitter to fabricate CP&#8208;OLEDs. The TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs not only show mirror&#8208;image CPEL activities with g  EL  values of +1.8&#215;10  &#8208;3  and &#8208;1.4&#215;10  &#8208;3  , but also display fast start&#8208;up featuring with low V  T  of 3.0 V as well as driving voltage of 4.84 V at 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  . Meaningfully, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices show high EQE  max  of 21.5% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQEs are 21.2% and 15.3% at 1000 and 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  , respectively. The results are even better than those of CP&#8208;TADF emitters, which provides a promising perspective to break through the EL efficiency limit of CP&#8208;FL emitters.</dc:description>

To date, studies on&#160;regulated ligands mainly focus on individual DNA secondary topologies, while lack focus on quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids (QDHs). Here, we design an organic&#8208;metal hybrid ligand  L  1  Pt(dien)  , which matches and selectively binds one type of QDHs with lateral duplex stem&#8208;loop (QLDH) with high affinity, while shows poor affinity for other QDHs and individual G4 or duplex DNA. The solution structure of QLDH MYT1L&#8722;  L  1  Pt(dien)  complex was determined by NMR. The structure reveals that  L  1  Pt(dien)  presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, showing a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode. Our work provided guidance for spatial matching design of selectively targeting ligands to QDH structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Au55 with a Novel Structure and Remarkable CO2 Electroreduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a novel  Au  55  nanocluster with the composition of [Au  55  (p&#8208;MBT)  24  (Ph  3  P)  6  ](SbF  6  )  3  (p&#8208;MBT = 4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) has been synthesized via direct reduction of gold&#8208;phosphine and gold&#8208;thiolate precursors. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that this  Au  55  nanocluster features a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Au  55  kernel, different from the well&#8208;known two&#8208;shell cuboctahedral arrangement in Au  55  (Ph  3  P)  12  Cl  6  proposed by Schmid et al. The  Au  55  cluster shows a wide optical&#8208;absorption band with optical energy gap (E  g  = 1.28 eV). It is found that the exclusion of chloride is crucial for the formation of the title cluster, otherwise rod&#8208;like [Au  25  (SR)  5  (PPh  3  )  10  Cl  2  ]  2+  is obtained. The strategy to run synthetic reaction in the presence of no halide opens the door to new members of phosphine/thiolate co&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. The  Au  55  nanocluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO  2  to CO, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1% at &#8208;0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Tripyridinium&#8208;Triazine Molecule: Radicals Stabilization Enabling Reversible Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel organic molecule, 2,4,6&#8208;tris[1&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridiniumyl]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine hexachloride, is developed as a reversible six&#8208;electron storage electrolyte for aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB). Physicochemical characterizations reveal that the molecule evolves from radical to biradical and finally to quinoid structure upon accepting four electrons. Both the diffusion coefficient and the rate constant are found sufficiently high for running a flow battery with low concentration and kinetics polarization losses. As demonstration, the assembled flow battery affords a high specific capacity of 33.0 Ah L  &#8208;1  and a peak power density of 273 mW cm  &#8208;2  . This work highlights the rational design of electroactive organics that can manipulate multi&#8208;electron transfer in a reversible way, which will pave the way to develop energy&#8208;dense, manageable and lost&#8208;cost ARFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Dirhodium Artificial Metalloenzymes for Diazo Coupling Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are commonly used to control the stereoselectivity of catalytic reactions, but controlling chemoselectivity remains challenging. In this study, we engineer a dirhodium ArM to catalyze diazo cross&#8208;coupling to form an alkene that, in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction, is reduced to an alkane with high enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99% e.e.) by an alkene reductase. The numerous protein and small molecule components required for the cascade reaction had minimal effect on ArM catalysis. Directed evolution of the ArM led to improved yields and E/Z selectivities for a variety of substrates, which translated to cascade reaction yields. MD simulations of ArM variants were used to understand the structural role of the cofactor on ArM conformational dynamics. These results highlight the ability of ArMs to control both catalyst stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity to enable reactions in complex media that would otherwise lead to undesired side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Mechanistic Studies of the Iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkenylation of Enamides with Vinyl Acetates: A Versatile Approach for Ketone Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketone functionalization has been a cornerstone in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe the development of an intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with feedstock chemical vinyl acetate to access diverse functionalized ketones. Enamides derived from various cyclic and acyclic ketones react efficiently and a number of sensitive functional groups are tolerated. In this Ir&#8208;catalyzed transformation two structurally and electronically similar alkenes&#8212;enamide and vinyl acetate&#8212;are selectively cross&#8208;coupled through C&#8722;H activation. The reaction does not need any partner used in large excess. In addition, it is pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;neutral with HOAc as the only stoichiometric byproduct. Detailed experimental and computational studies of the reaction mechanism reveal a pathway involving a 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8722;C migratory insertion followed by a  syn  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxyl elimination, which is different from the prior vinyl acetate&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation reactions. Finally, the alkenylation product can serve as a versatile intermediate to deliver a variety of structurally modified ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethane&#8208;Based Catalytic Process for Vinyl Chloride Manufacture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of ethane as a platform molecule for the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a longstanding challenge, which would allow to reduce the raw material costs and CO2&#160;emissions to produce this plastic.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Material Based on Catechol Modified Self&#8208;Immolative Poly(Disulfide) Backbones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials engineered to degrade upon triggering are in high demand due their potentially lower impact on the environment as well as their use in sensing and in medical applications. Here, stimuli&#8209;responsive polymers are prepared by decorating a self&#8208;immolative poly(dithiothreitol) backbone with pendant catechol units. The highly functional polymer is fashioned into stimuli&#8209;responsive gels, formed through pH dependent catecholato&#8208;metal ion cross&#8208;links. The gels degrade in response to specific environmental changes, either by addressing the pH responsive, non&#8208;covalent, catecholato&#8208;metal complexes, or by addition of a thiol. The latter stimulus triggers end&#8209;to&#8209;end depolymerization of the entire self&#8208;immolative backbone through end&#8209;cap replacement via thiol&#8208;disufide exchanges. Gel degradation is visualized by release of a dye from the supramolecular gel as it itself is converted into smaller molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Borane&#8211;(Meth)acrylate Photo&#8208;Click Reaction</title>

N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes can lead to a photochemically triggered borane&#8211;acrylate click reaction, a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction. Because boranes have three substituents they can participate in cross&#8208;linking, unlike thiols in thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate reactions. This generates materials with improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
In the development of 3D printing fuels, there is a need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8211;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.

         <title>Molecularly Compensated Pre&#8208;Metallation Strategy for Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries and Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17070-17079, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly compensated pre&#8208;metallation strategy triggered by Kolbe electrolysis has been successfully achieved for the construction of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors. Notably, the electrochemical oxidation potential of the metal carboxylate is modulated by the bonding energy of the oxygen&#8211;metal moiety, which is further manipulated by the electronic structure of the substituent and the hardness/softness of metal element.







Abstract
The use of a sacrificial cathode additive as a pre&#8208;metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre&#8208;metallation technique suffers from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre&#8208;metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of a metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of the oxygen&#8211;metal (O&#8211;M) moiety. The electron&#8208;donating effect of the substituent and the low charge density of the cation can dramatically weaken the O&#8211;M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre&#8208;sodiation feature for sodium&#8208;ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, remarkably delivering 70.6&#8201;% enhanced capacity retention in comparison to the additive&#8208;free system after 100&#8197;cycles. This methodology has been extended to construct a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery and a lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion capacitor.

Due to the spin&#8208;forbidden nature, it remains challenging to achieve room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials with high quantum yields. We report a highly efficient dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system enabled by TADF mechanism to realize afterglow quantum yields of 60&#8211;70&#8201;%, which features a moderate rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing to simultaneously improve afterglow quantum yields and maintain afterglow emission lifetime.







Abstract
We report a highly efficient dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system enabled by TADF mechanism to realize afterglow quantum yields of 60&#8211;70&#8201;%, which features a moderate rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) to simultaneously improve afterglow quantum yields and maintain afterglow emission lifetime. Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) compounds are designed with multiple electron&#8208;donating groups to possess moderate kRISC values and are selected as luminescent dopants. The matrices with carbonyl functional groups such as phenyl benzoate (PhB) have been found to interact with and perturb BF2bdk excited states by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and thus enhance the intersystem crossing of BF2bdk excited states. Through dopant&#8208;matrix collaboration, the efficient TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials have been achieved to exhibit excellent processability into desired shapes and large&#8208;area films by melt casting, as well as aqueous afterglow dispersions for potential bioimaging applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation over Pd/ZnO&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Role of Palladium&#8211;Zinc Alloy in Selective Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17053-17059, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this operando study of methanol synthesis over Pd/ZnO catalysts, we show that the palladium&#8211;zinc alloy phase by itself is not particularly good at selectively hydrogenating carbon dioxide. Instead, and in the absence of a co&#8208;existing zinc oxide phase, the palladium&#8211;zinc alloy primarily yields carbon monoxide. When zinc oxide and palladium&#8211;zinc alloy nanoparticles are both present, the system becomes a far more active and selective catalyst.







Abstract
Pd/ZnO catalysts show good activity and high selectivity to methanol during catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The Pd&#8208;Zn alloy phase has usually been considered as the active phase, though mechanistic studies under operando conditions have not been conducted to verify this. Here, we report a mechanistic study under realistic conditions of methanol synthesis, using in situ and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and time&#8208;resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with FTIR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Pd&#8208;Zn alloy&#8208;based catalysts, prepared through reduction of a heterobimetallic PdIIZnII acetate bridge complex, and which do not contain zinc oxide or any PdZn/ZnO interface, produce mostly CO. The Pd&#8208;Zn phase is associated with the formation of CO, and does not provide the active sites required to produce methanol from the direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The presence of a ZnO phase, in contact with a Pd&#8208;Zn phase, is essential for efficient methanol production.

Instead, and in the absence of a co-existing zinc oxide phase, the palladium&#8211;zinc alloy primarily yields carbon monoxide. When zinc oxide and palladium&#8211;zinc alloy nanoparticles are both present, the system becomes a far more active and selective catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd/ZnO catalysts show good activity and high selectivity to methanol during catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. The Pd-Zn alloy phase has usually been considered as the active phase, though mechanistic studies under operando conditions have not been conducted to verify this. Here, we report a mechanistic study under realistic conditions of methanol synthesis, using in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and time-resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with FTIR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Pd-Zn alloy-based catalysts, prepared through reduction of a heterobimetallic Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; acetate bridge complex, and which do not contain zinc oxide or any PdZn/ZnO interface, produce mostly CO. The Pd-Zn phase is associated with the formation of CO, and does not provide the active sites required to produce methanol from the direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The presence of a ZnO phase, in contact with a Pd-Zn phase, is essential for efficient methanol production.&lt;/p&gt;

Using a modified infrared reflection accessory designed for high throughput saliva analysis we show proof of concept of a COVID&#8208;19 point&#8208;of&#8208;care screening device.







Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID&#8208;19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose&#8208;built transflection accessory for rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of COVID&#8208;19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM&#8208;IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by RT&#8208;qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93&#8201;% (27/29) with a specificity of 82&#8201;% (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT&#8208;qPCR. Herein, we demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high throughput infrared COVID&#8208;19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self&#8208;collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Thiocarbonylation of Alkynes toward Linear and Branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Thioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17178-17184, July 26, 2021. </description>

A ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is reported. Various linear and branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters are produced in a straightforward manner. This protocol is characterized by its ligand&#8208;controlled regioselectivity pattern, wide substrate scope, and unprecedented functional group compatibility. This is the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.







Abstract
Thiocarbonylation of alkynes offers an ideal procedure for the synthesis of unsaturated thioesters. A robust ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is developed. Utilizing boronic acid and 5&#8208;chlorosalicylic acid as the acid additive to in situ form 5&#8208;chloroborosalicylic acid (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;BSA), and bis(2&#8208;diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEphos) as the ligand, linear &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters were produced in a straightforward manner. Switching the ligand to tri(2&#8208;furyl)phosphine can turn the reaction selectivity to give branched products. Remarkably, this approach also represents the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.

         <title>Identification of a Pyrrole Intermediate Which Undergoes C&#8208;Glycosidation and Autoxidation to Yield the Final Product in Showdomycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17148-17154, July 26, 2021. </description>

C&#8208;nucleoside biosynthesis: The biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;nucleoside showdomycin was reconstituted in vitro. Key steps include cyclization of l&#8208;glutamine to yield an oxygen&#8208;labile pyrrole intermediate that serves as the substrate for C&#8208;glycosidation catalyzed by SdmA. Autoxidative maturation of the pyrrole nucleobase to the maleimide moiety of showdomycin can then proceed non&#8208;enzymatically.







Abstract
Showdomycin is a C&#8208;nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the C&#8208;glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5&#8208;phosphate, the resulting C&#8208;nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic C&#8208;nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities.

         <title>Strategic Design of Catalytic Lysine&#8208;Targeting Reversible Covalent BCR&#8208;ABL Inhibitors**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Using iminoboronate chemistry, we report the first successful examples of catalytic lysine&#8208;targeting reversible covalent BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors which inhibited both ABLWT and ABLT315I at nanomolar potency. We also demonstrated how the study of off&#8208;targets for this class of compounds could be performed using activity&#8208;based protein profiling and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors have re&#8208;emerged as validated drugs to overcome acquired resistance in cancer treatment. Herein, by using a carbonyl boronic acid (CBA) warhead, we report the structure&#8208;based design of BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors via reversible covalent targeting of the catalytic lysine with improved potency against both wild&#8208;type and mutant ABL kinases, especially ABLT315I bearing the gatekeeper residue mutation. We show the evolutionarily conserved lysine can be targeted selectively, and the selectivity depends largely on molecular recognition of the non&#8208;covalent pharmacophore in this class of inhibitors, probably due to the moderate reactivity of the warhead. We report the first co&#8208;crystal structures of covalent inhibitor&#8208;ABL kinase domain complexes, providing insights into the interaction of this warhead with the catalytic lysine. We also employed label&#8208;free mass spectrometry to evaluate off&#8208;targets of our compounds at proteome&#8208;wide level in different mammalian cells.

         <title>Constructing an Acidic Microenvironment by MoS2 in Heterogeneous Fenton Reaction for Pollutant Control</title>

We have successfully constructed an acidic microenvironment on the surface of CoFe2O4 by chemical bonding MoS2, which ensures the stable circulation of iron ions in the slipping plane and truly overcomes the limitation of pH in pollutant control, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.







Abstract
Although Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions have been widely used in the environment, biology, life science, and other fields, the sharp decrease in their activity under macroneutral conditions is still a large problem. This study reports a MoS2 cocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton (CoFe2O4/MoS2) system capable of sustainably degrading organic pollutants, such as phenol, in a macroneutral buffer solution. An acidic microenvironment in the slipping plane of CoFe2O4 is successfully constructed by chemically bonding with MoS2. This microenvironment is not affected by the surrounding pH, which ensures the stable circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+ on the surface of CoFe2O4/MoS2 under neutral or even alkaline conditions. Additionally, CoFe2O4/MoS2 always exposes &#8220;fresh&#8221; active sites for the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of 1O2, effectively inhibiting the production of iron sludge and enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants, even in actual wastewater. This work not only experimentally verifies the existence of an acidic microenvironment on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts for the first time, but also eliminates the pH limitation of the Fenton reaction for pollutant remediation, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.

         <title>On the Biology of Werner's Complex</title>

Werner's Complex (WC) has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle it displays &#956;m antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of the properties of this iconic compound.







Abstract
Werner's Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner's Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of a Chemically Stable Aza&#8208;Bridged Bis(phenanthroline) Macrocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>

A 2D aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline)&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;linked conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed by periodically linking hexaaza&#8208;triphenylene units together using the linkage of the aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline) macrocycle in the absence of solvents and catalysts. The bulk insulating COF pellet became semiconducting after exposure to iodine vapor.







Abstract
Developing new linkage&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is one of the major topics in reticular chemistry. Electrically conductive COFs have enabled applications in energy storage and electrochemical catalysis, which are not feasible using insulating COFs. Despite significant advances, the construction of chemically stable conductive COFs by the formation of new linkages remains relatively unexplored and challenging. Here we report the solvent&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline) macrocycle&#8208;linked COF (ABBPM&#8208;COF) from the thermally induced poly&#8208;condensation of a tri&#8208;topic monomer and ammonia gas. The ABBPM&#8208;COF structure was elucidated using multiple techniques, including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis combined with structural simulation, revealing its crystalline nature with an ABC stacking mode. Further experiments demonstrated its excellent chemical stability in acid/base solutions. Electrical&#8208;conductivity measurements showed that the insulating ABBPM&#8208;COF becomes a semiconducting material after exposure to iodine vapor.

         <title>Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2</title>

Nickel phthalocyanine molecules as active sites were installed into nickel&#8208;catecholate&#8208;linked 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets for efficient CO2 electroreduction with nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising approach to realize a carbon&#8208;energy balance. However, low current density still limits the application of the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising alternatives for the CO2RR due to their periodically arranged isolated metal active sites. However, the poor conductivity of traditional MOFs usually results in a low current density in CO2RR. We have prepared conductive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based MOF (NiPc&#8208;NiO4) nanosheets linked by nickel&#8208;catecholate, which can be employed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to CO. The obtained NiPc&#8208;NiO4 has a good conductivity and exhibited a very high selectivity of 98.4&#8201;% toward CO production and a large CO partial current density of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming the reported MOF catalysts. This work highlights the potential of conductive crystalline frameworks in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Cleavage of the N&#8801;N Triple Bond and Unpredicted Formation of the Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diaza&#8208;2,4&#8208;Diborete (FB)2N2 from N2 and Fluoroborylene BF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17205-17210, July 26, 2021. </description>

The four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF is obtained from fluoroborylene, FB, and N2. It shows a complete cleavage of the N2 triple bond and a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;bond conjugated with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs, indicating the importance of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions.







Abstract
A complete cleavage of the triple bond of N2 by fluoroborylene (:BF) was achieved in a low&#8208;temperature N2 matrix by the formation of the four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF, which lacks a trans&#8208;annular N&#8722;N bond. Additionally, the linear complex FB=N&#8722;N=BF and cyclic FB(&#951;2&#8208;N2) were formed. These novel species were characterized by their matrix infrared spectra and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The puckered four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring B2N2 complex shows a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;system in conjugation with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs.

     alt="Cleavage of the N&#8801;N Triple Bond and Unpredicted Formation of the Cyclic 1,3-Diaza-2,4-Diborete (FB)2N2 from N2 and Fluoroborylene BF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-membered heterocycle FB(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF is obtained from fluoroborylene, FB, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It shows a complete cleavage of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; triple bond and a delocalized aromatic two-electron &#960;-bond conjugated with the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs, indicating the importance of fluorine-specific interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete cleavage of the triple bond of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by fluoroborylene (:BF) was achieved in a low-temperature N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix by the formation of the four-membered heterocycle FB(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF, which lacks a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-annular N&#8722;N bond. Additionally, the linear complex FB=N&#8722;N=BF and cyclic FB(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were formed. These novel species were characterized by their matrix infrared spectra and quantum-chemical calculations. The puckered four-membered-ring B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex shows a delocalized aromatic two-electron &#960;-system in conjugation with the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs. This work may contribute to a rational design of catalysts based on borylene for artificial dinitrogen activation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Ultralong Phosphorescence with Lifetime over 5 s for Reversible Water&#8208;Jet Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Printing</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials responsive to water have been achieved, showing phosphorescent quantum yield of 16.1&#8201;% and lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s. Lifetime&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns are jet&#8208;printed using water as ink on the water&#8208;responsive OURTP paper and erased by solvent fuming with high reversibility and cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with photophysical properties sensitive to external stimulus are highly attractive for advanced applications. However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus&#8208;responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong&#8208;lived and deep&#8208;blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Host&#8211;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H&#8208;bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s at room temperature. They are sensitive to water, which can strength the H&#8208;bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1&#8201;% to 37.6&#8201;%. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper was easily prepared for water&#8208;jet printing; the jet&#8208;printed high&#8208;resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.

Human biofluids provide systemic molecular information. By combining vibrational spectroscopy, biochemical fractionation, and mass spectroscopic proteomic profiling of blood serum, we extend the molecular understanding of the infrared spectral fingerprints of human blood. Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we provide a general framework informative for the future of disease probing.







Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy of liquid biopsies is a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective approach that may advance biomedical diagnostics. However, the molecular nature of disease&#8208;related changes of infrared molecular fingerprints (IMFs) remains poorly understood, impeding the method's applicability. Here we probe 148 human blood sera and reveal the origin of the variations in their IMFs. To that end, we supplemented infrared spectroscopy with biochemical fractionation and proteomic profiling, providing molecular information about serum composition. Using lung cancer as an example of a medical condition, we demonstrate that the disease&#8208;related differences in IMFs are dominated by contributions from twelve highly abundant proteins&#8212;that, if used as a pattern, may be instrumental for detecting malignancy. Tying proteomic to spectral information and machine learning advances our understanding of the infrared spectra of liquid biopsies, a framework that could be applied to probing of any disease.

         <title>Merging Electron Transfer with 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement: Deoxygenative Arylation of Aromatic Amides with Arylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17088-17093, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient protocol for deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond cross coupling of aromatic amides with air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable arylboronic esters is achieved, affording a series of biologically important diarylmethylamines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The key to this success is proposed to be the merging of electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced activation of the amide by Sm/SmI2 with boron 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement.







Abstract
Amides are essentially inert carboxyl derivatives in many types of chemical transformations. In particular, deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond formation of amides to synthetically important amines is a long&#8208;standing challenge for synthetic chemists due to the inertness of the resonance&#8208;stabilized amide C=O bond. Herein, it is disclosed that by merging electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced activation with 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement, a wide range of aromatic amides react smoothly with arylboron reagents, affording a series of biologically relevant diarylmethylamines as deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond cross&#8208;coupling products. With its simplicity and versatility, this reaction shows great promise in the synthesis of amines from amides, which may open up new avenues in retrosynthetic planning and find widespread use in academia and industry.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B and Analogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17045-17052, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immunosuppressive natural products, sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B, bearing a 22&#8208;membered macrocycle appended with a unique highly&#8208;substituted spirolactam, pose formidable challenges to synthetic accessibility and derivatization. A versatile strategy toward the spirolactam through convergent assembly of fully&#8208;functionalized fragments culminated in the total synthesis of sanglifehrin&#8197;A and sanglifehrin&#8197;B and preparation of additional analogs at position C40 for evaluation of biological activity in Jurkat cells and stabilization of protein&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B are immunosuppressive macrocyclic natural products endowed with and differentiated by a unique spirocyclic lactam. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis and biological evaluation of sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B and analogs. Access to the spirocyclic lactam was achieved through convergent assembly of a key pyranone intermediate followed by a stereo&#8208;controlled spirocyclization. The 22&#8208;membered macrocyclic core was synthesized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis in the presence of 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) benzeneboronic acid (BFBB). The spirocyclic lactam and macrocycle fragments were united by a Stille coupling to furnish sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B. Additional sanglifehrin B analogs with variation at the C40 position were additionally prepared. Biological evaluation revealed that the 2&#8208;CF3 analog of sanglifehrin B exhibited higher anti&#8208;proliferative activity than the natural products sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B in Jurkat cells. Both natural products induced higher&#8208;order homodimerization of cyclophilin&#8197;A (CypA), but only sanglifehrin&#8197;A promoted CypA complexation with inosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate dehydrogenase&#8197;2 (IMPDH2). The synthesis reported herein will enable further evaluation of the spirolactam and its contribution to sanglifehrin&#8208;dependent immunosuppressive activity.

An efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via in situ activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt was developed. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis.







Abstract
We report an efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via in situ activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis, including complex drug&#8208;like scaffolds. Stoichiometric experiments and kinetic analysis suggest a unique mechanism involving C&#8722;P reductive elimination to form the Xantphos phosphonium chloride, which subsequently initiates an unusual halogen exchange by outer sphere nucleophilic substitution.

         <title>Optimal Pore Chemistry in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Benchmark Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17198-17204, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208; or electron&#8208;transfer strategy within confined pore space is reported for the design of CO2&#8208;selective ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with specific pore environments. Using this strategy, high CO2 capacities and high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt; 99.9%) were obtained as proven by fixed bed breakthrough experiments.







Abstract
Isolation of CO2 from acetylene (C2H2) via CO2&#8208;selective sorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for C2H2 purification, but a strategic challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. There is still no specific methodology for constructing sorbents that preferentially trap CO2 over C2H2. We report an effective strategy to construct optimal pore chemistry in a CeIV&#8208;based ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework CeIV&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F, based on charge&#8208;transfer effects, for efficient inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer is facilitated by CeIV with low&#8208;lying unoccupied 4f orbitals and electron&#8208;withdrawing F atoms functionalized tetrafluoroterephthalate, affording a perfect pore environment to match CO2. The exceptional CO2 uptake (151.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3) along with remarkable separation selectivities (above 40) set a new benchmark for inverse CO2/C2H2 separation, which is verified via simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments. The unique CO2 recognition mechanism is further unveiled by in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and molecular calculations.

         <title>Highs and Lows of Bond Lengths: Is There Any Limit?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17028-17036, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonds cannot be compressed or elongated at will. Two bond&#8208;length keepers watch for the stability of chemical bonds by imposing limits that cannot be exceeded. At short distances, the hard&#8208;sphere boundary prevents the interaction from becoming positive. At long distances, the spinodal condition prevents the bond force constant to be negative. Both are intrinsic consequences of the bond length at equilibrium.







Abstract
Two distinct points on the potential energy curve (PEC) of a pairwise interaction, the zero&#8208;energy crossing point and the point where the stretching force constant vanishes, allow us to anticipate the range of possible distances between two atoms in diatomic, molecular moieties and crystalline systems. We show that these bond&#8208;stability boundaries are unambiguously defined and correlate with topological descriptors of electron&#8208;density&#8208;based scalar fields, and can be calculated using generic PECs. Chemical databases and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations are used to analyze a full set of diatomic bonds of atoms from the s&#8208;p main block. Emphasis is placed on the effect of substituents in C&#8722;C covalent bonds, concluding that distances shorter than 1.14&#8197;&#197; or longer than 2.0&#8197;&#197; are unlikely to be achieved, in agreement with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;pressure data and transition&#8208;state distances, respectively. Presumed exceptions are used to place our model in the correct framework and to formulate a conjecture for chained interactions, which offers an explanation for the multimodal histogram of O&#8722;H distances reported for hundreds of chemical systems.

A borane&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between a benzyl&#8208;protected 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline and an alkynone has been developed. The reaction consists of hydride transfer and enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition, which are both promoted by the spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisborane catalysts.







Abstract
Herein, we present a mild and efficient method for synthesizing enantioenriched tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused cyclobutenes through a cascade reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines and alkynones with catalysis by chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes. The bisboranes served two functions: first they catalyzed a hydride transfer to convert the 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline substrate to a 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline, and then they activated the alkynone substrate for an enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline generated in situ.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Activity&#8208;Based E2&#8208;Ubiquitin Probes for the Structural Analysis of E3 Ligase&#8208;Catalyzed Transthiolation</title>

A structurally new activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probe that closely resembles the native E2&#8764;Ub thioester has been developed and used for structural analysis of Cys&#8208;dependent E3 ligases&#8208;catalyzed transthiolation. This new probe is readily prepared in an expedient total chemical synthesis of atomically&#8208;tailored E2 enzyme variant using hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based E2 conjugating enzyme (E2)&#8208;ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for studying the molecular mechanism of E3 ligase (E3)&#8208;catalyzed ubiquitination. However, the preparation of existing activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probes depends on recombination technology and bioconjugation chemistry, limiting their structural diversity. Herein we describe an expedient total chemical synthesis of an E2 enzyme variant through a hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation, which enabled the construction of a structurally new activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probe to covalently capture the catalytic site of Cys&#8208;dependent E3s. Chemical cross&#8208;linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) demonstrated the utility of this new probe in structural analysis of the intermediates formed during Nedd4 and Parkin&#8208;mediated transthiolation. This study exemplifies the utility of chemical protein synthesis for the development of protein probes for biological studies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity-based E2 conjugating enzyme (E2)-ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for studying the molecular mechanism of E3 ligase (E3)-catalyzed ubiquitination. However, the preparation of existing activity-based E2-Ub probes depends on recombination technology and bioconjugation chemistry, limiting their structural diversity. Herein we describe an expedient total chemical synthesis of an E2 enzyme variant through a hydrazide-based native chemical ligation, which enabled the construction of a structurally new activity-based E2-Ub probe to covalently capture the catalytic site of Cys-dependent E3s. Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) demonstrated the utility of this new probe in structural analysis of the intermediates formed during Nedd4 and Parkin-mediated transthiolation. This study exemplifies the utility of chemical protein synthesis for the development of protein probes for biological studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Kirkendall Effect Boosts Phosphorylated nZVI for Efficient Heavy Metal Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17115-17122, July 26, 2021. </description>

Radial nanocracks in phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) favor the facile inward diffusion of NiII and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (NiII/electron) and boundary (NiII/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollowing phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize NiII throughout the oxide shell with a high capacity.







Abstract
Removal of non&#8208;biodegradable heavy metals has been the top priority in wastewater treatment and the development of green technologies remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate that phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) is promising for removal of heavy metals (NiII, CuII, CrVI, HgII) via a boosted Kirkendall effect. Phosphorylation confines tensile hoop stress on the nZVI particles and &#8220;breaks&#8221; the structurally dense spherical nZVI to produce numerous radial nanocracks. Exemplified by NiII removal, the radial nanocracks favor the facile inward diffusion of NiII and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (NiII/electron) and boundary (NiII/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollowing phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize NiII throughout the oxide shell with a high capacity (258&#8197;mg&#8201;Ni&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;Fe). For real electroplating factory wastewater treatment, this novel nZVI performs simultaneous NiII and CuII removal, producing effluent of stable quality that meets local discharge regulations.

         <title>Mode&#8208;Specific Vibrational Analysis of Exciton Delocalization and Structural Dynamics in Conjugated Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16999-17008, July 26, 2021. </description>

Detailed pictures of exciton delocalization and structural dynamics of archetypical conjugated oligomers are provided with the aid of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Raman frequency dispersions in the S1 state and their time&#8208;dependent kinetics suggest the close connection between exciton delocalization and local structures of conjugated materials.







Abstract
Exciton delocalization in organic semiconducting polymers, affected by structures at a molecular level, plays a crucial role in modulating relaxation pathways, such as charge generation and singlet fission, which can boost device efficiency. However, the structural diversity of polymers and broad signals from typical electronic spectroscopy have their limits when it comes to revealing the interplay between local structures and exciton delocalization. To tackle these problems, we apply femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy in archetypical conjugated oligothiophenes with different chain lengths. We observed Raman frequency dispersions of symmetric bond stretching modes and mode&#8208;specific kinetics in the S1 Raman spectra, which underpins the subtle and complex interplay between exciton delocalization and bond length alternation along the conjugation coordinate. Our results provide a more general picture of exciton delocalization in the context of molecular structures for conjugated materials.

         <title>Exploration of the Reactivity of Multivalent Electrophiles for Affinity Labeling: Sulfonyl Fluoride as a Highly Efficient and Selective Label</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17080-17087, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical probes were prepared by multivalently presenting electrophilic groups and ligands on gold nanoparticles (NPs), and their reactivities as novel affinity labeling probes were explored. An arylsulfonyl fluoride probe at a nm concentration achieved an efficient and selective labeling of model proteins in cell lysate. The NP&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride groups can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site.







Abstract
Here we explored the reactivity of a set of multivalent electrophiles cofunctionalized with a carbohydrate ligand on gold nanoparticles to achieve efficient affinity labeling for target protein analysis. Evaluation of the reactivity and selectivity of the electrophiles against three different cognate binding proteins identified arylsulfonyl fluoride as the most efficient protein&#8208;reactive group in this study. We demonstrated that multivalent arylsulfonyl fluoride probe 4 at 50&#8197;nm concentration achieved selective affinity labeling and enrichment of a model protein PNA in cell lysate, which was more effective than photoaffinity probe 1 with arylazide group. Labeling site analysis by LC&#8211;MS/MS revealed that the nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride group can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site of the target proteins. Our study highlights the utility of arylsulfonyl fluoride as a highly effective multivalent affinity label suitable for covalently capturing unknown target proteins.

Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a critical RNA modification, dysregulation of which is linked with autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and several types of cancer. Here, we develop a protein&#8208;based chemiluminescent bioassay to rapidly characterize global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, addressing a significant technological need for studying RNA editing and its relationship with disease.







Abstract
Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a conserved eukaryotic RNA modification that contributes to development, immune response, and overall cellular function. Here, we utilize Endonuclease&#8197;V (EndoV), which binds specifically to inosine in RNA, to develop an EndoV&#8208;linked immunosorbency assay (EndoVLISA) as a rapid, plate&#8208;based chemiluminescent method for measuring global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in cellular RNA. We first optimize and validate our assay with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. We then demonstrate rapid detection of inosine content in treated cell lines, demonstrating equivalent performance against current standard RNA&#8208;seq approaches. Lastly, we deploy our EndoVLISA for profiling differential A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, illustrating the utility of our platform as a diagnostic bioassay. Together, the EndoVLISA method is cost&#8208;effective, straightforward, and utilizes common laboratory equipment, offering a highly accessible new approach for studying A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing. Moreover, the multi&#8208;well plate format makes this the first assay amenable for direct high&#8208;throughput quantification of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing for applications in disease detection and drug development.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Nano&#8208;Superstructure towards Enzyme Mimicking Hydrolysis</title>

The peptide nano&#8208;superstructure employs a cyclic dipeptide as a building block, is inspired by the coffee roasting process, and can be easily synthesized. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst displays enzyme&#8208;like hydrolysis activity, with exceptional stability and recyclability. This catalytic peptide assembly provides a potent complement for minimalistic biocatalysts and offers an attractive alternative to the current arsenal of natural metalloenzymes.







Abstract
The structural arrangement of amino acid residues in native enzymes underlies their remarkable catalytic properties, thus providing a notable point of reference for designing potent yet simple biomimetic catalysts. Herein, we describe a minimalistic approach to construct a dipeptide&#8208;based nano&#8208;superstructure with enzyme&#8208;like activity. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst comprises one peptide as a single building block, readily synthesized from histidine. Through coordination with zinc ion, the peptide self&#8208;assembly procedure allows the formation of supramolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet ordered nanocrystals, which can be used as basic units to further construct higher&#8208;order superstructure. As a result, remarkable hydrolysis activity and enduring stability are demonstrated. Our work exemplifies the use of a bioinspired supramolecular assembly approach to develop next&#8208;generation biocatalysts for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 17018-17027, July 26, 2021. </description>

Utorubicin (UTO) is a novel anthracycline with higher anticancer activity than doxorubicin in cultured cancer cells. Nanoencapsulation of UTO in polymeric vesicles functionalized with tumor&#8208;penetrating peptides increases the cytotoxicity of the drug in receptor&#8208;positive cells in vitro and, after systemic administration into mice bearing triple&#8208;negative tumors, potentiates UTO accumulation in malignant tissue.







Abstract
Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.

A snapshot of blood serum composition reflects the health state of an individual. It can be obtained using infrared spectroscopy in a simple and inexpensive manner, but the molecular nature of the disease&#8208;related changes therein remains poorly understood. In their Research Article on page&#8197;17060, Liudmila Voronina, Mihaela &#381;igman et&#8197;al. used proteomics to reveal a set of proteins that contribute the most to infrared absorption of blood serum and show that they create a distinct signature of lung cancer.

A new anthracycline, utorubicin (UTO), with more potent anticancer activity than the clinically used doxorubicin was synthetized and encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes) by Lorena Sim&#243;n&#8208;Gracia, Tambet Teesalu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;17018. The polymersomes were functionalized with tumor penetrating peptides (TPP) that specifically target cancer cells. In breast tumor mice, the TTP coating enhanced the tumor homing of the systemically administered UTO polymersomes.

Biocatalytic late&#8208;stage modifications offer attractive methods to selectively functionalise complex molecules. Amidst an ever&#8208;growing number of enzymes, modular toolboxes of enzymatic transformations have been made available in synthesis today. Vast sets of biocatalysts are able to address manifold diversifications of interest, e.g., applied for drug development. In their Review on page&#8197;16824, Nicholas&#8197;J. Turner, Christian Schnepel et&#8197;al. discuss the present array of enzymatic late&#8208;stage modification.

A diverse range of halogenation strategies using nickel have been developed over the past decade. This Minireview will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8722;X reductive elimination, triflate&#8208;to&#8208;halogen exchange, directed C&#8722;H halogenation, non&#8208;directed electrophilic C&#8722;H halogenation, enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination, and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization&#8211;halogenation reactions including hydrohalogenation and carbohalogenation reactions.







Abstract
Nickel catalysis has demonstrated the capability of performing a broad range of synthetically challenging transformations over the last decade. Though recent literature has focused on the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds, a variety of breakthroughs in the field of C&#8722;X bond generation have also been reported. A diverse range of strategies using nickel have been developed, in an effort to expand the scope and synthetic utility of these halogenation methods. This Minireview will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8722;X reductive elimination, triflate&#8208;to&#8208;halogen exchange reactions, directed C&#8722;H halogenation, non&#8208;directed electrophilic C&#8722;H halogenation of arenes, enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination of carbonyl containing compounds, and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization&#8208;halogenation reactions. The final section has been split into two parts: nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrohalogenation and nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbohalogenation reactions.

This Minireview will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8722;X reductive elimination, triflate-to-halogen exchange reactions, directed C&#8722;H halogenation, non-directed electrophilic C&#8722;H halogenation of arenes, enantioselective &#945;-fluorination of carbonyl containing compounds, and 1,2-difunctionalization-halogenation reactions. The final section has been split into two parts: nickel-catalyzed hydrohalogenation and nickel-catalyzed carbohalogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities in the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16778-16799, July 26, 2021. </description>

This Review highlights the challenges in covalently modifying interlocked molecules, whereby the chemical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. Such routes can involve cleavage of the axle's main chain, but always with conservation of the mechanical bond, and allow access to more sophisticated interlocked molecules.







Abstract
Several strategies have been successfully utilised to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non&#8208;interlocked components because the requisites for self&#8208;assembly cannot always be enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, a strategy that consists of synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modification is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might greatly affect the reactivity of a functionality of the encircled axle, but that the interlocked architecture needs to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This Review focuses on the challenging post&#8208;synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through cleavage of the axle's main chain, but always with conservation of the mechanical bond.

         <title>Antitumor Agents Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

The design principles and structure&#8211;function relationships of antitumor agents based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized, and the current challenges and opportunities are also discussed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for biomedical applications owing to their unique properties. The porous structures make MOFs excellent candidates for the delivery of different drugs; the flexibility in choosing metal ions and organic ligands makes it feasible to prepare MOFs with intrinsic antitumor activities and further devise MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems; many other types of antitumor agents could also be developed using MOFs as the precursors/templates. Thus, the past two decades have witnessed the great development of MOF&#8208;based drugs, especially in the antitumor field. This Minireview mainly focuses on the design and applications of MOF&#8208;based antitumor agents. Four aspects covering the whole field are introduced: MOFs as carriers, MOFs as antitumor agents, MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems, and MOF&#8208;derived antitumor agents. The challenges and opportunities of MOFs for clinical antitumor applications are also discussed.

Aptamers, oligonucleotide&#8208;based recognition elements isolated from random libraries, have several favorable attributes for biosensing. This Review examines state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding aptamers and their use in various biosensors. Factors limiting aptamer&#8208;based sensors and potential solutions to these issues are also discussed.







Abstract
Aptamers are short oligonucleotides isolated in vitro from randomized libraries that can bind to specific molecules with high affinity, and offer a number of advantages relative to antibodies as biorecognition elements in biosensors. However, it remains difficult and labor&#8208;intensive to develop aptamer&#8208;based sensors for small&#8208;molecule detection. Here, we review the challenges and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding DNA aptamers and their use in sensors. First, we discuss in vitro methodologies for the isolation of aptamers, and provide guidance on selecting the appropriate strategy for generating aptamers with optimal binding properties for a given application. We next examine techniques for characterizing aptamer&#8211;target binding and structure. Afterwards, we discuss various small&#8208;molecule sensing platforms based on original or engineered aptamers, and their detection applications. Finally, we conclude with a general workflow to develop aptamer&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule sensors for real&#8208;world applications.

Late&#8208;stage modification is an indispensable approach for compound diversification in synthesis. Since enzymes offer particularly powerful means for mild, catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalisations, in recent years several novel biocatalytic methods have emerged enabling a broad array of orthogonal reactions. Herein, the wide range of late&#8208;stage biotransformations is reviewed and various enzyme classes along with topical examples are discussed.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis is gaining increasing importance in synthetic chemistry. Nowadays, the growing number of biocatalysts accessible by means of bioinformatics and enzyme engineering opens up an immense variety of selective reactions. Biocatalysis especially provides excellent opportunities for late&#8208;stage modification often superior to conventional de&#8197;novo synthesis. Enzymes have proven to be useful for direct introduction of functional groups into complex scaffolds, as well as for rapid diversification of compound libraries. Particularly important and highly topical are enzyme&#8208;catalysed oxyfunctionalisations, halogenations, methylations, reductions, and amide bond formations due to the high prevalence of these motifs in pharmaceuticals. This Review gives an overview of the strengths and limitations of enzymatic late&#8208;stage modifications using native and engineered enzymes in synthesis while focusing on important examples in drug development.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Cyanide and Isocyanides from CO</title>

The reactions of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO affords K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions. DFT calculations affirmed this reaction proceeds via an isocyanide intermediate. This was confirmed experimentally as the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) are shown to provide a facile route to the 19 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3 generally in high yields.







Abstract
The reaction of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO proceeds in C6D6 or THF affording K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions as confirmed by crystallographic characterization of K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)CN. Similarly reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) provides the corresponding 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3, generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph3Si&#8208;substituent is required to preclude 1,2&#8208;silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me3SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of 13C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of K[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO proceeds in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or THF affording K&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CN and O(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions as confirmed by crystallographic characterization of K(18-crown-6)CN. Similarly reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) provides the corresponding &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeled isocyanide RN&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and MOSiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si-substituent is required to preclude 1,2-silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regulating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activity of a Metal Coordination Polymer via d&#8211;&#960; Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16937-16941, July 26, 2021. </description>

A two&#8208;step strategy was proposed to optimize the ORR activity of TM&#8208;BTA (TM=Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA=1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) analogs by screening preliminarily TM centers and subsequently substituent groups. Strong d&#8211;&#960; conjugation in TM&#8208;BTA is found to elevate the dxz/dyz orbitals, which enhances the activity of TM centers, and also enlarges the impact of ligand functional groups on d orbitals of TM centers.







Abstract
Non&#8208;noble transition metal complexes have attracted growing interest as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while their activities still lack rational and effective regulation. Herein, we propose a d&#8211;&#960; conjugation strategy for rough and fine tuning of ORR activity of TM&#8208;BTA (TM=Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA=1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) coordination polymers. By first&#8208;principle calculations, we elucidate that the strong d&#8211;&#960; conjugation elevates the dxz/dyz orbitals of TM centers to enhance intermediate adsorption and strengthens the electronic modulation effect from substitute groups on ligands. Based on this strategy, Co&#8208;TABQ (tetramino benzoquinone) is found to approach the top of ORR activity volcano. The synthesized Co&#8208;TABQ with atomically distributed Co on carbon nanotubes exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a specific current of 127&#8197;mA&#8201;mgmetal&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. The high activity, low peroxide yield, and considerable durability of Co&#8208;BTA and Co&#8208;TABQ promise their application in oxygen electrocatalysis. This study provides mechanistic insight into the rational design of transition metal complex catalysts.

         <title>Phenacyl Phenothiazinium Salt as a New Broad&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Absorbing Photoinitiator for Cationic and Free Radical Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16917-16921, July 26, 2021. </description>

We report a new single component broad&#8208;band photoinitiator absorbing light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region for the initiation of free radical, cationic and hybrid polymerizations. This new photoinitiator may expand the curing application range of formulations of various pigmented systems.







Abstract
A novel broad&#8208;wavelength&#8208;absorbing photoinitiator based on phenacyl phenothiazinium hexafluroantimonate (P&#8208;PTh) possessing both phenacyl and phenothiazine chromophoric groups was reported. P&#8208;PTh absorbs light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region. Photophysical, photochemical, and computational investigations revealed that P&#8208;PTh in solution decomposes at all wavelengths by homolytic and heterolytic cleavages and generates cationic and radical species, which could efficiently initiate cationic and free radical polymerizations. It is anticipated that the photoinitiator with such wavelength flexibility may open up new pathways in curing applications of formulations of pigment systems.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate&#8211;Metalloviologen Hybrid: Reversible Intermolecular Three&#8208;Component Reaction and Temperature&#8208;Regulated Resistive Switching Behaviors</title>

An unusual polyoxometalate&#8208;metalloviologen hybrid with thermal&#8208;triggered reversible intermolecular multi&#8208;component reaction and structural transformation is made and used as a nonvolatile memristor, which exhibits unique temperature&#8208;regulated behavior and visual color changes for its silent and working states.







Abstract
The development of new&#8208;type memristors with special performance is of great interest. Herein, an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystalline polyoxometalate (POM) with usual dynamic structures is reported and used as active material for fabricating memristor with unique temperature&#8208;regulated resistive switching behaviors. The hybrid POM not only exhibits tunable thermochromic properties, but also thermal&#8208;induced reversible aggregation and disaggregation reactions, leading to reversible structural transformations in SCSC fashion. Further, the memory device using the hybrid POM as active layer exhibits uncommon performance, which can keep resistive switching silent in the low temperature range of 30&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C, but show nonvolatile memory behavior in the high temperature range of 150&#8211;270&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, the silent and working states at three special temperatures (30, 150 and 270&#8201;&#176;C) can be monitored by chromism. The correlation between structure and resistive switching property of the material has been discussed. The work demonstrates that crystalline inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid POMs are promising materials for making memristors with superior performance.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16984-16988, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic long persistent luminescence with afterglow lasting up to 20&#8211;40&#8197;minutes was achieved based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism at room temperature in a simple binary system. Through modulation of molecular structures and potential ISC channels between excited states, the afterglow profiles can be rationally tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46).







Abstract
Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow but with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized in a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can simultaneously harvest excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially one of the most promising candidates to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant molecules in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.

Investigation of deformylation rates in different cell types and developmental states using a novel synthesis route towards 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;fdC shows that deformylation is a wide spread process that is inversely correlated with cell division.







Abstract
Epigenetic programming of cells requires methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC) followed by oxidation to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). Subsequent transformation of fdC and cadC back to dC by various pathways establishes a chemical intra&#8208;genetic control circle. One of the discussed pathways involves the Tdg&#8208;independent deformylation of fdC directly to dC. Here we report the synthesis of a fluorinated fdC feeding probe (F&#8208;fdC) to study direct deformylation to F&#8208;dC. The synthesis was performed along a novel pathway that circumvents any F&#8208;dC as a reaction intermediate to avoid contamination interference. Feeding of F&#8208;fdC and observation of F&#8208;dC formation in vivo allowed us to gain insights into the Tdg&#8208;independent removal process. While deformylation was shown to occur in stem cells, we here provide data that prove deformylation also in different somatic cell types. We also investigated active demethylation in a non&#8208;dividing neurogenin&#8208;inducible system of iPS cells that differentiate into bipolar neurons.

         <title>Surface Engineering and Controlled Ripening for Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Au Islands on Au Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16958-16964, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of secondary structures on pre&#8208;existing metal seeds can be achieved by controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the degree of oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors. This method yields Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.







Abstract
Engineering the nucleation and growth of plasmonic metals (Ag and Au) on their pre&#8208;existing seeds is expected to produce nanostructures with unconventional morphologies and plasmonic properties that may find unique applications in sensing, catalysis, and broadband energy harvesting. Typical seed&#8208;mediated growth processes take advantage of the perfect lattice match between the deposited metal and seeds to induce conformal coating, leading to either simple size increases (e.g., Au on Au) or the formation of core&#8211;shell structures (e.g., Ag on Au) with limited morphology change. In this work, we show that the introduction of a thin layer of metal with considerable lattice mismatch can effectively induce the nucleation of well&#8208;defined Au islands on Au nanocrystal seeds. By controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors, we can regulate the number of islands on the seeds and produce complex Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.

         <title>Deciphering Competitive Routes for Nickel&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Electrodeposition by an Operando Optical Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16980-16983, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of electrodeposition can be challenging to predict in the absence of unambiguous electrochemical signature. Operando optical microscopy correlated to ex&#8197;situ SEM imaging allows probing mechanistic diversity with single nanoparticle resolution. It is illustrated by differentiating, with sub&#8208;25&#8197;nm size limit of detection, the electrodeposition of Ni and Ni(OH)2 NPs upon Ni2+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses since the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unraveled operando and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to ex situ SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)2 with a &lt;25&#8197;nm limit of detection, their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni2+ and water reduction. At the single NP level this results in a self&#8208;terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.

         <title>High Proton&#8208;Conductivity in Covalently Linked Polyoxometalate&#8208;Organoboronic Acid&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16953-16957, July 26, 2021. </description>

Polyoxometalate polymers with high proton conductivity are accessed for the first time by controlled covalent polymerization of Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type niobotungstate and organoboronic acid monomers. The resulting polymer features a purely inorganic backbone, organic sidechains, and acts as a solid&#8208;state proton conductor.







Abstract
The controlled bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with metal oxide backbones is a grand challenge in materials design, as it could give unique control over the resulting chemical properties. Herein, we report a 1D&#8208;organo&#8208;functionalized polyoxometalate polymer featuring a purely inorganic backbone. The polymer is self&#8208;assembled from two types of monomers, inorganic Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates, and aromatic organo&#8208;boronates. Their covalent linkage results in 1D polymer strands, which combine an inorganic oxide backbone (based on B&#8722;O and Nb&#8722;O linkages) with functional organic side&#8208;chains. The polymer shows high bulk proton conductivity of up to 1.59&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. This synthetic approach could lead to a new class of organic&#8211;inorganic polymers where function can be designed by controlled tuning of the monomer units.

         <title>A Molecular Hybrid of an Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster and Polyoxometalates for H2 Cleavage into Protons and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16994-16998, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular hybrid of an atomically precise mixed&#8208;valent {Ag27}17+ nanocluster and polyoxometalate (POM) ligands exhibited unique reactivity, efficiently cleaving dihydrogen (H2) into protons and electrons. The protons and electrons generated are stored on the POM surface and the mixed&#8208;valent {Ag27}17+ nanoclusters, respectively.







Abstract
Atomically precise silver (Ag) nanoclusters are promising materials as catalysts, photocatalysts, and sensors because of their unique structures and mixed&#8208;valence states (Ag+/Ag0). However, their low stability hinders the in&#8208;depth study of their intrinsic reactivity and catalytic property accompanying their redox processes. Herein, we demonstrate that a molecular hybrid of an atomically precise {Ag27}17+ nanocluster and polyoxometalates (POMs) can efficiently cleave H2 into protons and electrons. The Ag nanocluster accommodates electrons through the redox reaction from {Ag27}17+ to {Ag27}13+, and the POM ligands play the following important roles: (i) a significant stabilization of the typically unstable Ag nanocluster to preserve its structure during the redox reaction with H2, (ii) formation of a unique interface between the Ag nanocluster and metal oxides for efficient H2 cleavage, and (iii) storage of the generated protons on the negatively charged basic surface.

The Ag nanocluster accommodates electrons through the redox reaction from {Ag&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;17+&lt;/sup&gt; to {Ag&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the POM ligands play the following important roles: (i) a significant stabilization of the typically unstable Ag nanocluster to preserve its structure during the redox reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, (ii) formation of a unique interface between the Ag nanocluster and metal oxides for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleavage, and (iii) storage of the generated protons on the negatively charged basic surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemosensor for the Selective and Visual Recognition of Glucose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16880-16884, July 26, 2021. </description>

A novel sugar fluorescent chemosensor which combines a vibrational&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (VIE)&#8208;active DPAC core and two N&#8208;methylaminomethylphenylboronic acid moieties can detect glucose within seconds and discriminate between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood.







Abstract
The development of chemosensors to detect analytes in biologically relevant solutions is a challenging task. We report the synthesis of a fluorescent receptor that combines vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) and dynamic covalent chemistry for the detection of glucose in aqueous media. We show that the bis&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;methylaminomethyl)phenylboronic acid&#8208;decorated N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) receptor 1 can detect glucose and discriminate between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood. Preliminary studies suggest monosaccharides bind to the DPAC&#8208;receptor with a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce pseudomacrocyclic complexes, which in turn leads to distinct optical changes in the fluorescent emission of the receptor for each host. Moreover, the complexation&#8208;induced change in emission can be detected visually and quantified in a ratiometric way. Our results highlight the potential of VIE&#8208;type receptors for the quantitative determination of saccharides in biological samples.

         <title>The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on Cluster Formation: Pentamer, Hexamers and Heptamer of Difluoromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16894-16899, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;limit of cluster investigation is pushed forward in this high&#8208;resolution gas phase rotational spectroscopy study. This is the first detection of a pentamer, two hexamers and one heptamer of difluoromethane, through a synergic work of theoretical protocols and advanced experiments. This intricate balance of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions is analyzed in&#8208;depth.







Abstract
The role of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) has broadened with the inclusion of new types of interactions and a plethora of weak donor/acceptor partners. This work illustrates the potential of chirped&#8208;pulse Fourier transform microwave technique, which has revolutionized the field of rotational spectroscopy. In particular, it has been exploited to reveal the role of NCIs&#8217; in the molecular self&#8208;aggregation of difluoromethane where a pentamer, two hexamers and a heptamer were detected. The development of a new automated assignment program and a sophisticated computational screening protocol was essential for identifying the homoclusters in conditions of spectral congestion. The major role of dispersion forces leads to less directional interactions and more distorted structures than those found in polar clusters, although a detailed analysis demonstrates that the dominant interaction energy is the pairwise interaction. The tetramer cluster is identified as a structural unit in larger clusters, representing the maximum expression of bond between dimers.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Sequential Catalysis Featuring Two Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16932-16936, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral transition&#8208;metal catalysts are combined in one pot to perform orthogonal asymmetric transformations. Simple allyl enol carbonates are converted to ketones bearing two non&#8208;contiguous stereogenic centers via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation followed by a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Hayashi&#8211;Miyaura conjugate addition. This sequential catalysis process is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent and exhibits statistical amplification of enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
This study demonstrates the feasibility and inherent benefits of combining two distinct asymmetric transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one pot. The reported transformation features a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation and a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition, effectively converting simple allyl enol carbonate precursors into enantioenriched cyclic ketones with two remote stereocenters. Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst control, this one&#8208;pot reaction is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis of a Cy5 fluorophore via carbon radical&#8208;participating trimerization, was designed by virtue of the self&#8208;photocatalytic activity of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives. The in situ photochemical reaction was achieved selectively in lysosomes of living cells in an irradiation time&#8208;dependent manner, potentially applicable for spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Photoactivated trimerization of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives created near infrared fluorophore Cy5. The synthetic method is air&#8208;tolerant, photosensitizer free, metal free, and condensation agent free. Living cells make Cy5 on a time scale of minutes under white light irradiation at a low power intensity, with the monomer as the only exogenous agent. The new method is promising to find applications in cell studies for in situ spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.

         <title>Thiols Act as Methyl Traps in the Biocatalytic Demethylation of Guaiacol Derivatives</title>

Efficient demethylation of methyl phenyl ethers was achieved by biocatalytic O2&#8208;free methyl transfer to thiols forming thio ethers. Since the methyl group is not cleaved from the sulfur under these conditions, the thiol compound acts like a trap driving the reaction towards completion.







Abstract
Demethylating methyl phenyl ethers is challenging, especially when the products are catechol derivatives prone to follow&#8208;up reactions. For biocatalytic demethylation, monooxygenases have previously been described requiring molecular oxygen which may cause oxidative side reactions. Here we show that such compounds can be demethylated anaerobically by using cobalamin&#8208;dependent methyltransferases exploiting thiols like ethyl 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate as a methyl trap. Using just two equivalents of this reagent, a broad spectrum of substituted guaiacol derivatives were demethylated, with conversions mostly above 90&#8201;%. This strategy was used to prepare the highly valuable antioxidant hydroxytyrosol on a one&#8208;gram scale in 97&#8201;% isolated yield.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demethylating methyl phenyl ethers is challenging, especially when the products are catechol derivatives prone to follow-up reactions. For biocatalytic demethylation, monooxygenases have previously been described requiring molecular oxygen which may cause oxidative side reactions. Here we show that such compounds can be demethylated anaerobically by using cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases exploiting thiols like ethyl 3-mercaptopropionate as a methyl trap. Using just two equivalents of this reagent, a broad spectrum of substituted guaiacol derivatives were demethylated, with conversions mostly above 90&#8201;%. This strategy was used to prepare the highly valuable antioxidant hydroxytyrosol on a one-gram scale in 97&#8201;% isolated yield.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Discovery of Novel Bacterial Chalcone Isomerases by a Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution Strategy for Enzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flavanones</title>

Novel bacterial chalcone isomerases and their variants identified by a Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution (SSFE) strategy are able to convert chalcones to flavanones with diverse substrate scopes and strict (S)&#8208;stereopreference enabling a biocatalytic route to (S)&#8208;flavanones.







Abstract
Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. The first bacterial CHI (CHIera) was identified from Eubacterium ramulus, but its distribution, evolutionary source, substrate scope, and stereoselectivity are still unclear. Here, we describe the identification of 66 novel bacterial CHIs from Genbank using a novel Sequence&#8208;Structure&#8208;Function&#8208;Evolution (SSFE) strategy. These novel bacterial CHIs show diversity in substrate specificity towards various hydroxylated and methoxylated chalcones. The mutagenesis of CHIera according to the substrate binding models of these novel bacterial CHIs resulted in several variants with greatly improved activity towards these chalcones. Furthermore, the preparative scale conversion catalyzed by bacterial CHIs has been performed for five chalcones and revealed (S)&#8208;selectivity with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, which provides an alternative biocatalytic route for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;flavanones in high yields.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Insertion of Furyl Carbene into the N&#8722;H Bond of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16942-16946, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion has been accomplished for the first time by using enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. Distinct with the selective O&#8722;H insertion of pyridones for diazo compounds, this reaction occurs exclusively on the desired nitrogen atom. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective O&#8208;to&#8208;C 1,4&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Asymmetric carbene insertion reactions represent one of the most important protocols to construct carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The use of donor&#8211;acceptor diazo compounds bearing an ester group is however a prerequisite for achieving high enantioselectivity. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion of 2&#8208;pyridones that has been accomplished for the first time with enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective 1,4&#8208;proton transfer from O to C. The rhodium catalyst provides a chiral pocket in which the steric repulsion and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the propeller ligand play a critical role in determining the selectivities.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Nanodisc Formation of Non&#8208;ionic Polymers**

         <dc:description>
Hydrophobically functionalized fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin polymers were synthesized and demonstrated to form lipid bilayer nanodiscs. These non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymer&#8208;based nanodiscs are stable against pH and divalent metal ions and they align magnetically in the presence of an external magnetic field. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
Although lipid nanodiscs are increasingly used in the structural studies of membrane proteins, drug delivery and other applications, the interaction between the nanodisc belt and the protein to be reconstituted is a major limitation. To overcome this limitation and to further broaden the scope of nanodiscs, a family of non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymers synthesized by hydrophobic functionalization of fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin is reported. We show the stability of lipid nanodiscs formed by these polymers against pH and divalent metal ions, and their magnetic&#8208;alignment properties. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.

Pre&#8208;formed oxidative addition complexes (OACs) are utilized to selectively arylate p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) in the presence of native functional groups, except cysteine. In phosphate buffer pH&#8197;7.5, OACs derived from electron&#8208;poor arenes provide full conversion in as little as 2&#8197;hours at micromolar concentration. A complimentary procedure using the weak base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN) is also presented enabling arylation with electron&#8208;rich substrates with up to 97&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
The selective N&#8208;arylation of p&#8208;aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre&#8208;formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH2 group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N&#8208;terminus via Curtin&#8211;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron&#8208;poor aryl halides, p&#8208;aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non&#8208;nucleophilic, organic base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron&#8208;rich functional groups provides up to 97&#8201;% conversion. These procedures enable the chemoselective conjugation of functionally diverse small molecule pharmaceuticals to p&#8208;aminophenylalanine containing derivatives of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208;Dyad Molecular Probe for the Simultaneous Profiling of the Evolution of Multiple Radical Species During Bacterial Infections</title>

The molecular probe HCy5&#8208;Cy7 turns on its emission at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical&#8208;mediated oxidation of the reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation leads to the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. This allows the imaging of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes of bacterial infection in both macrophage cells and living mice.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of the evolution of bacterial infection&#8208;associated multiple radical species is critical to accurately profile the pathogenesis and host&#8208;defense mechanisms. Here, we present a unique dual wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) cyanine&#8208;dyad molecular probe (HCy5&#8208;Cy7) for simultaneous monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) variations both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. HCy5&#8208;Cy7 specifically turns on its fluorescence at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical (O2.&#8722;, .OH)&#8208;mediated oxidation of reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species (ONOO&#8722;, ClO&#8722;)&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation causes the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. Such multispectral but reverse signal responses allow multiplex manifestation of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes in both bacteria&#8208;infected macrophage cells and living mice. Most importantly, this study may also provide new perspectives for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis and advancing the precision medicine against infectious diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The molecular probe HCy5-Cy7 turns on its emission at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of the reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species-induced Cy7 structural degradation leads to the emission turn-off at 800&#8197;nm. This allows the imaging of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes of bacterial infection in both macrophage cells and living mice.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Highly Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; Multifunctionalization of Borylated Dendralenes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tetra&#8208;component reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles is reported. The method allows for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; introduction of diverse functionalities which serve as a versatile handle to access complex dienic structures.







Abstract
Despite the high relevance of 1,3&#8208;dienes, stereoselective methods to access tetrasubstituted conjugated dienes are still scarce. We here report an efficient and modular approach that provides access to multifunctional tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. This methodology is based on a tetracomponent reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles. Mechanistic studies reveal that this transformation proceeds through a regio&#8208; and stereoselective carbolithiation/electrophilic trapping of an in situ formed dendralenic boron&#8208;ate complex, followed by a stereoretentive halodeborylation. The ease in which complex structural dienes can be accessed and their synthetic versatility highlight the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16989-16993, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes has been realized for the synthesis of chiral propargylamines with high efficiency (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and TON=2000). Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex exhibits an activating effect for the initiation of the plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most powerful methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds. However, the chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of the relatively inert unsaturated group in substrates possessing multiple unsaturated bonds remains a challenge. We herein report a protocol for the highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes while keeping the alkynyl bond intact. Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex plays a critical role to initiate a plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle. This approach allows for the highly efficient generation of chiral propargylamines (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and 2000 S/C) and further useful chemical transformations.

         <title>An Organic Host&#8211;Guest System Producing Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence at the Parts&#8208;Per&#8208;Billion Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16970-16973, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent naphthalimides, which did not originally show observable phosphorescence, can now efficiently produce ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in phthalimide hosts. In particular, red RTP is realized by doping at a guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio at the 10&#8197;parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) level.







Abstract
Manipulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons in organic molecules is key to applications including next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, background&#8208;free bioimaging, information encryption, and photodynamic therapy. However, for organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), which stems from triplet excitons, it is still difficult to simultaneously achieve efficiency and lifetime enhancement on account of weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling and rapid nonradiative transitions, especially in the red and near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, we report that a series of fluorescent naphthalimides&#8212;which did not originally show observable phosphorescence in solution, as aggregates, in polymer films, or in any other tested host material, including heavy&#8208;atom matrices at cryogenic temperatures&#8212;can now efficiently produce ultralong RTP (&#981;=0.17, &#964;=243&#8197;ms) in phthalimide hosts. Notably, red RTP (&#955;RTP=628&#8197;nm) is realized at a molar ratio of less than 10&#8197;parts per billion, demonstrating an unprecedentedly low guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio where efficient RTP can take place in molecular solids.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Hydroamination of Push&#8211;Pull&#8208;Activated Linear Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A rapid and regioselective click reaction between N,N&#8208;dialkylhydroxylamines and linear alkynes is described. This bioorthogonal reaction between two small components is enabled by the rehybridization effect of terminally halogenated alkynes and the careful balancing of alkyne &#960;&#8208;electron density through a push&#8211;pull mechanism.







Abstract
A bioorthogonal reaction between N,N&#8208;dialkylhydroxylamines and push&#8211;pull&#8208;activated halogenated alkynes is described. We explore the use of rehybridization effects in activating alkynes, and we show that electronic effects, when competing stereoelectronic and inductive factors are properly balanced, sufficiently activate a linear alkyne in the uncatalyzed conjugative retro&#8208;Cope elimination reaction while adequately protecting it against cellular nucleophiles. This design preserves the low steric profile of an alkyne and pairs it with a comparably unobtrusive hydroxylamine. The kinetics are on par with those of the fastest strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions, the products regioselectively formed, the components sufficiently stable and easily installed, and the reaction suitable for cellular labeling.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Templated Coupling of B=N Units: Synthesis of BNBN Analogues of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and a Butatriene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16864-16868, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [&#956;&#8208;(dmpm)Pt]2 template promotes the coupling of B=N units derived from dihalo(silylamino)borane precursors by B&#8722;N bond formation through intermolecular halosilane elimination. For Cl2BNR(SiMe3) &#951;1&#8208;(N&#8208;aminoboryl)aminoboryl and &#951;1&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;diazaboretidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl PtI2 complexes are obtained, whereas for Br2BN(SiMe3)2 an A&#8208;frame complex bridged by the first BNBN analogue of a butatriene is formed, as confirmed by structural and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
The 1:2 reaction of [&#956;&#8208;(dmpm)Pt(nbe)]2 (dmpm=bis(dimethylphosphino)methane, nbe=norbornene) with Cl2BNR(SiMe3) (R=tBu, SiMe3) yields unsymmetrical (N&#8208;aminoboryl)aminoboryl PtI2 complexes by B&#8722;N coupling via ClSiMe3 elimination. A subsequent intramolecular ClSiMe3 elimination from the tBu&#8208;derivative leads to cyclization of the BNBN unit, forming a unique 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand. In contrast, the analogous reaction with Br2BN(SiMe3)2 leads, via a twofold BrSiMe3 elimination, to a PtII2 A&#8208;frame complex bridged by a linear BNBN isostere of butatriene. Structural and computational data confirm &#960;&#8197;electron delocalization over the entire BNBN unit.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Switchable Catalysis for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Cyclic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 31, Page 16974-16979, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a switchable catalytic system that involves ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2 and photo&#8208;induced intramolecular radical addition has been demonstrated. It enabled the direct synthesis of well&#8208;defined cyclic polyesters and cyclic CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates from mixtures of monomers in an efficient process.







Abstract
A cobalt salen pentenoate complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] is rationally designed as the catalyst for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2. Via migratory insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into the Co&#8722;O bonds, the ROCOP&#8208;active species &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O&#8208;CoIII(salen) can be rapidly and quantitatively transformed into &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O2C&#8208;CoIII(salen) telechelic linear precursors. Upon dilution of reaction mixtures, the homolytic cleavage of Co&#8722;C bonds induced by visible light generates &#945;&#8208;alkene acyl radicals that spontaneously undergo intramolecular radical addition to afford organocobalt&#8208;functionalized cyclic polyesters and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates with excellent regioselectivity. The cyclic products can either react with radical scavengers to generate metal&#8208;free cyclic polymers or serve as photo&#8208;initiators for organometallic&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (OMRP) to produce tadpole&#8208;shaped copolymers.

         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8211;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14</title>

         <dc:description>
Water molecules must arrange around an aluminum hydride&#8211;hydroxide unit in a specific way to enable elimination of molecular hydrogen. Infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy reveals that hydrogen bonding to the hydride takes place in a six&#8208;coordinate AlIII hydride&#8211;hydroxide complex. The smallest cluster size for which hydride hydrogen bonding dominates is also the cluster size for which hydrogen evolution becomes efficient.







Abstract
Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1850&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to the Al&#8722;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n=12. The frequency of the Al&#8722;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded Al&#8722;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8722;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8722;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Beam Search for Automated Design and Scoring of Novel ROR Ligands with Machine Intelligence**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beam search algorithm was employed for automated molecule design and scoring from a chemical language model (CLM). Prospective application of this model&#8208;intrinsic technique with a CLM trained on inverse ROR&#947; agonists yielded novel ligands of this nuclear receptor with the intended bioactivity. Beam search sampling overcomes the need for external scoring methods and extends the applicability of machine learning&#8208;driven molecular design.







Abstract
Chemical language models enable de&#8197;novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. Herein, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.

         <title>Aminocatalytic [8+2] Cycloaddition Reactions toward Chiral Cyclazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyclic cycl[3.2.2]azines, containing a central&#8208;ring&#8208;junction nitrogen atom, have been accessed through aminocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions. Pyrrolizine&#8208;based 8&#960;&#8208;components were prepared and used in catalytic [8+2] cycloaddition reactions with diverse activated enals. The developed procedure enabled the synthesis of the cycloadducts, which contain four adjacent stereocenters, with exceptional stereoselectivity (see scheme).







Abstract
An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis of chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (E)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition reactions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.

         <title>Multicatalytic Transformation of (Meth)acrylic Acids: a One&#8208;Pot Approach to Biobased Poly(meth)acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a multicatalytic approach for the one&#8208;pot production of (meth)acrylate monomers, allowing the formation of the corresponding (co)polymers from renewable feedstocks. This highly efficient strategy allowed us to perform multiple catalytic transformations in one pot, while bypassing several purification steps. This procedure can therefore minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practicalities.







Abstract
Shifting from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources can address some of the environmental issues associated with petrochemical extraction and make plastics production sustainable. Therefore, there is a growing interest in selective methods for transforming abundant renewable feedstocks into monomers suitable for polymer production. Reported herein are one&#8208;pot catalytic systems, that are active, productive, and selective under mild conditions for the synthesis of copolymers from renewable materials. Each system allows for anhydride formation, alcohol acylation and/or acid esterification, as well as polymerization of the formed (meth)acrylates, providing direct access to a new library of unique poly(meth)acrylates.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Monitoring of Spatially Segregated Enzymatic Reactions in Multilayered Hydrogel Assemblies**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. This system is used to monitor the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. We observed the parallel activities of urease, catalase, and glucose oxidase by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled.

         <title>In Situ Implanting of Single Tungsten Sites into Defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by Solvent&#8208;Free Route for Efficient Oxidative Desulfurization at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The W/UiO&#8208;66(Zr) SSCs display extraordinary ODS activity under very mild condition, achieving complete oxidation of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min by using diluted H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
Design of single&#8208;site catalysts with catalytic sites at atomic&#8208;scale and high atom utilization, provides new opportunities to gain superior catalytic performance for targeted reactions. In this contribution, we report a one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free condition. The catalysts displayed extraordinary activity for the oxidative removal of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min. The turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 44.0&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, which is 109.0, 12.3 and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine UiO&#8208;66(Zr), WO3, and WCl6 (homogeneous catalyst). Theoretical and experimental studies show that the anchored W sites can react with oxidant readily and generate WVI&#8208;peroxo intermediates that determine the reaction activity. Our work not only manifests the application of SSCs in the field of desulfurization of fuel oil but also opens a new solvent&#8208;free avenue for fabricating MOFs based SSCs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Sweat&#8208;Based Tracking of L&#8208;Dopa Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following an Oral Tablet Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Non&#8208;invasive touch&#8208;based sweat measurements are used for tracking the pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration.







Abstract
Levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L&#8208;Dopa long&#8208;term use is associated with the development of motor and non&#8208;motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L&#8208;Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase&#8208;modified electrode, where sweat L&#8208;Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose&#8208;response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch&#8208;based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples.

         <title>Current&#8208;Density Regulating Lithium Metal Directional Deposition for Long Cycle&#8208;Life Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of Li metal anode was designed, in which, the CCA layer working as charge organizer was placed between the current collector and the anode. It makes the main Li depositional interface transfer to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface, which effectively protects the separate. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells were significantly improved.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8220;orientated&#8208;growth&#8221; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer that induces a high current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both in situ and ex situ images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. The electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LFP full cell capable of maintaining 94&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Highly Active PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 Nanocomposites Supported on One Dimensional Halloysite Nanotubes for Photoassisted Thermal Catalytic Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One dimentional halloysite nanotubes supported PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 nanocomposites have good visible light response, which showed excellent performance in photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion. Its light&#8208;off temperature could be largely reduced to as low as 180&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy inspires us much to design photocatalysts for a variety of thermal catalytic reactions involved by active oxygen species under milder conditions.







Abstract
In this work, we have successfully triggered the aqueous auto&#8208;redox reactions between reductive Ce(OH)3 and oxidative MnO4&#8722;/Pd2+ ions to form PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 (PMC) nanocomposites. PMC could spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into compact encapsulation on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) to form the final one dimensional HNTs supported PMCs (HPMC). It is identified that there exists strong synergistic effects among the components of PdO, Mn3O4, and CeO2, and hence HPMC could show excellent performance on photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion that its light&#8208;off temperature was sharply reduced to be 180&#8201;&#176;C under visible light irradiation. Based on detailed studies, it is found that the catalytic reaction process well follows the classic MVK mechanism, and adsorption/activation of O2 into active oxygen species (O*) should be the rate&#8208;determining step for CH4 conversion.

         <title>Efficient Inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Using Chimeric oligonucleotides through RNase L Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently there is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs and alleviate current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Although many candidates have been developed, we here designed and constructed chimeric oligonucleotides comprising a 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe modified antisense oligonucleotide and a 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)  4  (4A  2&#8208;5  ) to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A  2&#8208;5  was used for guided ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation to sequence&#8208;specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as only 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe modified oligonucleotides for both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, one of the chimeras targeting spike RNA achieved potent and broad&#8208;spectrum inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its N501Y and/or &#916;H69/&#916;V70 mutants. These encouraging results direct another possible path using above chimeric oligonucleotides to further develop antiviral agents to combat COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Enterocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chemical total synthesis of the highly oxygenated polyketide enterocin has been accomplished. The key step of the synthesis was a late&#8208;stage biomimetic reaction cascade involving two intramolecular aldol reactions in which each step proceeded in 52% yield (averaged) and which established four of the seven stereogenic centers. The pivotal precursor for the cascade reaction was assembled from three readily available building blocks. A chiral dithioacetal with two stereogenic centers originating from L&#8208;arabinose represented the core fragment to both ends of which the other building blocks were attached by aldol reactions. The remaining stereogenic center was installed by Davis oxygenation immediately prior to the key step.</dc:description>

         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it remains great challenge to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without external power supply. Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)&#160;in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers, which offer an unprecedented opportunity in this regard. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  PbBr  4  (  1  ), we successfully obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  CsPb  2  Br  7&#160;  (  2  ), which is composed of bilayered perovskites sheets of corner&#8208;sharing PbBr  6  octahedra. Emphatically, converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite arouses a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features promise the fabrication of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410 &#181;C Gy  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  &#160;at zero bias, which is even much superior to the value of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art  &#945;  &#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias. Our work demonstrates vast perspectives for the application of the ferroelectric semiconductors for photovoltaic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A big problem with the chemistry literature is that it is not standardized with respect to precise operational parameters, and real time corrections are hard to make without expert knowledge. This lack of context means difficult reproducibility because many steps are ambiguous, and hence depend on tacit knowledge. Here we present the integration of online NMR into an automated chemical synthesis machine (CSM aka. &#8216;Chemputer&#8217; which is capable of small&#8208;molecule synthesis using a universal programming language) to allow automated analysis and adjustment of reactions on the fly. The system was validated and benchmarked by using Grignard reactions which were chosen due to their importance in synthesis. The system was monitored in real time using online&#8208;NMR, and spectra were measured continuously during the reactions. This shows that the synthesis being done in the Chemputer can be dynamically controlled in response to feedback optimizing the reaction conditions according to the user requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mobility Organic Lasing Semiconductor with Crystallization&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , Fabry&#8722;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86 uJ cm  &#8208;2  and a high&#8208;quality factor of ~ 2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of n/p&#8208;type Phenothiazine Organic Scaffold for Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type or n&#8208;type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n&#8208;type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&lt; 0.8 V vs. Zn/Zn  2+  ), while the p&#8208;type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&lt; 100 mAh g  &#8208;1  ). Here we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) containing both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p&#8208;type at low potential + p&#8208;type at high potential) by using experiments and theoretical calculations. It is found that such hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n and p&#8208;type reactions and compensates for the drawback of each other. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn//PTD&#8208;1 full cell shows a high voltage (e.g., 1.8 V  maximum  or 1.1 V  average  ), a high capacity 188.24 mAh g  PTD&#8208;1  &#8208;1  (achieved at 40 mA g  &#8208;1  ), a long&#8208;life and a supercapacitor&#8208;like high power. These results shed new light on the design of advanced organic electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high mechanical strength and incombustibility have great potential in completely addressing the safety issues of liquid batteries, but the poor interface contact between them and the electrodes hinders their practical applications. Here, coordination chemistry of nitrile groups based on succinonitrile (SCN) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is studied on the surface of Li  6.4  La  3  Zr  1.4  Ta  0.6  O  12  (LLZTO) SSE to build the chemical bonded electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The coordination of the nitrile group and LLZTO is clarified in detail by experiments and density functional theory calculations. And a deformable PAN&#8208;modifying SCN electrolyte (PSE) interphase with stable ionic conductivity (10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  ) and high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (0.66) is fabricated on the surface of LLZTO electrolyte based on the coordination competition of nitrile groups. Once applied to SSBs, it endows low interface resistance and strong bonding for the electrolyte/electrode interfaces so that the initial Coulomb efficiency reaches 95.6% and the capacity remains 99% after 250 cycles at 25  o  C.</dc:description>

Here, coordination chemistry of nitrile groups based on succinonitrile (SCN) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is studied on the surface of Li  6.4  La  3  Zr  1.4  Ta  0.6  O  12  (LLZTO) SSE to build the chemical bonded electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The coordination of the nitrile group and LLZTO is clarified in detail by experiments and density functional theory calculations. And a deformable PAN-modifying SCN electrolyte (PSE) interphase with stable ionic conductivity (10  -4  S cm  -1  ) and high lithium-ion transference number (0.66) is fabricated on the surface of LLZTO electrolyte based on the coordination competition of nitrile groups. Once applied to SSBs, it endows low interface resistance and strong bonding for the electrolyte/electrode interfaces so that the initial Coulomb efficiency reaches 95.6% and the capacity remains 99% after 250 cycles at 25  o  C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#173;Porous metal&#8208;organic framework liquids for enhanced CO2 adsorption and catalytic conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique applications of porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) liquids with permanent porosity and fluidity have attracted significant attention. However, fabrication of porous MOF liquids remains challenging because of the easy intermolecular self&#8208;filling of the cavity or the rapid settlement of porous hosts in hindered solvents that cannot enter their pores. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a MOF liquid (Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL) by surface ionization of an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized framework with a sterically hindered poly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (PEGS) canopy. The Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL obtained in this way has a CO2 adsorption approximately 14 times larger than that of pure PEGS. Distinct from a porous MOF solid counterpart, the stored CO2 in Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL can be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize cyclic carbonates in the atmosphere. This is the first example of the use of a porous MOF liquid as a CO2 storage material for catalysis. It offers a new method for the fabrication of unique porous liquid MOFs with functional behaviors in various fields of gas adsorption and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Exquisite vesicular nanomedicine by paclitaxel mediated co&#8208;assembly with camptothecin prodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;component molecular drug amphiphiles often suffer from the suboptimal parameters during the self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of tubes and/or filaments with lengths up to micrometers, which hampers the biomedical applications. Here, we report that the self&#8208;assembly of drug amphiphiles, Evans blue conjugated camptothecin prodrug (EB&#8208;CPT), can be modulated by another anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), resulting in ultrahigh quality of nanovesicles (NVs) with uniform shape and diameters of around 80 nm with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, denoted as ECX NVs. Significantly, the co&#8208;assembly of EB&#8208;CPT and PTX without adding other excipients has nearly 100% drug loading efficiency (DLE) and ultrahigh drug loading content (DLC) of PTX alone of up to 72.3 &#177; 1.7 wt% which, to our best knowledge, is among the highest level reported in literature. Moreover, the ECX NVs with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:2 showed remarkable combination index of 0.59 at a level of 50% efficacy against HCT116 cells in vitro and greatly improved tumor inhibition effect in vivo compared with two clinically approved CPT&#8208; and PTX&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines (Onivyde and Abraxane) individually and their combinations. This study presents a novel exquisite vesicular nanomedicine with ultrahigh DLC and DLE through a co&#8208;assembly strategy, which may shed new light on anticancer drug development and translational medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Dynamics, Structure and Magnetism of Switchable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via 1H&#8208;Detected MAS NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a toolbox for the rapid characterisation of powdered samples of paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks at natural abundance by  1  H detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Very fast (60 kHz) MAS rates at room and cryogenic temperatures and a set of tailored radiofrequency irradiation schemes are leveraged to overcome the sensitivity and resolution limits often associated with the characterization of new MOF materials. We demonstrate the approach on DUT&#8208;8(Ni), a framework containing Ni  2+  paddle&#8208;wheel units which can exist in two markedly different architec&#8208;tures. Resolved  1  H and  13  C resonances of organic linkers are detected and assigned in few hours with only 1&#8208;2 mg of sample at natural isotopic abundance, and used to rapidly extract important information on structure and local internal dynamics of the assemblies, as well as to elucidate the metal electronic properties over an extended temperature range. The experiments described disclose a wealth of new possibilities for describ&#8208;ing local and global structural changes and correlating them to electronic and magnetic properties of the assemblies, ultimately improving our ability to tune their macroscopic physicochemical behaviour.</dc:description>
